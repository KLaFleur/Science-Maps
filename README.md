# Science-Maps
Overview

	This project takes as input a search for something that would be the subject of scientific research, 
	and a number of articles to scrape from and returns a csv of locations found in the abstracts of the 
	articles returned by the desired search (using sciencedirect.com)


	


Next Steps 

	Add support for U.S National park, protected areas, and forests around the world 

	Look into an issue where the scraper returns 404 errors on ~15% of links it runs

	Link location results to the title of the article from which they came 

	Add comments to functions
