# Science-Maps


## Overview
This project takes as input a search for something that would be the 
subject of scientific research and a number of articles to scrape from, and returns a csv of locations found in the abstracts of the articles returned by the desired search (using [sciencedirect.com](sciencedirect.com) ). 
These locations are determined by checking the text of all abstracts found against a dictionary of ~7,000 cities and countries. The user 
imports the csv to google maps. An example map with a few different 
searches can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uSapi_Us20bfaV65zegpFPFT6kr9oFDk&usp=sharing).


## Usage
I wrote this script as a tool to discover trends in research practices. These insights are meaningful on a few levels. For one, it's fun to check out patterns in research for certain animals, plants, or geographical features (Figure. 1). On a more serious note, the script can illuminate imbalances in research location, which can have serious social implications and dire consequences for the integrity of the research.





## Next Steps  

* Integrate a named entity recognition tool, such as the [Stanford Natural Language Processing group]'s (https://nlp.stanford.edu/) [Named Entity Recognizer](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html) coupled with the geocoding function of the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to detect and get coordinates for locations that aren't loaded into the dictionary. 

* Add support for protected areas, mountain ranges, and forests around the world(only U.S. National parks are supported as of now)

* Look into an issue where the scraper returns 404 errors on ~25% of links it runs 

* Link location results to the title of the article that they came from
