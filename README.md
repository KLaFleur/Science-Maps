# Science-Maps
Overview
	This project takes as input a search for something that would be the subject of scientific research, and a number of articles to scrape from and returns a csv of locations found in the abstracts of the articles returned by the desired search (using sciencedirect.com)

(more stuff )


Next Steps 
	To add support for U.S National parks then for protected areas around the world 
	To look into an issue where the scraper returns 404 errors on ~15% of links it runs
