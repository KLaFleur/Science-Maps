# Science-Maps
Overview

	This project takes as input a search for something that would be the subject of scientific research, 
	and a number of articles to scrape from and returns a csv of locations found in the abstracts of the articles returned by the desired search (using sciencedirect.com) The user imports the csv to google maps. An example map with a few different searches can be found at 
	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uSapi_Us20bfaV65zegpFPFT6kr9oFDk&usp=sharing .


	


Next Steps 

	Add support for U.S National parks, protected areas, mountain ranges, and forests around the world 

	Look into an issue where the scraper returns 404 errors on ~15% of links it runs

	Link location results to the title of the article from which they came 

	add support for locations with multiple words. 'san francisco', 'olympic national park', etc.
