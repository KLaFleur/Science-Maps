# Science-Maps
Overview

	This project takes as input a scientific research topic and a 
	number of articles to scrape from and returns a csv of locations 
	found in the abstracts of the articles returned by the desired search (using sciencedirect.com).
	


	


Next Steps 

	Add support for U.S National parks, protected areas, mountain ranges, and forests around the world 

	Look into an issue where the scraper returns 404 errors on ~30% of links it runs

	Link location results to the title of the article from which they came 

	Add comments to functions 

	Clean out old, commented out code
