ScienceDirect title Fe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (483KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Tagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title TdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Fe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice.

ScienceDirect title Dushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title Two groups of mixed sporopollen assemblage were classified by color in Dushanzi mud volcano ejecta.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title The main composition of light color group may be mainly derived from the Miocene strata.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title The darker color group might be from the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic strata.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title Dushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records.

Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirect title Among the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body.

It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title In order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Now at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Andesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title The heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title The Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Dacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Volcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts.

The rocks from Kamen and Ploskie Sopky volcanoes differ systematically in major elemental and mineral compositions and could not have been produced from the same primary melts. The compositional trends of Kamen stratovolcano lavas and dikes are clearly distinct from those of Klyuchevskoy lavas in all major and trace element diagrams as well as in mineral composition. However, lavas of the monogenetic cones on the southwestern slope of Kamen Volcano are similar to the moderately high-Mg basalts from Klyuchevskoy and may have been derived from the same primary melts. This means that the monogenetic cones of Kamen Volcano represent the feeding magma for Klyuchevskoy Volcano. Rocks from Kamen stratovolcano and Bezymianny form a common trend on all major element diagrams, indicating their genetic proximity. This suggests that Bezymianny Volcano inherited the feeding magma system of extinct Kamen Volcano. The observed geochemical diversity of rocks from the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes can be explained as the result of both gradual depletion over time of the mantle N-MORB-type source due to the intense previous magmatic events in this area, and the addition of distinct fluids to this mantle source.TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title Data on the geology, petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of rocks from Kamen Volcano (Central Kamchatka Depression) are presented and compared with rocks from the neighbouring active volcanoes.

Geodesy is thus a valuable tool for monitoring and hazards assessment during volcanic unrest, and it provides valuable data for exploring the geometry and volume of magma plumbing systems. Recent decades have seen an explosion in the quality and quantity of volcano geodetic data. New datasets (some made possible by regional and global scientific initiatives), as well as new analysis methods and modeling practices, have resulted in important changes to our understanding of the geodetic characteristics of active volcanism and magmatic processes, from the scale of individual eruptive vents to global compilations of volcano deformation. Here, we describe some of the recent developments in volcano geodesy, both in terms of data and interpretive tools, and discuss the role of international initiatives in meeting future challenges for the field.TITLE Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirect title Ascent of magma through Earth's crust is normally associated with, among other effects, ground deformation and gravity changes.

ScienceDirect title A detailed understanding of a volcano inner structure is one of the key-points for the volcanic hazards evaluation. To this aim, in the last decade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have been proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a function of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is possible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up to now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon tracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion planes.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique, we propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting of the Cherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after crossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is imaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to reconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the advantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title A detailed understanding of a volcano inner structure is one of the key-points for the volcanic hazards evaluation.

ScienceDirect title Vitreous basalts and plagioclase lapilli from Tolbachik Volcano studied by high-temperature gas chromatography reveal features of a fluid regime uncommon to suprasubduction melts. Prominent depletion in volatiles confirms the anomalous behavior of the Tolbachik fluid systems. Vitreous basalts contain minor amounts of water (0.16-0.27 wt.%) and carbon dioxide (95-440 ppm). New data on volatiles in the Tolbachik plagioclase lapilli show very low contents of CO2 and total gas (exclusive of H2O) and enrichment in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) relative to the basalts. In general, analysis of basalts and plagioclase lapilli from different eruptions trace a progressive increase in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) and decrease in CO2 and total gas from past to present events. The concentrations of CO2 decrease, while those of CO and CH4 in basalts and plagioclase lapilli increase systematically with an increase in FeO/MgO ratios and K2O contents in the lavas and in anorthite component in plagioclase.TITLE Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirect title Vitreous basalts and plagioclase lapilli from Tolbachik Volcano studied by high-temperature gas chromatography reveal features of a fluid regime uncommon to suprasubduction melts.

To understand the origin of the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanism, we performed geochemical analyses on the tephra deposits in the East/Japan Sea basins originating from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes. The volcanic glass in the tephra from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes ranged from alkaline trachyte to peralkaline rhyolite and from phonolite to trachyte, respectively. The tephra from the two intraplate volcanoes showed highly enriched incompatible elements, such as Tb, Nb, Hf, and Ta, distinct from those of the ordinary arc volcanoes of the Japanese islands. The straddle distribution of the Th/Yb and Ta/Yb ratios of the tephra deposits from the Baegdusan volcano may originate from the alkali basaltic magma resulting from mixing between the wet plume from the stagnant Pacific plate in the transition zone and the overlying shallow asthenospheric mantle. In contrast, the deposits from the Ulleung volcano show a minor contribution of the stagnant slab to the basaltic magma, implying either partial melting of a more enriched mantle, smaller degrees of partial melting of a garnet-bearing mantle source, or a combination of both processes as the magma genesis. Our study indicated that the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes have different magma sources and evolutionary histories.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title Trace element analyses on tephras from the Ulleung and Baegdusan (Changbai) volcanoes.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The Ulleung volcano is similar to the ordinary intraplate volcanoes.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The Baegdusan volcano resulted from both contributions of the stagnant Pacific plate and overlying asthenospheric mantle.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The intraplate Baegdusan (Changbai) and Ulleung volcanoes located on the border of China, North Korea, and East/Japan Sea, respectively, have been explained by appeals to both hotspots and asthenospheric mantle upwelling (wet plume) caused by the stagnant Pacific plate.

We show that this easily recorded type of seismicity is usually the earliest reported precursor to eruptions and show that the total energy released during this seismicity is an excellent proxy for the intruded magma volume. It is therefore extremely useful for eruption forecasting.

ScienceDirect title Two different volcanic episodes, possible single phreatomagmatic explosion.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title The Plio-Pleistocene Llancanelo volcanic field is located in the south-eastern region of the province of Mendoza, Argentina. This wide back-arc lava plateau, with hundreds of monogenetic pyroclastic cones, covers a large area behind the active Andean volcanic arc. Here we focus on the northern Llancanelo volcanic field, particularly in Las Bombas volcano. Las Bombas volcano is an eroded, but still recognizable, scoria cone located in a circular depression surrounded by a basaltic lava flow, suggesting that Las Bombas volcano was there when the lava flow field formed and, therefore, the lava flow engulfed it completely. While this explanation seems reasonable, the common presence of similar landforms in this part of the field justifies the need to establish correctly the stratigraphic relationship between lava flow fields and these circular depressions. The main purpose of this research is to investigate Las Bombas volcano 3D subsurface architecture by means of geophysical methods. We carried out a paleomagnetic study and detailed topographic, magnetic and gravimetric land surveys. Magnetic anomalies of normal and reverse polarity and paleomagnetic results point to the occurrence of two different volcanic episodes. A circular low Bouguer anomaly was detected beneath Las Bombas scoria cone indicating the existence of a mass deficit. A 3D forward gravity model was constructed, which suggests that the mass deficit would be related to the presence of fracture zones below Las Bombas volcano cone, due to sudden degassing of younger magma beneath it, or to a single phreatomagmatic explosion.

Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-year-long thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system. This provides a remarkable support for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting, particularly in remote areas where permanent ground data acquisition is hazardous, expensive and difficult.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title On October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title MIROVA system detected one-year long thermal anomalies preceding the explosion.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title Space-based thermal flux was associated to the high-temperature fumaroles field.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title We tracked the Santa Ana activity from volcanic unrest to the crater lake activity.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title On October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano (El Salvador) underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption after approximately one century of rest. Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-year-long thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system.

ScienceDirect title In this paper we propose an automatic volcano event detection system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with state and event duration models. Since different volcanic events have different durations, therefore the state and whole event durations learnt from the training data are enforced on the corresponding state and event duration models within the HMM. Seismic signals from the Llaima volcano are used to train the system. Two types of events are employed in this study, Long Period (LP) and Volcano-Tectonic (VT). Experiments show that the standard HMMs can detect the volcano events with high accuracy but generates false positives. The results presented in this paper show that the incorporation of duration modeling can lead to reductions in false positive rate in event detection as high as 31% with a true positive accuracy equal to 94%. Further evaluation of the false positives indicate that the false alarms generated by the system were mostly potential events based on the signal-to-noise ratio criteria recommended by a volcano expert.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Sohail Masood is now with the Department of Computer Science, University of Lahore, Gujrat Campus, Pakistan.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Salman Khan is now with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar, Pakistan.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Volcano event durations are modeled in the HMM framework.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title State duration are modeling with max and min bounds.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Event duration are modeled with max and min bounds and with a gamma distribution.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title New event penalization is incorporated to reduce false positives.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title In this paper we propose an automatic volcano event detection system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with state and event duration models.

To understand the origin of the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanism, we performed geochemical analyses on the tephra deposits in the East/Japan Sea basins originating from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes. The volcanic glass in the tephra from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes ranged from alkaline trachyte to peralkaline rhyolite and from phonolite to trachyte, respectively. The tephra from the two intraplate volcanoes showed highly enriched incompatible elements, such as Tb, Nb, Hf, and Ta, distinct from those of the ordinary arc volcanoes of the Japanese islands. The straddle distribution of the Th/Yb and Ta/Yb ratios of the tephra deposits from the Baegdusan volcano may originate from the alkali basaltic magma resulting from mixing between the wet plume from the stagnant Pacific plate in the transition zone and the overlying shallow asthenospheric mantle. In contrast, the deposits from the Ulleung volcano show a minor contribution of the stagnant slab to the basaltic magma, implying either partial melting of a more enriched mantle, smaller degrees of partial melting of a garnet-bearing mantle source, or a combination of both processes as the magma genesis. Our study indicated that the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes have different magma sources and evolutionary histories.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title Trace element analyses on tephras from the Ulleung and Baegdusan (Changbai) volcanoes.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The Ulleung volcano is similar to the ordinary intraplate volcanoes.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The Baegdusan volcano resulted from both contributions of the stagnant Pacific plate and overlying asthenospheric mantle.TITLE Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The intraplate Baegdusan (Changbai) and Ulleung volcanoes located on the border of China, North Korea, and East/Japan Sea, respectively, have been explained by appeals to both hotspots and asthenospheric mantle upwelling (wet plume) caused by the stagnant Pacific plate.

ScienceDirect title TITLE Review of ten years of volcano deformations recorded by the ground-based InSAR monitoring system at Stromboli volcano: a tool to mitigate volcano flank dynamics and intense volcanic activity - ScienceDirect title Stromboli volcano (Southern Italy) is one of the most monitored volcano in the world with a surveillance network that includes a permanently sited ground-based SAR interferometer (GBInSAR). This work is the review of the GBInSAR data gained from the last decade of monitoring activity. The analysis of the entire dataset of GBInSAR measurements allowed the assessment of the deformation field of the northern part of the summit crater area and the Sciara del Fuoco depression. In detail, the main displacements recognized can be related to different factors: 1) the inflation/deflation respectively immediately before and after each new effusive event; 2) the bulging of localized sectors of the volcano involved in the vent opening; 3) the gravitational sliding of the Sciara del Fuoco infill; 4) the movement of lava flows. Accelerations in this sector are related to sheet intrusions, while the possibility of vent opening, associated with small sliding, or catastrophic flank failure are related to highly overpressurized sheets, able to produce high displacement rate in the Sciara del Fuoco.TITLE Review of ten years of volcano deformations recorded by the ground-based InSAR monitoring system at Stromboli volcano: a tool to mitigate volcano flank dynamics and intense volcanic activity - ScienceDirect title In the summit crater area, the increases in the displacement rate are related to the pressurization of the shallow conduit system, as the consequence of the variation in the magma level (magmastatic pressure) or to the lateral magma migration (lateral conduit expansion or dike intrusion) in response to the increase of the overpressure component. Fluctuations in the displacement rate in the summit crater area can be related to the magma overturning within the conduit, with the increases in displacement rate during the upwelling of less dense magma, while displacement rate decreases as the degassed magma column is pushed out from the conduit (lava flows or overflows). Instead, the decrease in the displacement rate without coeval lava outpouring could be related to the sink of the degassed magma due to density contrast between the gas-poor and the gas-charged magmas. Using the displacement rate in the summit crater area as a proxy for the variation in the pressure condition in conduit (both magmastatic and overpressure components), thresholds for the crises characterized by the occurrence of overflows (eventually associated with major explosions) and flank effusions (eventually associated with paroxysmal explosions) are identified. Small conduit overpressure will produce overflows (sometimes associated with crater-rim collapses), while large magma overpressure will laterally expand the conduit forming NE-SW striking sheets, feeding eruptive vents at the base of the summit crater area and within the Sciara del Fuoco, generating conditions of instability that can evolve into catastrophic collapse of the instable flank.TITLE Magma source beneath the Bezymianny volcano and its interconnection with Klyuchevskoy inferred from local earthquake seismic tomography -

ScienceDirect title Magma is transported and stored in the crust mostly through networks of planar structures (intrusive sheets), ranging from vertical dykes to inclined sheets and horizontal sills, and magma chambers, which make up the plumbing system of volcanoes. This study presents an overview of plumbing systems imaged at different depths and geodynamic settings, in order to contribute to assessing the factors that control their geometry. Data were derived from personal field surveys and through the analysis of publications; observations include local lithology and tectonics of the host rock with special reference to local fault kinematics and related stress tensor, regional tectonics (general kinematics and far-field stress tensors), geology and shape of the volcano, topographic settings, and structural and petrochemical characteristics of the plumbing system. Information from active volcanoes and eroded extinct volcanoes is discussed; the shallow plumbing system of active volcanoes has been reconstructed by combining available geophysical data with field information derived from outcropping sheets, morphometric analyses of pyroclastic cones, and the orientation and location of eruptive fissures. The study of eroded volcanoes enabled to assess the plumbing system geometry at deeper levels in the core of the edifice or underneath the volcano-substratum interface. Key sites are presented in extensional, transcurrent and contractional tectonic settings from North and South-America, Iceland, the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea and Africa. The types of sheet arrangements illustrated include swarms of parallel dykes, diverging rift patterns, centrally-inclined sheets, ring and radial dykes, circum-lateral collapse sheets, sills, and mixed members. This review shows that intrusive sheet emplacement at a volcano depends upon the combination of several local and regional factors, some of which are difficult to be constrained. While much progress has been made, it is still very challenging to forecast the likely paths and geometry of sheet propagation and emplacement during volcanic unrest events.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title Volcano plumbing systems are reviewed at different depths and geodynamic settings.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title Intact cones and volcanoes with lateral failure and caldera collapse are analysed.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title Magma chambers, sills, dykes and inclined sheets are described.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title The structure of plumbing systems depends on several local and regional parameters.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title Magma and tectonic stresses, topography, host rock, and magma characters are analysed.TITLE Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirect title Magma is transported and stored in the crust mostly through networks of planar structures (intrusive sheets), ranging from vertical dykes to inclined sheets and horizontal sills, and magma chambers, which make up the plumbing system of volcanoes.

This wide back-arc lava plateau, with hundreds of monogenetic pyroclastic cones, covers a large area behind the active Andean volcanic arc. Here we focus on the northern Llancanelo volcanic field, particularly in Las Bombas volcano. Las Bombas volcano is an eroded, but still recognizable, scoria cone located in a circular depression surrounded by a basaltic lava flow, suggesting that Las Bombas volcano was there when the lava flow field formed and, therefore, the lava flow engulfed it completely. While this explanation seems reasonable, the common presence of similar landforms in this part of the field justifies the need to establish correctly the stratigraphic relationship between lava flow fields and these circular depressions. The main purpose of this research is to investigate Las Bombas volcano 3D subsurface architecture by means of geophysical methods. We carried out a paleomagnetic study and detailed topographic, magnetic and gravimetric land surveys. Magnetic anomalies of normal and reverse polarity and paleomagnetic results point to the occurrence of two different volcanic episodes. A circular low Bouguer anomaly was detected beneath Las Bombas scoria cone indicating the existence of a mass deficit. A 3D forward gravity model was constructed, which suggests that the mass deficit would be related to the presence of fracture zones below Las Bombas volcano cone, due to sudden degassing of younger magma beneath it, or to a single phreatomagmatic explosion. Our results provide new and detailed information about Las Bombas volcano subsurface architecture.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title Northern Llancanelo volcanic field (Mendoza, Argentina) Las Bombas (LB) volcano.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title LB is located in a circular depression surrounded by basaltic lava flows.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title Investigation of LB 3D subsurface architecture by means of geophysical methods.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title Paleomagnetic study, topographic, magnetic and gravity land surveys, 3D modeling.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title Two different volcanic episodes, possible single phreatomagmatic explosion.TITLE Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirect title The Plio-Pleistocene Llancanelo volcanic field is located in the south-eastern region of the province of Mendoza, Argentina.

ScienceDirect title We tracked the Santa Ana activity from volcanic unrest to the crater lake activity.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title On October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano (El Salvador) underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption after approximately one century of rest. Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-year-long thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system. This provides a remarkable support for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting, particularly in remote areas where permanent ground data acquisition is hazardous, expensive and difficult.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title On October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title MIROVA system detected one-year long thermal anomalies preceding the explosion.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title Space-based thermal flux was associated to the high-temperature fumaroles field.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title We tracked the Santa Ana activity from volcanic unrest to the crater lake activity.TITLE Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirect title On October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano (El Salvador) underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption after approximately one century of rest.

ScienceDirect title In this paper we propose an automatic volcano event detection system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with state and event duration models. Since different volcanic events have different durations, therefore the state and whole event durations learnt from the training data are enforced on the corresponding state and event duration models within the HMM. Seismic signals from the Llaima volcano are used to train the system. Two types of events are employed in this study, Long Period (LP) and Volcano-Tectonic (VT). Experiments show that the standard HMMs can detect the volcano events with high accuracy but generates false positives. The results presented in this paper show that the incorporation of duration modeling can lead to reductions in false positive rate in event detection as high as 31% with a true positive accuracy equal to 94%. Further evaluation of the false positives indicate that the false alarms generated by the system were mostly potential events based on the signal-to-noise ratio criteria recommended by a volcano expert.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Sohail Masood is now with the Department of Computer Science, University of Lahore, Gujrat Campus, Pakistan.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Salman Khan is now with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar, Pakistan.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Volcano event durations are modeled in the HMM framework.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title State duration are modeling with max and min bounds.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title Event duration are modeled with max and min bounds and with a gamma distribution.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title New event penalization is incorporated to reduce false positives.TITLE Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirect title In this paper we propose an automatic volcano event detection system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with state and event duration models.

ScienceDirect title In this study we show 2D intrinsic- and scattering-Q images of Asama volcano obtained by analyzing 2320 waveforms from active data. Observed energy envelopes were fitted to the diffusion model and separate intrinsic- and scattering-Q images were produced using a back-projection method based on a Gaussian-type weighting function. Synthetic tests indicate robustness and reliability of the results. Areas of high scattering attenuation coincide with the volcanic edifice and the summit at which recent eruptions took place. The intrinsic dissipation pattern shows a strong contrast between the east and west side of the volcanic structure with the low values observed in the west interpreted as solidified magma bodies. Our results demonstrate a strong relationship between structural heterogeneities and attenuation processes in volcanic areas and confirm the effectiveness of the present technique, which can be used as an imaging tool complementary to conventional techniques.TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title Separation of Qi and Qs in volcanic regionsTITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title We applied diffusion approximation to obtain attenuation coefficients.TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title We applied Gaussian-type weighting function to obtain attenuation distributions.TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title We separately obtained 2D intrinsic-Q and scattering-Q images of Asama volcano.TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title We demonstrate the relationship between volcanic features and attenuation processes.TITLE Separation of scattering and intrinsic attenuation at Asama volcano (Japan): Evidence of high volcanic structural contrasts - ScienceDirect title In this study we show 2D intrinsic- and scattering-Q images of Asama volcano obtained by analyzing 2320 waveforms from active data.

ScienceDirect title A key question for volcanic hazard assessment is the extent to which information can be exchanged between volcanoes. This question is particularly pertinent to hazard forecasting for dome-building volcanoes, where effusive activity may persist for years to decades, and may be punctuated by periods of repose, and sudden explosive activity. Here we review historical eruptive activity of fifteen lava dome-building volcanoes over the past two centuries, with the goal of creating a hierarchy of exchangeable (i.e., similar) behaviours. Eruptive behaviour is classified using empirical observations that include patterns of SO2 flux, eruption style, and magma composition. We identify two eruptive regimes: (i) an episodic regime where eruptions are much shorter than intervening periods of repose, and degassing is temporally correlated with lava effusion; and (ii) a persistent regime where eruptions are comparable in length to periods of repose and gas emissions do not correlate with eruption rates. A corollary to these two eruptive regimes is that there are also two different types of repose: (i) inter-eruptive repose separates episodic eruptions, and is characterised by negligible gas emissions and (ii) intra-eruptive repose is observed in persistently active volcanoes, and is characterised by continuous gas emissions. We suggest that these different patterns of can be used to infer vertical connectivity within mush-dominated magmatic systems. We also note that our recognition of two different types of repose raises questions about traditional definitions of historical volcanism as a point process. This is important, because the ontology of eruptive activity (that is, the definition of volcanic activity in time) influences both analysis of volcanic data and, by extension, interpretations of magmatic processes. Our analysis suggests that one identifying exchangeable traits or behaviours provides a starting point for developing robust ontologies of volcanic activity. Moreover, by linking eruptive regimes to conceptual models of magmatic processes, we illustrate a path towards developing a conceptual framework not only for comparing data between different volcanoes but also for improving forecasts of eruptive activity.TITLE Similarities and differences in the historical records of lava dome-building volcanoes: Implications for understanding magmatic processes and eruption forecasting - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Similarities and differences in the historical records of lava dome-building volcanoes: Implications for understanding magmatic processes and eruption forecasting - ScienceDirect title A key question for volcanic hazard assessment is the extent to which information can be exchanged between volcanoes.

Volcano infrasound is effective for tracking and quantifying eruptive phenomena because it corresponds to activity occurring near and around the volcanic vent, as opposed to seismic signals, which are generated by both surface and internal volcanic processes. As with seismology, infrasound can be recorded remotely, during inclement weather, or in the dark to provide a continuous record of a volcano's unrest. Moreover, it can also be exploited at regional or global distances, where seismic monitoring has limited efficacy. This paper provides a literature overview of the current state of the field and summarizes applications of infrasound as a tool for better understanding volcanic activity. Many infrasound studies have focused on integration with other geophysical data, including seismic, thermal, electromagnetic radiation, and gas spectroscopy and they have generally improved our understanding of eruption dynamics. Other work has incorporated infrasound into volcano surveillance to enhance capabilities for monitoring hazardous volcanoes and reducing risk. This paper aims to provide an overview of volcano airwave studies (from analog microbarometer to modern pressure transducer) and summarizes how infrasound is currently used to infer eruption dynamics. It also outlines the relative merits of local and regional infrasound surveillance, highlights differences between array and network sensor topologies, and concludes with mention of sensor technologies appropriate for volcano infrasound study.TITLE Volcano infrasound: A review - ScienceDirect title TITLE Volcano infrasound: A review - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcano infrasound: A review - ScienceDirect title Exploding volcanoes, which produce intense infrasound, are reminiscent of the veritable explosion of volcano infrasound papers published during the last decade.

Various tests performed have shown limitations of the spatial resolution of the model and provided arguments for the reliability of the major structures used in the interpretation. In the uppermost layer down to 20 km depth, the model reveals strong low-velocity anomalies coinciding with Holocene volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group and Kizimen. In the seismogenic zone at depths from 80 to 150 km, we observe a low-velocity anomaly, which probably reflects the presence of the relatively thick oceanic crust sinking together with the subducting slab. This anomaly may also represent a zone of phase transitions, melting, and release of fluids from the slab. In the cross sections, we observe vertical and inclined low-velocity anomalies connecting the slab with the volcanic groups that probably represent the paths of ascending fluids and melts, which feed the volcanoes. In the case of Kizimen, we observe a single conduit connecting the volcano with the slab transformation area at 100 km depth. Beneath the Klyuchevskoy group, we identify several linear inclined patterns having different dipping angles. This may show that the volcanoes of the group are fed from different segments of the slab and might be one of the reasons for the diversity of lava compositions in the volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group.TITLE Magma sources in the mantle wedge beneath the volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group and Kizimen based on seismic tomography modeling - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Magma sources in the mantle wedge beneath the volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group and Kizimen based on seismic tomography modeling - ScienceDirect title This study presents a 3D model of the P and S seismic velocities above the Kamchatkan slab obtained as a result of tomographic inversion of arrival times of body waves from deep seismicity in the subduction zone.

In the past two decades, the development of density functional theory (DFT) and surface kinetics make it feasible to theoretically evaluate and predict the catalytic activity variation of catalysts within a descriptor-based framework. Thereinto, the concept of the volcano curve, which reveals the general activity trend, usually constitutes the basic foundation of catalyst screening. However, although it is a widely accepted concept in heterogeneous catalysis, its origin lacks a clear physical picture and definite interpretation. Herein, starting with a brief review of the development of the catalyst screening framework, we use a two-step kinetic model to refine and clarify the origin of the volcano curve with a full analytical analysis by integrating the surface kinetics and the results of first-principles calculations. It is mathematically demonstrated that the volcano curve is an essential property in catalysis, which results from the self-poisoning effect accompanying the catalytic adsorption process. Specifically, when adsorption is strong, it is the rapid decrease of surface free sites rather than the augmentation of energy barriers that inhibits the overall reaction rate and results in the volcano curve. Some interesting points and implications in assisting catalyst screening are also discussed based on the kinetic derivation. Moreover, recent applications of the volcano curve for catalyst design in two important photoelectrocatalytic processes (the hydrogen evolution reaction and dye-sensitized solar cells) are also briefly discussed.TITLE Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirect title A self-consistent mathematic elucidation of the origin of volcano curve was conducted by a two-step kinetic model analytically, and some interesting guidelines for catalyst design are discussed during our derivation.TITLE Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirect title Haifeng Wang(East China University of Science and Technology)received the Rising Star Award in 2014, which was presented by The Catalysis Society of China.

The calculated equilibrium temperatures for quartz, anhydrite and alunite were helpful in understanding the state of the hydrothermal systems in the area. Although the measured water temperatures of the hot springs at their vents have decreased gradually since the 1970s, the temperatures of the geothermal systems in the area do not seem to be in a downward trend based on the geothermometry. The temperatures of the geothermal systems have probably fluctuated in response to changes in the volcanic activity of the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. The changes in the estimated equilibrium temperatures for appropriate minerals give us helpful information on the volcanic activity that we can-not obtain directly, by monitoring of water chemistry of hot springs in the volcanic area.TITLE Chemical Geothermometry Studies on a Geothermal System in Manza Hot Springs Near Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano, Japan - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of WRI-15.TITLE Physical Properties and Mineral Content of Sidoarjo Mud Volcano - ScienceDirect title Laboratory tests were conducted to assess the physical properties and mineral content of Sidoarjo mud volcano (or known as Lusi). These information are used to estimate the compression index which is considered to be important to support the reclamation program of the impoundment area. Physical properties of Lusi such as particle size distribution, Atterberg limits and specific gravity were determined in laboratory. Mineral content was observed through XRD test. Based on the Atterberg limit, the compression index was determined. The mineral content observed from the test are Chlorite and Illite. The results show that Lusi material consist of mostly fine-grained soil about 84.47% which dominated by clay size particle about 54.47% of total dry weight. Based on USCS it is classified as high plasticity silt (MH). New correlation has been proposed to estimate compression index from liquid limit and plasticity index using available data in literature. This new approach uses A-line in plasticity chart as boundary to database for developing the equations. Based on this separation of databases, more precise equations are obtained indicated by higher R value. Compression index of Lusi mud volcano is 0.367 from liquid limit-based calculation and is 0.454 from plasticity index-based calculation.TITLE Physical Properties and Mineral Content of Sidoarjo Mud Volcano - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of organizing committee of The 5th International Conference of Euro Asia Civil Engineering Forum (EACEF-5).TITLE Volcanoes and muons - ScienceDirect title A review of muon radiography of volcanoes is presented.TITLE Volcanoes and muons - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcanoes and muons - ScienceDirect title A review of muon radiography of volcanoes is presented.TITLE Volcanoes and muons - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Bottom currents and their influence on the sedimentation pattern in the El Arraiche mud volcano province, southern Gulf of Cadiz - ScienceDirect title TITLE Bottom currents and their influence on the sedimentation pattern in the El Arraiche mud volcano province, southern Gulf of Cadiz - ScienceDirect title Internal tides create contourite deposits along mud volcanoes.TITLE Bottom currents and their influence on the sedimentation pattern in the El Arraiche mud volcano province, southern Gulf of Cadiz - ScienceDirect title TITLE Bottom currents and their influence on the sedimentation pattern in the El Arraiche mud volcano province, southern Gulf of Cadiz - ScienceDirect title AAIW and NACW are deflected by the Renard Ridge and flow along it afterwards.TITLE Bottom currents and their influence on the sedimentation pattern in the El Arraiche mud volcano province, southern Gulf of Cadiz - ScienceDirect title Steep slopes induce contourite deposits along the Renard Ridge.TITLE Bottom currents and their influence on the sedimentation pattern in the El Arraiche mud volcano province, southern Gulf of Cadiz - ScienceDirect title The completion of IODP expedition 339 within the Cadiz contourite depositional system, along the southern Iberian margin (which was created and maintained by the Mediterranean Outflow Water) has brought increased amounts of attention to this natural contourite laboratory.

ScienceDirect title Strategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Tilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Pressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Decrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Shear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Strategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity.

In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (483KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Tagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title TdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Fe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice.

ScienceDirect title In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title Two groups of mixed sporopollen assemblage were classified by color in Dushanzi mud volcano ejecta.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title The main composition of light color group may be mainly derived from the Miocene strata.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title The darker color group might be from the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic strata.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title Dushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records.

Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirect title Among the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body.

ScienceDirect title The Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Dacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Volcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title In order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Now at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Andesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title The heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title The Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Dacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Volcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts.

Geodesy is thus a valuable tool for monitoring and hazards assessment during volcanic unrest, and it provides valuable data for exploring the geometry and volume of magma plumbing systems. Recent decades have seen an explosion in the quality and quantity of volcano geodetic data. New datasets (some made possible by regional and global scientific initiatives), as well as new analysis methods and modeling practices, have resulted in important changes to our understanding of the geodetic characteristics of active volcanism and magmatic processes, from the scale of individual eruptive vents to global compilations of volcano deformation. Here, we describe some of the recent developments in volcano geodesy, both in terms of data and interpretive tools, and discuss the role of international initiatives in meeting future challenges for the field.TITLE Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirect title Ascent of magma through Earth's crust is normally associated with, among other effects, ground deformation and gravity changes.

The rocks from Kamen and Ploskie Sopky volcanoes differ systematically in major elemental and mineral compositions and could not have been produced from the same primary melts. The compositional trends of Kamen stratovolcano lavas and dikes are clearly distinct from those of Klyuchevskoy lavas in all major and trace element diagrams as well as in mineral composition. However, lavas of the monogenetic cones on the southwestern slope of Kamen Volcano are similar to the moderately high-Mg basalts from Klyuchevskoy and may have been derived from the same primary melts. This means that the monogenetic cones of Kamen Volcano represent the feeding magma for Klyuchevskoy Volcano. Rocks from Kamen stratovolcano and Bezymianny form a common trend on all major element diagrams, indicating their genetic proximity. This suggests that Bezymianny Volcano inherited the feeding magma system of extinct Kamen Volcano. The observed geochemical diversity of rocks from the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes can be explained as the result of both gradual depletion over time of the mantle N-MORB-type source due to the intense previous magmatic events in this area, and the addition of distinct fluids to this mantle source.TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title Data on the geology, petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of rocks from Kamen Volcano (Central Kamchatka Depression) are presented and compared with rocks from the neighbouring active volcanoes.

ScienceDirect title TITLE Intra-arc and back-arc volcano-tectonics: Magma pathways at Holocene Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The reconstruction of magma pathways at active volcanoes is of paramount importance for the comprehension of their structure and for geohazard assessment. Magma plumbing systems at volcanic arcs may be particularly complicated since the magma rises along fractures that can be consistent with the coeval regional state of stress, the local state of stress, or can form dykes that instead follow pre-existing structures. Magma path orientation can be stable over time or can vary as the consequence of external events like large earthquakes or important modifications in volcano morphology. In order to advance understanding of these issues, we reviewed all available information on the Holocene volcano-tectonics of the Alaska-Aleutian arc and back-arc zones, based on published seismological, interferometric and geological-structural data, geological maps, and official reports. We completed our review with some new measurements of Holocene eruptive fissures, faults, dykes, and morphometric characteristics of pyroclastic cones and volcanic domes aimed at better defining the possible shallow magma paths of the recent-active volcanoes. Finally, we reviewed the possible parameters and models that explain the path configurations. At 32 volcanoes, magma paths strike NW-SE, perpendicular or oblique to the arc but parallel to the regional greatest principal stress. At 20 volcanoes magma paths are parallel to the arc, and 19 volcanoes form rows of coalescent cones that also suggest ascent of magma parallel to the arc. Eight volcanoes display both directions (normal and parallel to the arc), and seismological data indicate that at some volcanoes there has been a rotation of the magma pathway over time. Integration of all data shows that the regional ambient tectonic stress field promotes dyke intrusions normal to the trench. Dykes can also intrude parallel to the trench following stress unclamping from large earthquakes. Trench-parallel dykes and rows of volcanoes can be generated by magma batches that are aligned parallel to the trend of the subduction zone. Once a dyke or a sill is intruded, it locally perturbs the stress field facilitating successive intrusion along a perpendicular direction.TITLE Intra-arc and back-arc volcano-tectonics: Magma pathways at Holocene Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Intra-arc and back-arc volcano-tectonics: Magma pathways at Holocene Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The reconstruction of magma pathways at active volcanoes is of paramount importance for the comprehension of their structure and for geohazard assessment.

ScienceDirect title The shallow magma bodies at Erta Ale are oriented according to stresses induced by edifice loading.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Understanding the magmatic systems beneath rift volcanoes provides insights into the deeper processes associated with rift architecture and development. At the slow spreading Erta Ale segment (Afar, Ethiopia) transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading is ongoing on land. A lava lake has been documented since the twentieth century at the summit of the Erta Ale volcano and acts as an indicator of the pressure of its magma reservoir. However, the structure of the plumbing system of the volcano feeding such persistent active lava lake and the mechanisms controlling the architecture of magma storage remain unclear. Here, we combine high-resolution satellite optical imagery and radar interferometry (InSAR) to infer the shape, location and orientation of the conduits feeding the 2017 Erta Ale eruption. We show that the lava lake was rooted in a vertical dike-shaped reservoir that had been inflating prior to the eruption. The magma was subsequently transferred into a shallower feeder dike. We also find a shallow, horizontal magma lens elongated along axis inflating beneath the volcano during the later period of the eruption. Edifice stress modeling suggests the hydraulically connected system of horizontal and vertical thin magmatic bodies able to open and close are arranged spatially according to stresses induced by loading and unloading due to topographic changes. Our combined approach may provide new constraints on the organization of magma plumbing systems beneath volcanoes in continental and marine settings.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Slow accumulation in a dike-shaped reservoir is observed beneath Erta Ale volcano prior to the eruption.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Co-eruption deformation is explained with hydraulically connected shallow dikes and a horizontal axial sill.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title The shallow magma bodies at Erta Ale are oriented according to stresses induced by edifice loading.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Understanding the magmatic systems beneath rift volcanoes provides insights into the deeper processes associated with rift architecture and development.

To this aim, in the last decade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have been proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a function of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is possible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up to now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon tracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion planes.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique, we propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting of the Cherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after crossing the volcano.

ScienceDirect title Despite its potential, time-variable volcano gravimetry is an underexploited method, not widely adopted by volcano researchers or observatories. The cost of instrumentation and the difficulty in using it under harsh environmental conditions is a significant impediment to the exploitation of gravimetry at many volcanoes. In addition, retrieving useful information from gravity changes in noisy volcanic environments is a major challenge. While these difficulties are not trivial, neither are they insurmountable; indeed, creative efforts in a variety of volcanic settings highlight the value of time-variable gravimetry for understanding hazards as well as revealing fundamental insights into how volcanoes work.TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title Building on previous work, we provide a comprehensive review of time-variable volcano gravimetry, including discussions of instrumentation, modeling and analysis techniques, and case studies that emphasize what can be learned from campaign, continuous, and hybrid gravity observations. We are hopeful that this exploration of time-variable volcano gravimetry will excite more scientists about the potential of the method, spurring further application, development, and innovation.TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title Despite its potential, time-variable volcano gravimetry is an underexploited method, not widely adopted by volcano researchers or observatories.

ScienceDirect title Fluids discharged from volcanic systems are the direct surface manifestation of magma degassing at depth and provide primary insights for evaluating the state of volcanic activity. We review the geochemical best practice in volcanic surveillance based to a huge amount of monitoring data collected at different active volcanoes using both continuous and discontinuous approaches. The targeted volcanoes belong to the Aeolian Arc located in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), and they have exhibited different activity states during the monitoring activities reported here. La Fossa cone on Vulcano Island has been in an uninterrupted quiescent stage characterized by variable solfataric activity. In contrast, Stromboli Island has shown a persistent mild explosive activity, episodically interrupted by effusive eruptions (in 1985, 2002, 2007, and 2014). Panarea Island, which is the summit of a seamount rising from the seafloor of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, showed only undersea fluid release. The only observable clues of active volcanism at Panarea Island have been impulsive changes in the undersea fluid release, with the last submarine gas burst event being observed in November 2002. The geochemical monitoring and observations at each of these volcanoes has directly involved the volcanic plume and/or the fumarole vents, thermal waters, and diffuse soil degassing, depending on the type of manifestations and the level of activity encountered. Through direct access to the magmatic samples (when possible) and the collection of as much observable data related to the fluid release as possible, the aim has been (i) to verify the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, (ii) to discern among the possible hydrothermal, magmatic, marine, and meteoric sources in the fluid mixtures, (iii) to develop models of the fluid circulation supported by data, (iv) to follow the evolution of these natural systems by long-term monitoring, and (v) to support surveillance actions related to defining the volcanic risk and the evaluation and possible mitigation of related hazards. The examples provided in this review article show the close relationships among data analysis, interpretation, and modeling. We particularly focus on describing the fieldwork procedures, since any theoretical approach must always be verified and supported by field data, rather than just by experiments controlled in laboratory. Indeed the natural systems involve many variables producing effects that cannot be neglected. The monitored volcanic systems have been regarded as natural laboratories, and all of the activities have focused on both volcanological research and surveillance purposes in order to ensure that these two goals have overlapped. An appendix is also included that explains the scientific approach to the systematic activities, regarding geochemical monitoring of volcanic activity.TITLE Review of the evolution of geochemical monitoring, networks and methodologies applied to the volcanoes of the Aeolian Arc (Italy) - ScienceDirect title Fluids discharged from volcanic systems are the direct surface manifestation of magma degassing at depth and provide primary insights for evaluating the state of volcanic activity.

ScienceDirect title Vitreous basalts and plagioclase lapilli from Tolbachik Volcano studied by high-temperature gas chromatography reveal features of a fluid regime uncommon to suprasubduction melts. Prominent depletion in volatiles confirms the anomalous behavior of the Tolbachik fluid systems. Vitreous basalts contain minor amounts of water (0.16-0.27 wt.%) and carbon dioxide (95-440 ppm). New data on volatiles in the Tolbachik plagioclase lapilli show very low contents of CO2 and total gas (exclusive of H2O) and enrichment in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) relative to the basalts. In general, analysis of basalts and plagioclase lapilli from different eruptions trace a progressive increase in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) and decrease in CO2 and total gas from past to present events. The concentrations of CO2 decrease, while those of CO and CH4 in basalts and plagioclase lapilli increase systematically with an increase in FeO/MgO ratios and K2O contents in the lavas and in anorthite component in plagioclase.TITLE Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirect title Vitreous basalts and plagioclase lapilli from Tolbachik Volcano studied by high-temperature gas chromatography reveal features of a fluid regime uncommon to suprasubduction melts.

Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis.

ScienceDirect title Strategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Tilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Pressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Decrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Shear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Strategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity.

In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (483KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Tagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title TdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title Fe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirect title The eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice.

ScienceDirect title In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title Two groups of mixed sporopollen assemblage were classified by color in Dushanzi mud volcano ejecta.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title The main composition of light color group may be mainly derived from the Miocene strata.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title The darker color group might be from the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic strata.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title Dushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirect title In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records.

Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirect title Among the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body.

It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title In order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Now at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Andesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title The heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title The Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Dacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirect title Volcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts.

The rocks from Kamen and Ploskie Sopky volcanoes differ systematically in major elemental and mineral compositions and could not have been produced from the same primary melts. The compositional trends of Kamen stratovolcano lavas and dikes are clearly distinct from those of Klyuchevskoy lavas in all major and trace element diagrams as well as in mineral composition. However, lavas of the monogenetic cones on the southwestern slope of Kamen Volcano are similar to the moderately high-Mg basalts from Klyuchevskoy and may have been derived from the same primary melts. This means that the monogenetic cones of Kamen Volcano represent the feeding magma for Klyuchevskoy Volcano. Rocks from Kamen stratovolcano and Bezymianny form a common trend on all major element diagrams, indicating their genetic proximity. This suggests that Bezymianny Volcano inherited the feeding magma system of extinct Kamen Volcano. The observed geochemical diversity of rocks from the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes can be explained as the result of both gradual depletion over time of the mantle N-MORB-type source due to the intense previous magmatic events in this area, and the addition of distinct fluids to this mantle source.TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirect title Data on the geology, petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of rocks from Kamen Volcano (Central Kamchatka Depression) are presented and compared with rocks from the neighbouring active volcanoes.

Geodesy is thus a valuable tool for monitoring and hazards assessment during volcanic unrest, and it provides valuable data for exploring the geometry and volume of magma plumbing systems. Recent decades have seen an explosion in the quality and quantity of volcano geodetic data. New datasets (some made possible by regional and global scientific initiatives), as well as new analysis methods and modeling practices, have resulted in important changes to our understanding of the geodetic characteristics of active volcanism and magmatic processes, from the scale of individual eruptive vents to global compilations of volcano deformation. Here, we describe some of the recent developments in volcano geodesy, both in terms of data and interpretive tools, and discuss the role of international initiatives in meeting future challenges for the field.TITLE Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirect title Ascent of magma through Earth's crust is normally associated with, among other effects, ground deformation and gravity changes.

ScienceDirect title The reconstruction of magma pathways at active volcanoes is of paramount importance for the comprehension of their structure and for geohazard assessment. Magma plumbing systems at volcanic arcs may be particularly complicated since the magma rises along fractures that can be consistent with the coeval regional state of stress, the local state of stress, or can form dykes that instead follow pre-existing structures. Magma path orientation can be stable over time or can vary as the consequence of external events like large earthquakes or important modifications in volcano morphology. In order to advance understanding of these issues, we reviewed all available information on the Holocene volcano-tectonics of the Alaska-Aleutian arc and back-arc zones, based on published seismological, interferometric and geological-structural data, geological maps, and official reports. We completed our review with some new measurements of Holocene eruptive fissures, faults, dykes, and morphometric characteristics of pyroclastic cones and volcanic domes aimed at better defining the possible shallow magma paths of the recent-active volcanoes. Finally, we reviewed the possible parameters and models that explain the path configurations. At 32 volcanoes, magma paths strike NW-SE, perpendicular or oblique to the arc but parallel to the regional greatest principal stress. At 20 volcanoes magma paths are parallel to the arc, and 19 volcanoes form rows of coalescent cones that also suggest ascent of magma parallel to the arc. Eight volcanoes display both directions (normal and parallel to the arc), and seismological data indicate that at some volcanoes there has been a rotation of the magma pathway over time. Integration of all data shows that the regional ambient tectonic stress field promotes dyke intrusions normal to the trench. Dykes can also intrude parallel to the trench following stress unclamping from large earthquakes. Trench-parallel dykes and rows of volcanoes can be generated by magma batches that are aligned parallel to the trend of the subduction zone. Once a dyke or a sill is intruded, it locally perturbs the stress field facilitating successive intrusion along a perpendicular direction.TITLE Intra-arc and back-arc volcano-tectonics: Magma pathways at Holocene Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Intra-arc and back-arc volcano-tectonics: Magma pathways at Holocene Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes - ScienceDirect title The reconstruction of magma pathways at active volcanoes is of paramount importance for the comprehension of their structure and for geohazard assessment.

ScienceDirect title Understanding the magmatic systems beneath rift volcanoes provides insights into the deeper processes associated with rift architecture and development. At the slow spreading Erta Ale segment (Afar, Ethiopia) transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading is ongoing on land. A lava lake has been documented since the twentieth century at the summit of the Erta Ale volcano and acts as an indicator of the pressure of its magma reservoir. However, the structure of the plumbing system of the volcano feeding such persistent active lava lake and the mechanisms controlling the architecture of magma storage remain unclear. Here, we combine high-resolution satellite optical imagery and radar interferometry (InSAR) to infer the shape, location and orientation of the conduits feeding the 2017 Erta Ale eruption. We show that the lava lake was rooted in a vertical dike-shaped reservoir that had been inflating prior to the eruption. The magma was subsequently transferred into a shallower feeder dike. We also find a shallow, horizontal magma lens elongated along axis inflating beneath the volcano during the later period of the eruption. Edifice stress modeling suggests the hydraulically connected system of horizontal and vertical thin magmatic bodies able to open and close are arranged spatially according to stresses induced by loading and unloading due to topographic changes. Our combined approach may provide new constraints on the organization of magma plumbing systems beneath volcanoes in continental and marine settings.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Slow accumulation in a dike-shaped reservoir is observed beneath Erta Ale volcano prior to the eruption.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Co-eruption deformation is explained with hydraulically connected shallow dikes and a horizontal axial sill.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title The shallow magma bodies at Erta Ale are oriented according to stresses induced by edifice loading.TITLE Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia - ScienceDirect title Understanding the magmatic systems beneath rift volcanoes provides insights into the deeper processes associated with rift architecture and development. At the slow spreading Erta Ale segment (Afar, Ethiopia) transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading is ongoing on land. A lava lake has been documented since the twentieth century at the summit of the Erta Ale volcano and acts as an indicator of the pressure of its magma reservoir.

ScienceDirect title TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title A detailed understanding of a volcano inner structure is one of the key-points for the volcanic hazards evaluation. To this aim, in the last decade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have been proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a function of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is possible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up to now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon tracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion planes.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique, we propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting of the Cherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after crossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is imaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to reconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the advantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirect title A detailed understanding of a volcano inner structure is one of the key-points for the volcanic hazards evaluation.

The cost of instrumentation and the difficulty in using it under harsh environmental conditions is a significant impediment to the exploitation of gravimetry at many volcanoes. In addition, retrieving useful information from gravity changes in noisy volcanic environments is a major challenge. While these difficulties are not trivial, neither are they insurmountable; indeed, creative efforts in a variety of volcanic settings highlight the value of time-variable gravimetry for understanding hazards as well as revealing fundamental insights into how volcanoes work.TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title Building on previous work, we provide a comprehensive review of time-variable volcano gravimetry, including discussions of instrumentation, modeling and analysis techniques, and case studies that emphasize what can be learned from campaign, continuous, and hybrid gravity observations. We are hopeful that this exploration of time-variable volcano gravimetry will excite more scientists about the potential of the method, spurring further application, development, and innovation.TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title TITLE The added value of time-variable microgravimetry to the understanding of how volcanoes work - ScienceDirect title Despite its potential, time-variable volcano gravimetry is an underexploited method, not widely adopted by volcano researchers or observatories.

ScienceDirect title Fluids discharged from volcanic systems are the direct surface manifestation of magma degassing at depth and provide primary insights for evaluating the state of volcanic activity. We review the geochemical best practice in volcanic surveillance based to a huge amount of monitoring data collected at different active volcanoes using both continuous and discontinuous approaches. The targeted volcanoes belong to the Aeolian Arc located in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), and they have exhibited different activity states during the monitoring activities reported here. La Fossa cone on Vulcano Island has been in an uninterrupted quiescent stage characterized by variable solfataric activity. In contrast, Stromboli Island has shown a persistent mild explosive activity, episodically interrupted by effusive eruptions (in 1985, 2002, 2007, and 2014). Panarea Island, which is the summit of a seamount rising from the seafloor of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, showed only undersea fluid release. The only observable clues of active volcanism at Panarea Island have been impulsive changes in the undersea fluid release, with the last submarine gas burst event being observed in November 2002. The geochemical monitoring and observations at each of these volcanoes has directly involved the volcanic plume and/or the fumarole vents, thermal waters, and diffuse soil degassing, depending on the type of manifestations and the level of activity encountered. Through direct access to the magmatic samples (when possible) and the collection of as much observable data related to the fluid release as possible, the aim has been (i) to verify the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, (ii) to discern among the possible hydrothermal, magmatic, marine, and meteoric sources in the fluid mixtures, (iii) to develop models of the fluid circulation supported by data, (iv) to follow the evolution of these natural systems by long-term monitoring, and (v) to support surveillance actions related to defining the volcanic risk and the evaluation and possible mitigation of related hazards. The examples provided in this review article show the close relationships among data analysis, interpretation, and modeling. We particularly focus on describing the fieldwork procedures, since any theoretical approach must always be verified and supported by field data, rather than just by experiments controlled in laboratory. Indeed the natural systems involve many variables producing effects that cannot be neglected. The monitored volcanic systems have been regarded as natural laboratories, and all of the activities have focused on both volcanological research and surveillance purposes in order to ensure that these two goals have overlapped. An appendix is also included that explains the scientific approach to the systematic activities, regarding geochemical monitoring of volcanic activity.TITLE Review of the evolution of geochemical monitoring, networks and methodologies applied to the volcanoes of the Aeolian Arc (Italy) - ScienceDirect title Fluids discharged from volcanic systems are the direct surface manifestation of magma degassing at depth and provide primary insights for evaluating the state of volcanic activity.

ScienceDirect title Vitreous basalts and plagioclase lapilli from Tolbachik Volcano studied by high-temperature gas chromatography reveal features of a fluid regime uncommon to suprasubduction melts. Prominent depletion in volatiles confirms the anomalous behavior of the Tolbachik fluid systems. Vitreous basalts contain minor amounts of water (0.16-0.27 wt.%) and carbon dioxide (95-440 ppm). New data on volatiles in the Tolbachik plagioclase lapilli show very low contents of CO2 and total gas (exclusive of H2O) and enrichment in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) relative to the basalts. In general, analysis of basalts and plagioclase lapilli from different eruptions trace a progressive increase in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) and decrease in CO2 and total gas from past to present events. The concentrations of CO2 decrease, while those of CO and CH4 in basalts and plagioclase lapilli increase systematically with an increase in FeO/MgO ratios and K2O contents in the lavas and in anorthite component in plagioclase.TITLE Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirect title Vitreous basalts and plagioclase lapilli from Tolbachik Volcano studied by high-temperature gas chromatography reveal features of a fluid regime uncommon to suprasubduction melts.
