It is crucial that management decisions for wetland ecosystem services quantify the economic value of the ecosystem services. In this paper, we aimed to estimate a monetary value for coastal wetland ecosystem services in Liaoning Province, China. We selected 433 observations from 85 previous coastal wetland economic evaluations (mostly in China) including detailed spatial and economic characteristics in each wetland, then used a meta-analysis scale transfer method to calculate the total value of coastal wetland ecosystem services in Liaoning Province. Our results demonstrated that, on average, the ecosystem services provided by seven different coastal wetland types were worth US$40,648 per ha per year, and the total value was $28,990,439,041 in 2013. Shallow marine waters accounted for the largest proportion (83.97%). Variables with a significant positive effect on the ecosystem service values included GDP per capita, population density, distance from the wetland to the city center and the year of evaluation, while wetland size and latitude had negative relationships.TITLE A meta-analysis of coastal wetland ecosystem services in Liaoning Province, China - ScienceDirect title Wetlands are impacted by economic and political initiatives, and their ecosystem services are attracting increasing public attention.

ScienceDirect title Many countries are implementing Integrated Coastal Management (ICM, also known as Integrated Coastal Zone Management or ICZM) as a means to promote the sustainable use, development and protection of coastal environments. It has also been shown that there is a policy and institutional relationship between ICM and climate change adaptation. This paper examines the relationship between ICM and climate change preparedness of local government with reference to empirical studies conducted in two developing nations, Mozambique and South Africa. Using a mixed-methods approach (content analysis of local government planning documents and semi-structured interviews with key informants), results demonstrate the level of integration of coastal management, disaster management and climate change adaptation in local development planning; and assess the state of implementation of ICM and climate change adaptation by selected local governments in the two countries. The paper makes recommendations on how to improve ICM development and implementation for coastal adaptation. The results suggest the need for closer integration between coastal management, disaster management and climate adaptation frameworks; highlight the need for enhanced support for local governments from provincial and national government; and greater clarity with regards to the coastal management mandate of local government (especially in Mozambique).TITLE Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation - ScienceDirect title TITLE Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation - ScienceDirect title Local governments face considerable challenges in their ability to implement Integrated Coastal Management due to, among other factors, limited resources, capacity and competing demands.TITLE Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation - ScienceDirect title Frameworks for Integrated Coastal Management, Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Management are often poorly integrated at the local government level.TITLE Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation - ScienceDirect title Local governments require greater support from Provincial and National government to implement these various frameworks.TITLE Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation - ScienceDirect title In Mozambique, the coastal management mandate of the various levels of government needs to be articulated more clearly in the legislation to activate local government action on coastal issues.TITLE Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation - ScienceDirect title Many countries are implementing Integrated Coastal Management (ICM, also known as Integrated Coastal Zone Management or ICZM) as a means to promote the sustainable use, development and protection of coastal environments.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted to 27 residents from two coastal communities in New Jersey. Thematic content analysis is used to analyze these interview data. The study shows that awareness of mitigation infrastructure stems in part from experience with coastal hazards. Many participants understood the functions of both types of infrastructure in ways that were consistent with the understandings of coastal engineers, but did not fully understand how these two types of infrastructure interact each other to mitigate coastal hazards. Most respondents preferred natural infrastructure, but believed that engineered infrastructure is more effective in coastal hazard mitigation. The knowledge of public perceptions of mitigation infrastructure would be useful to coastal managers in developing and communicating coastal hazard mitigation strategies.TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title Residents preferred natural infrastructure in coastal hazard mitigation.TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title Residents perceived engineered infrastructure as a more effective option.TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title Residents lack understanding of interactions between two types of infrastructure.TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title Residents' awareness and understanding are localized to each study area.TITLE Coastal residents' perceptions of the function of and relationship between engineered and natural infrastructure for coastal hazard mitigation - ScienceDirect title Public perception research enhances the governance of coastal hazard mitigation.

However, important questions remain regarding biodiversity offsets to such anthropogenic modifications. Generally, while formal and accurate quantifications of the residual impacts from development and the gain from offsets are essential, they are usually designated on an arbitrary score. Particularly, a general baseline with uncertainties defined across a dynamic scope has rarely been reported. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to quantify the loss from coastal land reclamation and gain from offsets. It considered the correlation between biodiversity effect size and reclamation, and the risk of failure in restoration based on the offset ratios theory, to determine the optimal amount of offsetting by calculating the biodiversity ratios between damaged and compensated habitat areas. The Yellow River Delta in China was used as a case study. Fuzzy sets or discrete intervals of references were used as the baseline. Minimum offset ratios were calculated for different baselines and values of counterfactual scenarios accounting for time lags for different types of coastal land reclamation. Therefore, no net loss was feasible when biodiversity could be compensated within the offset delay time. In this study, unlike previous methods, designation of an arbitrary score to measure the habitat or biodiversity value was avoided. Instead, this method was based on the change in biodiversity and was grounded in ecological theory. A more science-based approach is proposed, which is supported with a novel formula and existing data sets. These findings will help in the design of biodiversity offsets for coastal land reclamation based on their different impacts on biodiversity. This will inform policy makers about realistic minimal offsetting ratios or offset area requirements accounting for the offsetting delay time, the value of counterfactual scenarios, the correlation between biodiversity effect size and reclamation, the risk of failure in restoration, and the gross quantity of restoration. These results have important implications for the ecological restoration and compensation of coastal wetlands in the face of coastal land reclamation.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Optimal offsetting was determined for different coastal land reclamations.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Mathematical models were developed to optimize offset ratios calculation.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Fuzzy sets or discrete intervals were taken to deal with baseline uncertainties.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Via simulation models, we show flexible offsets to different coastal reclamations.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Our work provides a means for ecological restoration in offset policy development.TITLE Towards a biodiversity offsetting approach for coastal land reclamation: Coastal management implications - ScienceDirect title Reclamation of coastal wetlands has a major impact on biodiversity globally.

This high biological productivity is attributed to coastal upwelling. This paper provides new insights on the structure, variability and drivers of the coastal upwelling south of Madagascar. Satellite remote sensing is used to characterize the spatial extent and strength of the coastal upwelling. A front detection algorithm is applied to thirteen years of Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) and an upwelling index is calculated. The influence of winds and ocean currents as drivers of the upwelling is investigated using satellite, in-situ observations, and a numerical model. Results reveal the presence of two well-defined upwelling cells. The first cell (Core 1) is located in the southeastern corner of Madagascar, and the second cell (Core 2) is west of the southern tip of Madagascar. These two cores are characterized by different seasonal variability, different intensities, different upwelled water mass origins, and distinct forcing mechanisms. Core 1 is associated with a dynamical upwelling forced by the detachment of the East Madagascar Current (EMC), which is reinforced by upwelling favourable winds. Core 2 appears to be primarily forced by upwelling favourable winds, but is also influenced by a poleward eastern boundary flow coming from the Mozambique Channel. The intrusion of Mozambique Channel warm waters could result in an asynchronicity in seasonality between upwelling surface signature and upwelling favourables winds.TITLE Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability - ScienceDirect title TITLE Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability - ScienceDirect title Upwelling south of Madagascar has two separated upwelling cells (Core 1, Core 2).TITLE Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability - ScienceDirect title Cores are subjected by different variabilities, intensities, and forcing mechanisms.TITLE Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability - ScienceDirect title Cores are generated by dual forcing: wind-driven and currents influences.TITLE Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability - ScienceDirect title Madagascar's southern coastal marine zone is a region of high biological productivity which supports a wide range of marine ecosystems, including fisheries.

ScienceDirect title Shanghai is more vulnerable and has a higher exposure at risk.TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title Coastal flood protection measures have been widely implemented to improve flood resilience. However, protection levels vary among coastal megacities globally. This study compares the distinct flood protection standards for two coastal megacities, New York City and Shanghai, and investigates potential influences such as risk factors and past flood events. Extreme value analysis reveals that, compared to NYC, Shanghai faces a significantly higher flood hazard. Flood inundation analysis indicates that Shanghai has a higher exposure to extreme flooding. Meanwhile, Shanghai's urban development, population, and economy have increased much faster than NYC's over the last three decades. These risk factors provide part of the explanation for the implementation of a relatively high level of protection (e.g. reinforced concrete sea-wall designed for a 200-year flood return level) in Shanghai and low protection (e.g. vertical brick and stone walls and sand dunes) in NYC. However, individual extreme flood events (typhoons in 1962, 1974, and 1981) seem to have had a greater impact on flood protection decision-making in Shanghai, while NYC responded significantly less to past events (with the exception of Hurricane Sandy). Climate change, sea level rise, and ongoing coastal development are rapidly changing the hazard and risk calculus for both cities and both would benefit from a more systematic and dynamic approach to coastal protection.TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (76KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title The paper explores why Shanghai has a higher flood protection than NYC.TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title Shanghai experiences a higher flood hazard.TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title Individual extreme events seem to have made a more direct impact in Shanghai.TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title Shanghai is more vulnerable and has a higher exposure at risk.TITLE Influence of risk factors and past events on flood resilience in coastal megacities: Comparative analysis of NYC and Shanghai - ScienceDirect title Coastal flood protection measures have been widely implemented to improve flood resilience. However, protection levels vary among coastal megacities globally. This study compares the distinct flood protection standards for two coastal megacities, New York City and Shanghai, and investigates potential influences such as risk factors and past flood events. Extreme value analysis reveals that, compared to NYC, Shanghai faces a significantly higher flood hazard. Flood inundation analysis indicates that Shanghai has a higher exposure to extreme flooding. Meanwhile, Shanghai's urban development, population, and economy have increased much faster than NYC's over the last three decades. These risk factors provide part of the explanation for the implementation of a relatively high level of protection (e.g. reinforced concrete sea-wall designed for a 200-year flood return level) in Shanghai and low protection (e.g. vertical brick and stone walls and sand dunes) in NYC.

ScienceDirect title Coastal zones are population and economy highly intensity regions all over the world, and coastal habitat supports the sustainable development of human society. The accurate assessment of coastal habitat degradation is the essential prerequisite for coastal zone protection. In this study, an integrated framework of coastal habitat degradation assessment including landuse classification, habitat classifying and zoning, evaluation criterion of coastal habitat degradation and coastal habitat degradation index has been established for better regional coastal habitat assessment. Through establishment of detailed three-class landuse classification, the fine landscape change is revealed, the evaluation criterion of coastal habitat degradation through internal comparison based on the results of habitat classifying and zoning could indicate the levels of habitat degradation and distinguish the intensity of human disturbances in different habitat subareas under the same habitat classification. Finally, the results of coastal habitat degradation assessment could be achieved through coastal habitat degradation index (CHI). A case study of the framework is carried out in the Circum-Bohai-Sea-Coast, China, and the main results show the following: (1) The accuracy of all land use classes are above 90%, which indicates a satisfactory accuracy for the classification map. (2) The Circum-Bohai-Sea-Coast is divided into 3 kinds of habitats and 5 subareas. (3) In the five subareas of the Circum-Bohai-Sea-Coast, the levels of coastal habitat degradation own significant difference.

This assessment framework of coastal habitat degradation would characterize the landuse change trend, realize better coastal habitat degradation assessment, reveal the habitat conservation tendency and distinguish intensity of human disturbances.

The lagoons are valued highly for the wide range of recreational services they provide, such as fishing, clamming, rowing, boating, or merely relaxing. Outdoors on or near the water, weather conditions may influence individual recreation decisions strongly. A changing climate is expected to affect weather conditions in Rhode Island, thereby potentially influencing when, how, and how much recreation will take place in the coastal areas of the state. Through direct observations of human activities on coastal lagoons, the sensitivity of coastal recreational uses to changes in weather conditions was assessed. If future changes in climate bring warmer temperatures and more intense wind and rain events, our results suggest that there may be a decrease in relaxing, rowing, and fishing on coastal lagoons when days are hotter and a decrease in rowing and fishing when days are windier. Nevertheless, warmer temperatures also may lengthen the summers, leading to an overall increase in the peak coastal recreation season. However, during the hottest periods, there may be a shift toward more motor boating and away from other uses, motor boaters were more resistant than other users to changes when temperatures increase. Understanding how weather and climate influence coastal recreation could help coastal managers and businesses better plan for the future in Rhode Island and other coastal environments worldwide.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title Different types of coastal recreational users are affected differently by weather factors.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title Rowed craft users and individuals relaxing are more affected by temperature than others.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title Rowed craft users are most affected by wind speed, followed by people fishing.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title Motor boat users and fishermen were least affected by precipitation and humidity.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title Altered weather patterns may affect the level, timing, and types of coastal recreation.TITLE The influence of weather on the recreational uses of coastal lagoons in Rhode Island, USA - ScienceDirect title The recreational uses of coastal lagoons (also known locally as salt ponds) contribute significantly to the important tourism economy of the southern part of the US state of Rhode Island.

These infrastructure components are often vulnerable to damage or failure due to the impact of floodwaters, thus leaving people and urban property exposed to flood hazards. To minimise the failure of hydrological infrastructure during intense flooding events, it is important to identify the most vulnerable components and to invest scarce resources in reducing their vulnerability. Using the concepts of exposure, susceptibility and resilience, this study proposes a graph-based network approach for measuring the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities. In this graph-based approach, hydrological infrastructures are represented as network nodes and the waterways as edges. The proposed vulnerability assessment approach is applied to measure and rank the vulnerability of floodgates in one of the most exemplary coastal cities - Jakarta, Indonesia. The results show that the proposed solution is both useful in highlighting the most vulnerable infrastructure components and also providing clues as to what actions can be taken to minimise infrastructure vulnerability. More so, the solution was found to be useful in identifying potential locations within the city of Jakarta, where additional infrastructure are required to improve resilience to flooding. This type of information about infrastructure vulnerability and resilience actions is vital to decision-making authorities responsible for planning, flood preparedness and priority-based allocation of resources for the maintenance of flood control infrastructure in coastal cities.TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirect title TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirect title A method is proposed for assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage.TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirect title Vulnerability is computed based on resilience, exposure, and susceptibility.TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirect title The usefulness of the method is demonstrated in an application to Jakarta floodgates.TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirect title Hydrological infrastructure such as pumps, floodgates (or sluice gates), dams, embankments, and flood barriers are invaluable assets used for controlling water in flood-prone areas such coastal cities.

In the Philippines, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003) decentralized the management structure and mandated Local Government Units (LGUs) to adopt new integrated solid waste management (SWM) plans. However, LGUs often lack the capacity, understanding, and enforcement authority for effective SWM. With minimal SWM awareness leading to socio-economic and environmental problems, alternative management approaches may be effective. This paper discusses the creation and implementation of a community-based program to educate community members and develop sustainable initiatives to improve SWM practices that have been observed to affect riverine and coastal environments in Tabaco City, Albay, Philippines. The Save the Rivers, Save the Sea program was designed as a way to engage students and local youth in environmental issues in their communities.

The action plan provides the program with goals and objectives in order to affect SWM change in Tabaco City's rivers and coastal environments.

In Canada, access to marine resources and ocean spaces is a significant issue for many coastal and Indigenous communities due to intensifying activity and competition in the marine environment. The general trend of loss of access has implications for these communities, and for Canadian society. In this review and policy perspective, we argue that access for coastal and Indigenous communities should be a priority consideration in all policies and decision-making processes related to fisheries and the ocean in Canada. This paper reviews how access affects the well-being of coastal communities, factors that support or undermine access, and research priorities to inform policy. Recommended actions include: ensuring access is transparently considered in all ocean-related decisions; supporting research to fill knowledge gaps on access to enable effective responses; making data accessible and including communities in decision-making that grants or restricts access to adjacent marine resources and spaces; ensuring updated laws, policies and planning processes explicitly incorporate access considerations; and, identifying and prioritizing actions to maintain and increase access. Taking action now could reverse the current trend and ensure that coastal and Indigenous communities thrive in the future. This is not just a Canadian issue. Globally, the ability of coastal and Indigenous communities to access and benefit from the marine environment should be at the forefront in all deliberations related to the oceans.TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title Access to marine resources and the ocean is important for the well-being of coastal communities.TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title In Canada, access is a growing issue for many coastal and Indigenous communities.TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title We examine factors that support or undermine access, research needs, and recommended actions.TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title Community access should be given priority in decisions related to fisheries and the ocean.TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title Taking action now will ensure that coastal and Indigenous communities thrive in the future.TITLE Coastal and Indigenous community access to marine resources and the ocean: A policy imperative for Canada - ScienceDirect title Access, defined as the ability to use and benefit from available marine resources or areas of the ocean or coast, is important for the well-being and sustainability of coastal communities.

Therefore, understanding SWI impacts is indispensable for informed decision-making on aquifer management. Despite advances in methods to assess the impact of SWI, it remains challenging to select appropriate methods that are effective, timely, and affordable under the influence of a range of factors including aquifer characteristics, hydro-geochemical dynamics, shoreline geomorphology, biochemical reactions, and data availability among others. This study examines commonly used methods that assess the impact of SWI towards the development of an assessment framework in coastal aquifers underlying densely populated urban areas. The methods were selected using complexity-functionality criteria and then tested at a pilot aquifer by coupling Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) and Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods and identify elements of the framework.

However, the barriers encountered in the industry have not been systematically studied in any region. From an Indian perspective, this study aims to prioritise barriers to coastal shipping development for effective policy interventions. It identifies important barriers through a Delphi study and then quantifies their cause-and-effect relationships by the decision making-trial and evaluation laboratory analysis (DEMATEL) technique. It is interesting that the main barriers, those have most impact on coastal shipping development, are not necessarily the ones most widely recognised. The study also uncovers the hidden cause-and-effect relationships between several barriers. Four main barriers are identified: (1) Indian maritime legislation (especially cabotage rules); (2) issues in the infrastructure and procedures at port and port-centric areas; (3) underdevelopment of small ports; (4) lack of a collaborative culture among the various service providers involved in the logistics supply chain. This study finally recommends relaxing cabotage rules to stimulate the inflow of foreign capital to grow coastal shipping, improving the current port system through joint efforts of the ports, Indian customs and government, and fostering supply chain collaboration.TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title Short sea/coastal shipping is a sustainable alternative to road transport.TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title Main barriers in India are in legislation, port infrastructure and procedures.TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title Cabotage rules should be relaxed to stimulate growth in coastal shipping.TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title Ports need to collaborate with multiple stakeholders including Indian customs.TITLE Barriers to coastal shipping development: An Indian perspective - ScienceDirect title Coastal shipping has been widely recognised as a sustainable and efficient alternative to road transport.

China is currently one of the largest countries to engage in this practice. In this study, a representative mariculture zone, the Weihai coastal area in China, was explored to determine the temporal variations in regional nutrients, N/P ratio, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and cellular abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates in response to the rapid growth in mariculture activities between 2006 and 2014. The temporal variations in inorganic and organic nitrogen concentrations in the surface water presented significantly increasing trends during August, between 2009 and 2014. A marked increase in the ratios of dinoflagellate to diatom abundance, concurrently with ascending N/P ratios, was also observed during August between 2011 and 2014. In addition, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate variations revealed the highest concentrations during October and lower levels during May and August, which was attributed in part to the seasonal growth characteristics of kelp cultivated in the study area. Moreover, the nutrient concentrations in Sanggou, Rongcheng, Wulei, and Rushan bays were affected significantly by the various cultured organisms in these bays. The intensive mariculture activity in the Weihai coastal area is likely one of the causes of the negative effects on water quality, such as eutrophication and future ocean acidification. The exploration of effective strategies is quite necessary in the future for keeping good quality of coastal environment and sustainable mariculture development.TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (193KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title Water quality was impacted negatively by mariculture along the Weihai coast.TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title The pH presented a potential declining trend since 2011.TITLE Environmental response to long-term mariculture activities in the Weihai coastal area, China - ScienceDirect title The environmental impacts of rapid expansion of mariculture have garnered worldwide attention.

The main processes causing such impacts at sandy coastlines and nearby coastal communities are storm erosion, overwash and inundation. Coastal response under present conditions and under predicted climate change has been frequently assessed on the basis of numerical models, which in turn can be also used to evaluate the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures to mitigate the response of the coast to the imposed conditions. However, detailed morphodynamic models are computationally expensive and not commonly used by coastal managers. The present work proposes the construction of a probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN) as a surrogate for the numerical simulations. This BN is trained with a large number of morphodynamic simulations, under a variety of storm conditions and DRR measures, in order to serve as a front-end platform for visualising, analysing and evaluating combined results of the numerical modelling. The BN introduced in an early warning system will be able to serve both, as a predictive and as a working tool to determine impacts and evaluate risk reduction after measures implementation.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title Here, an example of the implementation and results of such a BN system is presented. The BN system was built for a coastal sector of the Ria Formosa barrier island system (South Portugal) to inform the degree of impact derived from overwash and erosion over the study area. The BN boundary conditions include variable wave height, water level, and wave period. The impact on receptors, including houses and infrastructure, was assessed. In addition, this tool can inform about the effectiveness of a particular DRR measure. The evaluated DRR measures were two primary measures (partial house removal and beach replenishment) and a non-primary measure (improve channels of communication), all measures proposed by local stakeholders. Results show that for a storm with wave characteristics of the 1 in 50 year return period and spring tide conditions, the house removal DRR reduces the overwash impact by 15% and erosion impact by 58%. The implementation of beach replenishment could reduce the erosion impact of the same event by 96% while it would have a smaller effect on the overwash impact (16%). The implementation of non-primary measures would have a much smaller effect on risk reduction. The combined effect of the above DRR measures (mainly house removal and beach nourishment) reduces storm impacts at the study area to a value near zero. The BN surrogates the model simulated onshore hazards and translates them into impacts for the current conditions, which give a high degree of confidence in the potential application of the BN as a management tool.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title A novel probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN) method has been used to surrogate process-based models.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title The BN connects offshore hydraulic boundary conditions to onshore hazard and then transforms then to impact.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title The BN can be used to evaluate disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures, providing decision support to coastal managers.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title The method is generic and can be applied at many sandy coastal sites.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title Coastal communities are threatened by the impact of severe storms that may cause significant loss or damage of property and life. The main processes causing such impacts at sandy coastlines and nearby coastal communities are storm erosion, overwash and inundation. Coastal response under present conditions and under predicted climate change has been frequently assessed on the basis of numerical models, which in turn can be also used to evaluate the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures to mitigate the response of the coast to the imposed conditions. However, detailed morphodynamic models are computationally expensive and not commonly used by coastal managers. The present work proposes the construction of a probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN) as a surrogate for the numerical simulations. This BN is trained with a large number of morphodynamic simulations, under a variety of storm conditions and DRR measures, in order to serve as a front-end platform for visualising, analysing and evaluating combined results of the numerical modelling. The BN introduced in an early warning system will be able to serve both, as a predictive and as a working tool to determine impacts and evaluate risk reduction after measures implementation.TITLE Use of a Bayesian Network for coastal hazards, impact and disaster risk reduction assessment at a coastal barrier (Ria Formosa, Portugal) - ScienceDirect title Here, an example of the implementation and results of such a BN system is presented.

With this in mind, we developed a benthic sensitivity index (SI), based on the distribution and abundance of five ecological groups that can be used to assess community tolerance to organic enrichment and other disturbances. The index, projected as a high-resolution map, ranks communities from those dominated by sensitive and ecologically important species (i.e. low SI values) to those composed mainly of tolerant and/or opportunistic species (i.e., high SI values). Applying our model to a multiple-use case study in southeast Brazil, we were able to show considerable variability in the sensitivity of communities across the study area that was relatively stable over time. This allowed us to evaluate the possible direct (i.e., spatially overlapping) and indirect effects (i.e., cumulative changes to the physical environment) of a range of activities on sensitive and ecologically diverse benthic communities. Our approach and the resulting high-resolution maps hold promise for a range of spatial planning applications, including the development of coastal infrastructure, assessments of the representativeness of marine protected areas and other activities such as the selection of appropriate locations for dredge spoil dumping. Overall, we present a novel and transparent way of extrapolating limited survey data to provide spatial and temporal information on the sensitivity of benthic communities in multiple-use coastal and marine areas.TITLE Optimizing coastal and marine spatial planning through the use of high-resolution benthic sensitivity models - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Optimizing coastal and marine spatial planning through the use of high-resolution benthic sensitivity models - ScienceDirect title Effective management of coastal and marine resources requires knowledge of how community sensitivity varies spatially.

ScienceDirect title The coastal ocean circulation off the Chinese Subei (north Jiangsu Province) coasts in the southwestern Yellow Sea in summer is studied using hydrographic data from four research cruises, moored current meter data in the Lunan (south Shandong Province) trough, and Lagrangian trajectories of satellite-tracked ARGOS surface drifters in the summers of 2008 and 2009. The hydrographic data indicate a fresh water plume extending offshore in the northeastward direction from the Sheyang River mouth and a belt of relatively cold surface temperature from the surrounding areas located offshore of the Subei coasts to the south of the plume in summer. The drifter trajectories show that the Subei coastal current, which is traditionally thought to flow southward year round, flows northward in June through July under the forcing of the southerly monsoon. A northward intrusion along the submarine valley off the Changjiang mouth is indicated by the movement of the drifters, which is persistently strong and independent of the winds. Associated with the northward flow, coastal upwelling is generated offshore of the Subei coast to the south of the Sheyang River plume, below which upwelling is generated but is shut down by the buoyancy of the fresh water at the surface. Coastal upwelling is also observed off the coast of Qingdao city in middle July through early August of 2008, which is forced by the along-shore component of the southerly and southwesterly winds.

ScienceDirect title The challenges associated with managing systems of shallow coastal lagoons along a rapidly evolving coastline are illustrated in a case study of small lagoon systems in Ghana where these important structures are relied on by a range of different stakeholders for a variety of different purposes including fishing, tourism and salt production. Results of some water quality measurements are presented, showing that these lagoons have poor ecological status where they experience either a lack of flushing by the tide, or large amounts of anthropogenic inputs, or both. A vulnerability assessment is applied to the lagoons in question and this reveals a varying degree of threat from climate change to the operation and use of the lagoons. Our understanding of these systems suggests that a set of 1D hydrodynamic models, underpinned by an understanding of the local coastal sediment transport in each case, is appropriate, and could then be used to inform stakeholders and management in decision making. Integrated, broad-ranging management strategies must adapt to the realities of climate change in order to allow the sustainable use of these lagoons in providing economic benefits, ecosystem services, and elements of coastline protection for the benefit of the local and regional population and its economy.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title New data from lagoons in Ghana show variety of stakeholder interest.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title We assess the vulnerability of the coast to climate change.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Level of pollution is related to flushing and lagoon use.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title One dimensional hydrodynamic models are well suited to such cases.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Integrated coastal management is hard to achieve but has benefits.TITLE Influence of flushing and other characteristics of coastal lagoons using data from Ghana - ScienceDirect title The challenges associated with managing systems of shallow coastal lagoons along a rapidly evolving coastline are illustrated in a case study of small lagoon systems in Ghana where these important structures are relied on by a range of different stakeholders for a variety of different purposes including fishing, tourism and salt production.

Hence, this paper examines contemporary efforts to protect coasts in Demak, northern Java, Indonesia, which are threatened by coastal erosion induced flooding, through large-scale planting of mangroves. We argue that the success of such ecosystem-based approaches depends on wide-spread civil society participation. Our analysis of the structure of bonding, bridging and linking capital in Demak reveals that although some local groups may lack bonding and bridging capital, their ability to acquire linking capital enables them to monopolise resources from the state and international NGOs for mangrove plantings; this negatively effects the cohesion of the coastal protection program and therefore its effectiveness and inclusiveness as mangrove groups protect their own areas. The paper shows that an understanding of the social capital of different local groups can enable a better understanding of how to engage them in ecosystem based governance.TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title Geographical scales of the governing and system-to-be-governed should be matched.TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title A proper representational mechanism is key to the resolution of conflicts.TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title Coordination between governing entities is essential for coastal protection.TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title A better response and active efforts of government authorities is essential.TITLE Social capital, interactive governance and coastal protection: The effectiveness of mangrove ecosystem-based strategies in promoting inclusive development in Demak, Indonesia - ScienceDirect title While there is considerable literature on coastal adaptation, there is less scholarly attention for how social capital, interactive governance, and ecosystem-based approaches can be combined to promote inclusive development.

The fall model in the present study accounts both spring seepage and wave action, resulting in undercutting and this fall affects only the topmost laterite and the just below sandstone in the cliff. Slippage in this area affects all the litho-units and hence the geologic characteristics of all the litho-units are considered for developing the slippage model. This mathematically derived model can be used in other cliffs exhibiting the same morphology as well as the one controlled by the same influencing factors. This model differs from other models in incorporating multi-lithounits as well as multi-notches. Varkala cliffs form a part of the aspiring geopark in the Global Geopark Network and hence a study on the cliff recession is a pressing requirement.TITLE A composite fall-slippage model for cliff recession in the sedimentary coastal cliffs - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (281KB)Download full-size imageTITLE A composite fall-slippage model for cliff recession in the sedimentary coastal cliffs - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title This article describes the theories that contribute to implementing IC(Z)M from a governance and management perspective.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title It identifies three key outcomes from a case study of developing an integrated marine estate management plan.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Identifies the necessity for effective governance to allow for coordinated (interactive) planning and action.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Discusses management processes to address socially perceived and scientifically established threats to environmental assets.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Resourcing of management development, implementation and monitoring is fundamental to successful, sustainable outcomes.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title In 2013 the New South Wales (NSW) Government (Australia) established the NSW Marine Estate Management Authority (the Authority) to improve community engagement in coastal zone management. The outcome has been the coordination of activities and efforts of state government departments to maximize the social, economic and environmental values of the Marine Estate. While much has been written in regard to Integrated Coastal (Zone) Management (IC(Z)M) planning, papers that discuss its actual implementation are far fewer. This paper discusses how, given the minimal guiding literature in this area, the processes of IC(Z)M planning and implementation are being approached in NSW and its success to date. It is not a discussion of research undertaken, but a review and analysis of IC(Z)M in action, contextualized by a number of development approaches and theories that may help explain its emerging success in integrating government agency planning and activities.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title With reference to inclusive development and interactive governance theories, this paper discusses the principles and the five steps of the process adopted by the Authority. It reviews the challenges and achievements in developing appropriate and comprehensive consultation; threat and risk assessment procedures; and implementation and review processes. It concludes that the theory of inclusive development and interactive governance are well-founded and worthy aspirations in the IC(Z)M context. However, it also identifies that traditional governance frameworks of developed nation states, such as Australia, challenge the immediate and short term reality of achieving IC(Z)M. It identifies the key to success of IC(Z)M is the meta governance, expressed through the organizational culture of not only departments but their political masters, which need to be open, adaptive and flexible, and that this requires considerable focus as it remains an ongoing challenge.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title This article describes the theories that contribute to implementing IC(Z)M from a governance and management perspective.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title It identifies three key outcomes from a case study of developing an integrated marine estate management plan.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Identifies the necessity for effective governance to allow for coordinated (interactive) planning and action.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Discusses management processes to address socially perceived and scientifically established threats to environmental assets.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title Resourcing of management development, implementation and monitoring is fundamental to successful, sustainable outcomes.TITLE Managing the NSW coastal zone: Restructuring governance for inclusive development - ScienceDirect title In 2013 the New South Wales (NSW) Government (Australia) established the NSW Marine Estate Management Authority (the Authority) to improve community engagement in coastal zone management.
