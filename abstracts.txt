These include plentiful water in the form of streams, lakes, snowpack, and glaciers; high-quality sources of obsidian, chert, quartzite and other knappable stone; and a vertically oriented landscape that maximizes floral and faunal diversity within comparatively condensed space.The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectThe role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectEvidence for the familiarity of Clovis groups with the Rocky Mountain landscapes comes principally from three Clovis caches: Anzick, Fenn, and Mahaffy. All three caches are located in the Rockies, collectively contain artifacts made from ten of the highest-quality stone raw materials available in the Southern, Central and Northern Rockies, and at least one of the caches accompanies the burial of a young child who appears to have been interred intentionally on a prominent and likely sacred landform in a mountain valley.The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectBringing the paper's argument full circle, that same child's genetic profile shows a direct link to that of another youngster buried thousands of years earlier at the Late Glacial Maximum Mal'ta site in the mountainous Trans-Baikal region of Siberia.The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Truck safety evaluation on Wyoming mountain passes - ScienceDirectThe Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for Streets and Highways recommends hill signs be placed in advance of downgrade descent of mountain passes. Mountain passes increase the risk of a runaway, or out of control trucks and so the advance warning signs inform the driver to take special precautions such as reducing speed or using lower gears during the descent. The Wyoming Department of Transportation has installed steep grade advance warning systems on Wyoming mountain passes. However, concerns for out of control trucks on the mountain passes persist. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety effectiveness of steep grade advance warning signs for trucks on Wyoming mountain passes. The safety evaluation was carried out by implementing a zero-inflated negative binomial modeling technique for predicting truck crashes on mountain passes. The outcome was two models that showed the risk of runaway truck accidents were high at locations where either the grades were steep and long or the grades were long with multiple vertical curves. The analysis showed the current advance warning systems were not significantly impacting truck crash risks at the high risk locations. The study, therefore, recommends some improvements to the current advanced warning signs or implementing an improved Federal Highway Administration Grade Severity Rating System based warning system that will significantly improve truck safety at the hazardous locations. The study informs policy makers on the safety issues on Wyoming Mountain passes with regards to runaway trucks and makes recommendations for reducing the risk of runaway truck crashes on mountain passes.Truck safety evaluation on Wyoming mountain passes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrogeochemical characteristics of mine water in the Harz Mountains, Germany - ScienceDirectWater samples (springs, creeks, mine adits) from different former mining districts of the Harz Mountains and the nearby Kupferschiefer (copper shale) basin of Sangerhausen were analysed for major ions and trace metals. Due to more intensive water rock interactions including the ore minerals, the mine water concentrations of main components and trace metals are generally higher compared to non mining affected surface waters of the mountain range. Furthermore, the content of major ions in mine water is enriched by mixing processes with saline waters from Permian layers in the Kupferschiefer district and at the deeper levels of the mines in the Upper Harz Mountains. The waters of the different mining districts can be distinguished by trace metal occurrences and concentrations derived from the different ore bodies. Water from the Kupferschiefer mines shows the highest Na, Cl, Cu, Mo and U concentrations, whereas a combination of elevated As and Se concentrations is typical for most of the samples from the mines around St. Andreasberg. However, there are exceptions, and some water samples of all the investigated mining districts do not follow these general trends. Despite the influence of mining activities and ore mineralisation, hydrochemical effects due to rain water dilution can be seen in most of the waters. According to the elevation of the mountain range, higher precipitation rates decrease the ion concentrations in the waters of springs, creeks and mine adits.Hydrogeochemical characteristics of mine water in the Harz Mountains, Germany - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Phylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectPhylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectRevealed the phylogenetic relationship among Anatolian mountain frog taxa based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA.Phylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectPhylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectNo discrete population differentiation were found among Rana macrocnemis, Rana camerani, Rana holtzi.Phylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectThis is the first study revealed COI gene variation of Anatolian mountain frogs.Phylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectPhylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectPhylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectPhylogeny and systematics of Anatolian mountain frogs - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectThe characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectNear- to above-average precipitation occurred at Cypress Mountain for January-April 2010.The characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectThe characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectMuch greater daily precipitation amounts occurred at higher elevation (by up to 54 mm) during stronger upslope flows.The characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectThe characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectFreezing rain sometimes occurred, probably due to highly variable particle trajectories including upward motions.The characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectThe characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The characteristics of precipitation observed over Cypress Mountain during the SNOW-V10 campaign - ScienceDirectCurrent affiliation: World Meteorological Organization.Paleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectPaleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectDemonstrating paleoseismological sequence of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault first time.Paleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectSlip rate in Holocene is calculated from offset and deposition age of paleosol.Paleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectThe southern Zongwulong Shan fault is predicted to rupture likely in the near future.Paleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectUnmanned Aerial Vehicle was used to take topography survey.Paleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectPaleoseismological study of the southern Zongwulong Shan fault, Qilian Mountains, western China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Spatiotemporal response of mountain caribou to the intensity of backcountry skiing - ScienceDirectPrecipitation, landsliding, and erosion across the Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA - ScienceDirectPrecipitation, landsliding, and erosion across the Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA - ScienceDirectLandslide volume is positively correlated with mean annual precipitation.Precipitation, landsliding, and erosion across the Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA - ScienceDirectPrecipitation, landsliding, and erosion across the Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA - ScienceDirectPrecipitation, landsliding, and erosion across the Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA - ScienceDirectBudesonide Versus Acetazolamide for Prevention of Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectInhaled budesonide has been suggested as a novel prevention for acute mountain sickness.

ScienceDirectDetails regarding the mineralization patterns of gold in epithermal systems are poorly understood. A refined understanding of gold microtextures, the interface between gold and associated minerals, and the role that nanoparticles play in gold mineralization could provide insight into the details of gold growth and may contain indicators of gold ore concentration mechanisms. Furthermore, a refined understanding of the interface also may explain variation in cyanide leaching extraction efficiency and may enable enhancement of recovery methods. Macrocrystalline gold samples from Round Mountain, Nevada were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study suggests that gold nanoparticles are common in Round Mountain gold and associated mineral phases, and may play an important role in the formation of macrocrystalline gold in this deposit. Microtopographic evidence indicates that the two dimensional nucleation and growth mechanism is dominant and nanotextural evidence suggests that nanoparticulate gold was the first stage of growth in the formation of these macrocrystalline samples that grew rapidly at high degrees of supersaturation. Results suggest that the interface between gold and quartz and other related minerals is far more complex than previously thought, and that textures present at the interface and in the bulk gold can help explain mineralization history and can also have implications for gold recovery efficiency for macrocrystalline bearing ore.A study by electron microscopy of gold and associated minerals from Round Mountain, Nevada - ScienceDirectGold nanoparticles are common in Round Mountain gold and associated mineral phases.

Cantabrian Mountains (Northern Spain) - ScienceDirectGround temperatures determine significant geomorphological processes in a wet and temperate mountain with a narrow high elevation range belt. Twenty five temperature data loggers were buried at a shallow depth in different locations and altitudes and at specifically cold locations at two massifs in the Cantabrian Mountains (North Spain), Picos de Europa and Fuentes Carrionas. This paper analyses the ground thermal regime and associated parameters (e.g. freeze index, duration and depth of freeze, freeze and thaw cycles) and correlates them with active geomorphological processes and landforms. The thermal regime varies in accordance to the topoclimatic conditions, and it was possible to determinate annual phases in function of snow cover behaviour. Main active processes and landforms stop their activity with a large snow cover which thermally protects the ground and in consequence, avoids the freeze and thaw cycles. During this period, the records allow to asseverate the evidence of seasonal freeze grounds in several locations. Permafrost was not discover on the ground at any of the thermometers except one located at the vicinity of a relict ice patch. With the help of geomorphological maps and previous works, we got to establish the relation between geomorphological processes, landforms, snow cover and ground thermal regime.Ground temperatures, landforms and processes in an Atlantic mountain.

In this article, we offer an overview of the affective experiences ensuant with mountain biking over a range of common ride obstacles and terrain. By adopting a post-modern subcultural approach, our analysis reveals the link between rider affect and different components on mountain bike tracks. In doing so, our paper brings together the voices of dedicated and experienced mountain bike riders in New Zealand.Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectThe research follows a qualitative phenomenological methodology to explore trail components and affective experiences. Through the use of semi-structured interviews, datum has been gathered from 12 reputable mountain biker riders. As a highly experienced rider, the lead researcher's reflexivity is entwined in the research process and acts as a point of reference for many of the findings. This research increases knowledge in regard to ride experience, and the key components that help define the sport of mountain biking. The findings highlight how the strongest ride affects are brought about by the accumulation of experiences on various obstacles found on entire tracks. However, the affects can also be examined individually with examples such as jumps, drops, or fast sections. We also found that the obstacles on tracks that caused the greatest affect were those that were awkward, difficult, technical, fast, or overwhelmingly induced states of flow.Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectResearch defining trail components and obstacles offers resource managers important qualitative information for designing, building and maintaining new mountain bike parks:Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectProvides insight into how mountain bikers choose their ride locations and mountain bike parks.Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectProvides a qualitative overview for track designers and builders in regard to what trail formations are most desired by dedicated mountain bikers.Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectBike parks, trail networks, and individual trail managers may use these insights for the benefit of trail planning and site selection when considering terrain, gradient, elevation, drainage and overall rider satisfaction.Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectScarlett Hagen has been broadly involved in cycling for the past 15 years.

Global spatial statistics of paterae and mountains and their associated lineations reveal that both types of features are more common at low latitudes and tectonic lineations have preferred orientations, whereas straight patera margins are randomly oriented. Additionally, structurally controlled lineations tend to cluster with each other, and in areas of high concentrations these tectonic lineations are shorter in length than their global average. These results indicate that global-scale (rather than local or regional) processes are involved in forming Io's tectonic structures, but that the diversity of mountain characteristics and the collapse of paterae adjacent to mountain complexes are more locally controlled. Regional structural mapping of the Hi'iaka, Shamshu, Tohil, and Zal regions reveals Io's mountains reside in large, fault-bounded crustal blocks that have undergone modification through local responses of subsurface structures to variable stresses. Strike-slip motion along reactivated faults led to the formation of transpressional and transtensional features, creating tall peaks and low basins, some of which are now occupied by paterae. We propose Io's mountains result from a combination of crustal stresses involving global and local-scale processes, dominantly volcanic loading and tidal flexing. These stresses sometimes are oriented at oblique angles to pre-existing faults, reactivating them as reverse, normal, or strike-slip faults, modifying the large, cohesive crustal blocks that many of Io's mountains reside in. Further degradation of mountains and burial of faults has occurred from extensive volcanism, mass wasting, gravitational collapse, and erosion by sublimation and sapping of sulfur-rich layers. This model of fault-bounded blocks being modified by global stresses and local structural response accounts for the variation and patterns of mountain sizes, shapes, and orientations, along with their isolation and interactions with other features. It also provides a context for the operation and extent of global and regional stresses in shaping Io's surface.Lineations and structural mapping of Io's paterae and mountains: Implications for internal stresses - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Lineations and structural mapping of Io's paterae and mountains: Implications for internal stresses - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Geosciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794Paleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectPaleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectIn mountain streams, the scarcity of records hampers the analysis of flood process.Paleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectPaleohydrology allows us to estimate peak discharges of past flood events.Paleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectWe reconstructed past flood events in four streams in the Tatra Mountains.Paleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectLarger events have been reconstructed for the first half of the twentieth century.Paleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectOur results have implications for flood hazard analysis in the region.Paleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectPaleoflood discharge reconstruction in Tatra Mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Patterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectPatterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectSediments track Pleistocene and Holocene lake-level changes in Wyoming lakes.Patterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectPatterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectData from 107 lakes in western North America provide a context for the changes.Patterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectMaps reveal extensive aridity at the end of the Pleistocene after 15 ka.Patterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectMaps also indicate a north-south contrast in lake level changes after 9 ka.Patterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectThe paleohydrologic record of western North America since the last glacial maximum reveals a wide range of hydroclimatic variability in time and space. To improve the understanding of abrupt hydroclimatic shifts and millennial-scale hydrologic changes in the central Rocky Mountains, we reconstruct the lake-level histories of two small lakes in the Beartooth and Bighorn Mountains in northern Wyoming over the past 17 ka. To do so, we use ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and sediment cores to track the elevations of shoreline sediments within the lakes through time. We compare the stratigraphies with those from four other lakes in Wyoming and Colorado, and find widespread evidence for a Terminal Pleistocene Drought from 15 to 11 ka, an early Holocene humid period from 11 to 8 ka, and mid-Holocene aridity from 8 to 5.5 ka. The northern Wyoming lakes also provide evidence of high levels in the Pleistocene, possibly before ca. 15 ka, and rapid hydroclimatic changes that may have correlated with Heinrich Event 1 (ca. 16.8 ka). We place the changes in a broad context by summarizing and mapping water-level changes from 107 additional, previously studied lakes. Important patterns include 1) extensive drying across the western U.S. after 15 ka; 2) sub-regional differences during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition; 3) a north-south contrast from 9 to 6 ka consistent with a northward shift in storm tracks as the influence of the Laurentide Ice Sheet diminished; and 4) rapid increases in effective moisture across much of western North America from 6 to 4 ka.Patterns of hydroclimatic change in the Rocky Mountains and surrounding regions since the last glacial maximum - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Karyotypes of nineteen species of Asteraceae in the Hengduan Mountains and adjacent regions - ScienceDirectThe Hengduan Mountains region is a biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we report the karyotypes of 19 species (21 populations) of Asteraceae from this region, 14 of which are reported for the first time. We also examined polyploidy in Asteraceae plants and summarized karyotype data in the literature for 69 congeneric taxa. In these genera, there were five different ploidy levels in the region, though the most dominant was diploid (73.08%). There is no direct evidence that ploidy level and karyotype asymmetry are associated with the distribution of recorded Asteraceae species from the Hengduan Mountains. This suggests that polyploidy (26.92%) may not play an important role in the evolutionary history of these plants, even though, among these genera, the ratio of paleopolyploidy was high (46.15%).Karyotypes of nineteen species of Asteraceae in the Hengduan Mountains and adjacent regions -

ScienceDirectMediterranean mountains played an essential role during glacial periods as vegetation refugia. The SE Iberia Late Pleistocene woody angiosperm fossil and floristic evidences are reviewed in the context of phylogeographical studies aiming to identify (i) spatial patterns related to woody angiosperms glacial survival, (ii) structural and functional characteristics of montane refugia, and (iii) gaps in knowledge on the woody angiosperm patterns of survival in Mediterranean mountains. The distribution of palaeobotanical data for SE Iberia refugia has been found to be taphonomically biased due to the scarcity of available and/or studied high-altitude Late Pleistocene sites. However, Siles Lake data together with floristic inference provide evidences for woody angiosperms' survival in a high-altitude Mediterranean area. The main features boosting survival at montane contexts are physiographic complexity and water availability. Phylogeography studies have mainly been conducted at a continental scale. Although they cohere with palaeobotanical data to a broad scale, a general lack of sampling of SE Iberian range-edge populations, as well as misconceptions about the origin of the populations sampled, impede to infer the proper location of woody angiosperms' mountain refugia and their importance in the post-glacial European colonisation. We conclude that floristic, geobotanical, palaeobotanical, ethnographical and genetic evidence should be merged to gain a deeper understanding on the role played by Mediterranean mountains as glacial refugia in order to explain the current distribution of many plants and the large biodiversity levels encountered in Mediterranean mountain areas. This is hallmark for effective and efficient conservation and management.Mountain strongholds for woody angiosperms during the Late Pleistocene in SE Iberia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Spatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Spatial and temporal variation in sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains using nitrogen isotopes - ScienceDirectRetired.Assessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectAssessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectSoil organic carbon (SOC) and pH are critical variables for predicting other properties.Assessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectSOC is primarily responsive to land use changes and increases with elevation.Assessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectpH is responsive to land use and landscape position and decreases with elevation.Assessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectThe relationship between CEC, SOC and clay content depends on landscape position.Assessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectSoil properties varied more significantly by land use and topography than soil type.Assessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectAssessing drivers of soil properties and classification in the West Usambara mountains, Tanzania - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The resilience and vulnerability of remote mountain communities: The case of Vent, Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectThe resilience and vulnerability of remote mountain communities: The case of Vent, Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Landform development of mountains and rivers in Japan - ScienceDirectLandform development of mountains and rivers in Japan - ScienceDirectLandform development of mountains and rivers in Japan - ScienceDirectA proposed classification of river morphology into upper, middle and lower reaches, combined with the seven types classification of mountain morphology offers insight into the Quaternary development of Japanese landforms. The lower reaches of rivers in Japan are defined as lower area in elevation than the aggradation limit of sea level change. Terraces here are controlled by sea-level change. The middle reaches are defined as the part between point AL and the upstream limit of river terraces. Several terraces of older to younger ages are formed in middle reaches, indicating that the middle reaches are also uplifting. Sea level acts as the base level of erosion in the lower and middle reaches. River terraces are not formed in the upper reaches. Down-cutting for terrace emergence ceased at the LR, suggesting that the LR is stable. The upper reaches are defined by the LR point, which acts as a local base level of erosion.Landform development of mountains and rivers in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The roads of the Sayan Mountains: Theorizing remoteness in eastern Siberia - ScienceDirectThe roads of the Sayan Mountains: Theorizing remoteness in eastern Siberia - ScienceDirectArgues that remoteness as a concept is under-theorized in human geography.The roads of the Sayan Mountains: Theorizing remoteness in eastern Siberia - ScienceDirectRemoteness is a condition of relative immobility variously experienced and understood.The roads of the Sayan Mountains: Theorizing remoteness in eastern Siberia - ScienceDirectDraws on a case study of road networks in three regions of eastern Siberia.The roads of the Sayan Mountains: Theorizing remoteness in eastern Siberia - ScienceDirectThe Sayan crossroads is a distinct cultural and economic region in the mountains of eastern Siberia. It spans three federal units in the Russian Federation: the national republics of Tyva (Todzha kozhuun) and Buryatia (Okinskii raion), as well as Irkutsk oblast (Tofalarskoe municipality). Attempts at integration by the state during the Soviet period and afterwards have privileged the construction of roads in a variety of forms to connect these areas economically with regional centers and, in turn, the rest of the country. Yet this process has been uneven and led to divergences in the economic regimes in each of the three regions that make up the crossroads. The evolution of subsistence economies, exploitation by extractive industries, and the development of tourism as an alternative source of income all differ across the three federal subunits. In turn, these divergences within the crossroads as a region point to variation in the condition of remoteness. Remoteness is an instance of relative immobility, determined by physical geography, environment, and ethnicity. And remoteness influences the function that roads play in integrating state spaces both economically and politically. In turn, this article argues for the foregrounding of the remote in the literature on mobilities in human geography, considering what the condition of remoteness allows for and forecloses in the articulation of state power and the integration of hard-to-reach areas.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectMountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectWe tested Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectBeetle host selection responses were measured using no-choice attack box experiments.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectHost selection behavior indicated a high level of resistance due to repellent stimuli.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectConstitutive defenses likely play a major role in Great Basin bristlecone resistance.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectResults suggest low vulnerability despite climate-driven increases in beetle pressure.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectOver the last two decades, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) populations reached epidemic levels across much of western North America, including high elevations where cool temperatures previously limited mountain pine beetle persistence. Many high-elevation pine species are susceptible hosts and experienced high levels of mortality in recent outbreaks, but co-occurring Great Basin bristlecone pines (Pinus longaeva) were not attacked. Using no-choice attack box experiments, we compared Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle with that of limber pine (P. flexilis), a well-documented mountain pine beetle host. We confined sets of mountain pine beetles onto 36 pairs of living Great Basin bristlecone and limber pines and recorded beetle status after 48 h. To test the role of induced defenses in Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance, we then repeated the tests on 20 paired sections of Great Basin bristlecone and limber pines that had been recently cut, thereby removing their capacity for induced defensive reactions to an attack. In tests on cut trees, we also investigated the potential for population-level differences in mountain pine beetle host selection behavior by testing beetles from two separate geographic regions. Beetles placed on Great Basin bristlecone pine rarely initiated attacks relative to those placed on limber pine in both studies, regardless of the beetle population source. Our results indicate that Great Basin bristlecone pine has a high level of resistance to mountain pine beetle due at least in part to stimuli that repel pioneering attackers from initiating attacks, even when induced defenses are compromised.Mountain pine beetle host selection behavior confirms high resistance in Great Basin bristlecone pine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Holocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectHolocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectHigh resolution records from a peat sequence analyzed for Holocene climate change in Altai Mountains, Xinjiang.Holocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectHolocene climate in the Mountains distinct from other central Asia and monsoonal regions.Holocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectRegional climate comparision and possible causes for climate changes in central Asia mountain region.Holocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectHolocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectThe regional climate patterns have been generally dominated by alternations of warm-dry and cold-wet episodes during the Holocene that were quite different from the warm-wet and cool-dry episodes in the Asian summer monsoon region. Regional comparisons indicate that the climate changes in arid central Asia have been mainly influenced by the North Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) via the westerlies. However, owing to the mountainous character of the study areas, glacial meltwater, and other local factors, the climate changes in the Altai Mountains region have not always been concordant with variations of North Atlantic Ocean SSTs. We postulate that the history of moisture balance between regional precipitation, glacier and snow meltwater, and evaporation has been modulated by air temperatures that were mainly influenced by changes in the summer insolation of the Northern Hemisphere.Holocene climate changes in the central Asia mountain region inferred from a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Typhoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China - ScienceDirectTyphoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China - ScienceDirectDistribution information of broadleaved and conifer trees were derived from WorldView-1 image.Typhoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China - ScienceDirectHerbs formed dense and persistent mono-dominant thickets after wind disturbance, which affected stand renewal.Typhoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China - ScienceDirectWind disturbance diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains.Typhoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China - ScienceDirectTyphoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (134KB)Download full-size imageElastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectElastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectBiot theory and differential effective medium theory.Elastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectVariation law between acoustic velocity with fractured porosity.Elastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectVariation law between acoustic velocity with gas hydrate saturation.Elastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe crack shape and occurrence model of gas hydrate reservoir in the Qilian Mountain permafrost area.Elastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectElastic-wave velocity characterization of gas hydrate-bearing fractured reservoirs in a permafrost area of the Qilian Mountain, Northwest China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectAccidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectAccidentology of outdoor recreation and mountain sports remains underdeveloped.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectIncident reporting systems in mountain sports mostly refer to single-loop learning.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectCurrent data nonetheless enable researchers to unveil complex accident sequences.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectSafety related events in this field are likely to benefit from double-loop learning.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectSophisticated reporting systems might enhance risk modelling.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectAccidents are notoriously frequent in mountain sports, but thorough understanding of the mechanisms of accidentality remains limited by the fragmentation of sources and by mostly heterogeneous methodologies. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of prevention must rely on detailed knowledge of typical circumstances and scenarios. Rooted in the statement that an accident is never induced by a single cause but rather by a dynamic combination of factors, this paper explores the opportunities offered by a systemic analysis of experience feedbacks on accidents and close calls. The study identifies risk factors for several hundred mountaineering accident and near miss reports. In order to enhance the benefit of these descriptions and to show the interaction of a broad variety of contributing factors, it introduces graphic models. This is not an attempt to compress the unique richness of each story, but rather to create a tree structure using the concatenation of multiple testimonials, thus enabling researchers to build general lessons out of individual cases.Accidentology of mountain sports: An insight provided by the systemic modelling of accident and near-miss sequences - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Riding styles and characteristics of rides among Slovenian mountain bikers and management challenges - ScienceDirectThe increased interest in mountain biking on trails in natural areas necessitates the systematic management of mountain biking. In Slovenia, access to forest singletracks and signposted mountain trails, which are highly preferred by mountain bikers, is generally not legal. There is also a lack of mountain biking management and infrastructure at the national level. An important challenge for mountain biking management in natural areas is conflicts with other user groups, particularly hikers. This paper investigates the relationships between riding preferences and styles, conflicts, and attitudes towards mountain biking management among Slovenian mountain bikers. The survey results reveal four riding preference groups, largely consistent with three identified main riding styles of mountain biking in natural areas: gravity, all-mountain, and cross country. The identified key predictors for encountering a conflict with hikers are preferences for riding on hiking trails, the importance of downhill speed, and the frequency of practicing gravity riding in bike parks. Opinions about different management measures suggest the ineffectiveness of formal sanctioning, but a high willingness for volunteer participation in trail maintenance activities. The findings imply that the successful management of mountain biking in Slovenia should combine legislative measures for opening access to trails in natural areas, the establishment of single-use trails for specific riding styles, and indirect management actions to promote education in the fields of nature protection, responsible access, and trail tolerance. Mountain biking clubs and associations may offer a promising avenue for stimulating active involvement of mountain bikers and promoting education and bridge-building actions (e.g., volunteer work).Riding styles and characteristics of rides among Slovenian mountain bikers and management challenges - ScienceDirectRiding styles and characteristics of rides among Slovenian mountain bikers and management challenges - ScienceDirectRiding on narrow trails in natural areas is a highly desirable experience among Slovenian mountain bikers.Riding styles and characteristics of rides among Slovenian mountain bikers and management challenges - ScienceDirectRiding in natural areas is commonly practiced and largely tolerated despite legal restrictions.

In this study we examine the impact of the 2015 summer heat wave on a mountain grassland in the Western European Alps by jointly analyzing phenocam greenness (GCC) trajectories, proximal sensing, CO2 flux data and structural canopy traits. Phenocam effectively tracked the impact of the heat wave, showing 39% of reduction in maximum canopy greenness and a senescence advance of 32 days compared to mean values. The same patterns (i.e. reduction of maximum values and senescence advance) were observed for all considered canopy traits and photosynthetic ecosystem functional properties, in particular the maximum light-saturated rate of CO2 uptake (Amax), LAI and PRI. Pixel-level analysis of phenocam images allowed us to further highlight that forbs were more heavily impacted than grasses. Moreover the effect of the extreme event on greenness seasonal course was evaluated testing new formulations of the Growing Season Index (GSI) model. Results demonstrate that a combination of water and high temperature stress was responsible for the observed reduction of canopy greenness during the heat wave.Heat wave hinders green wave: The impact of climate extreme on the phenology of a mountain grassland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment - ScienceDirectInfluence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment - ScienceDirectSnow cover depletion and runoff simulations carried out in a mountain environment.Influence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment - ScienceDirectResults show consideration of spatial variation in melt energy is essential.Influence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment - ScienceDirectBasin-wide SWE distribution is sufficient to represent snow heterogeneity.Influence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment - ScienceDirectConsideration of local variability in internal snowpack energy not essential.Influence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment - ScienceDirectExperimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectExperimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectIndependent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of soil were investigated.Experimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectEffect of curing time has been investigated for the soil-stabilizer mixtures.Experimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectCement has a better enhancement effect than lime.Experimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectPozzolanic reaction is responsible for increase in the strength parameters.Experimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectGel-like (CSH) and fibrous (CAH) formations improves the geotechnical parameters.Experimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectExperimental study to examine the independent roles of lime and cement on the stabilization of a mountain soil: A comparative study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mountain Disaster Incidents and Corresponding Emergency Rescue Measures - ScienceDirectMountain rescue is a new topic emerged after the expansion of emergency rescue function of public security fire force.

ScienceDirectAlthough the ecosystem services provided by mountain grasslands have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to environmental and management changes in the past, it remains unclear how they will be affected in the face of a combination of further land-use/cover changes and accelerating climate change. Moreover, the resilience of ecosystem services has not been sufficiently analysed under future scenarios. This study aimed to assess future impacts on multiple mountain grassland ecosystem services and their resilience. For a study area in the Central Alps (Stubai Valley, Austria), six ecosystem services were quantified using plant trait-based models for current and future conditions (in 2050 and 2100) considering three socio-economic scenarios. Under all scenarios, the greatest changes in ecosystem services were related to the natural reforestation of abandoned grassland, causing a shift from grassland to forest services. Although the high resilience potential of most ecosystem services will be maintained in the future, climate change seems to have negative impacts, especially on the resilience of forage production. Thus, decision makers and farmers will be faced with the higher vulnerability of ecosystem services of mountain grassland. Future policies should consider both socio-economic and environmental dynamics to manage valuable ecosystem services.Future impacts of changing land-use and climate on ecosystem services of mountain grassland and their resilience -

ScienceDirectDisturbances may not increase the rate of vegetation adaptation to climate change.Forest composition change after a mountain pine beetle outbreak, Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA - ScienceDirectRecent severe and extensive mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae; MPB) outbreaks have created novel conditions in Southern Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests which historically had disturbance regimes dominated by extensive, stand-replacing fires. The goal of this study is to investigate patterns of and potential mechanisms in post-outbreak forest change in order to better understand the ecological legacy of the recent outbreak in the context of its implications for resilience to future disturbances and adaptation to climate change. To this end, we collected field data on forest structure and species composition in 2012 in lodgepole pine dominant forests in Rocky Mountain National Park. We then used a combination of modeling and statistical methods to identify possible mechanisms in post-outbreak forest conditions and evaluate the effect of the MPB outbreak on forest heterogeneity. We found that the outbreak initiated a shift in forest structure from single-cohort lodgepole pine stands to stands with greater diversity in age classes and species composition. This increase in landscape asynchrony may increase resiliency to future disturbances. However, this heterogeneity is a result of more spruce and fir on the landscape, species which are less adapted to projected future climate conditions. Our results indicate that disturbances do not necessarily increase the rate at which vegetation adapts to a changing climate, and that it is essential to consider disturbance type and available seed sources when predicting future forest conditions.Forest composition change after a mountain pine beetle outbreak, Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Safety of Personal Vehicles on Mountain Passes During the Winter Period - ScienceDirectSafety of Personal Vehicles on Mountain Passes During the Winter Period - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of TRANSCOM 2017: International scientific conference on sustainable, modern and safe transport.Landslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectLandslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectA first systematic landslide inventory for the Rwenzori Mountains is presented.Landslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectSlope steepness and lithology are key controlling factors for landslides.Landslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectMost landslides are rainfall-triggered but co-seismic slides also occur.Landslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectPreparatory factors for landslides are often human-induced.Landslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectLandslide characteristics and spatial distribution in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Integral expressions for mountain wave steepness - ScienceDirectIntegral expressions for mountain wave steepness - ScienceDirectWe study the wave steepness of mountain waves, a measure of wavefield nonlinearity.Integral expressions for mountain wave steepness - ScienceDirectThe theory is complicated by a singularity in the Fourier integral representation.Integral expressions for mountain wave steepness - ScienceDirectWe focus on solutions near the ground, where the mathematics is most challenging.Integral expressions for mountain wave steepness - ScienceDirectIntegral expressions for mountain wave steepness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Basement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectBasement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectField Relations and Geochemistry of Alkalic Flood RhyoliteBasement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectBasement Control of Alkalic Flood Rhyolite MagmatismBasement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectTectonic Setting of Alkalic Flood Rhyolite with Farallon Plate FounderingBasement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectBasement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectBasement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectThe Davis Mountains segment of Trans-Pecos Texas overlies Grenville basement and is separated from the older Southern Granite and Rhyolite Province to the north by the Grenville Front, and from the younger Coahuila terrane to the south by the Ouachita Front. We suggest that basement structure strongly influenced the timing and nature of Trans-Pecos magmatism, probably in varying degrees of impeding the ascent of mantle-derived mafic magmas, which were produced by upwelling of asthenospheric mantle above the foundered Farallon slab. Basalt was able to penetrate Coahuila crust in the Big Bend region. Thicker Grenville crust under the Davis Mountains retarded ascent of mafic magmas, allowing mafic plutons to differentiate into silicic magma that was eventually erupted as flood lava. North of the Grenville Front, magmatism was further delayed and thicker, older crust there may have helped concentrate magmatism under the Davis Mountain region. Only after the onset of Basin and Range faulting was true basalt erupted over much of the Trans Pecos.Basement control of alkalic flood rhyolite magmatism of the Davis Mountains volcanic field, Trans-Pecos Texas, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectSociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectSocial capital is used to explore rancher perspectives on sociocultural change resulting from tourism and amenity migration.Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectMountain resort tourism and amenity migration present opportunities and challenges to rancher socialization.Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectThis has not necessarily diminished rancher social capital.Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectConflict can instigate social capital development and contribute to positive outcomes.Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectIn response to rural restructuring, many communities throughout the Rocky Mountain West have shifted from extractive and land-intensive industries to service-based economies, contributing to significant socio-cultural change for local residents, including ranchers. This exploratory study uses social capital as a heuristic device to examine ranchers' perspectives on the way in which mountain resort tourism and amenity migration have affected their patterns of socialization in the ranchlands surrounding Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Findings indicate the importance of both formal and informal bonding and bridging networks within the ranching community. While the introduction of amenity migrants and their differing perceptions on land ownership and management appear to have affected opportunities for informal rancher social interaction, both amongst one another and with their new neighbors, they seem to have encouraged ranchers to band together to protect their livelihoods through informal collective efforts and the formal creation of bridging networks. This indicates that conflict can instigate social capital development and contribute to positive outcomes, such as empowerment and grassroots democracy. Mountain resort tourism and amenity migration therefore appear to present both opportunities and challenges that are altering the nature of rancher social interactions, but not necessarily diminishing their social capital.Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Climates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectClimates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectClimate warming effects on species temperature envelopes were studied in mountains.Climates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectFine-scale climate measurements were combined with long-term regional climate data.Climates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectTemperature regimes shifted upslope markedly since 1960s, but not for all months.Climates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectTemperatures typical of spruce-fir forests may shift beyond mountain peaks by 2100.Climates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectClimates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectTemperature regimes found in the 1960s at the lower range margin of spruce-fir forests are expected to be above most mountain summits in the northeastern United States by 2100.Climates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (136KB)Download full-size imageClimates on the move: Implications of climate warming for species distributions in mountains of the northeastern United States - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectPlace attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectFarmers' place attachment and location in high-mountain municipalities are related.Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectBeyond farm profitability other factors determine land conservation in mountains.Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectConsideration of place attachment broadens the understanding of economic decisions.Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectIn France, agricultural land abandonment constitutes a critical issue. Mountains, in particular, are reckoned to be particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon; therefore, several policy measures attempt to maintain agricultural activities in mountains. In addition to the role of targeted subsidies in reducing abandonment of mountainous areas, we contend that place attachment helps explain the permanence of economic activity in these areas. By using survey data and controlling for several variables likely to influence place attachment, we investigated the relationship between place attachment and living in high or lower altitude mountains in a sample of livestock farmers in the French Southern Alps. Applying an ordered probit model, we found high-mountain farmers to be relatively more attached to their place compared to medium-mountain ones. Our findings also suggest that social relations at the family and neighborhood levels, satisfaction at work, and the distinctiveness farmers assign to a place are important factors of attachment. However, we found no significant association between place attachment and farm profitability. Several policy implications regarding agricultural abandonment and support for mountain livelihoods are derived.Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectHydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe oil and gas indication (OGI) can be classified into two types.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe I-type OGI originated from the shallow source rocks of the Middle Jurassic.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe gas hydrate has similar parent biomass as the Middle Jurassic source rocks.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe gas hydrate originated from deeper source rocks than the Middle Jurassic.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe II-type OGI may have close correlation with gas hydrate on hydrocarbon origin.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectSurface surveying in high mountain areas, is it possible?

ScienceDirectMountain streams with their tributary torrents build the upper part of the fluvial network. They are important regarding the transfer of sediment from headwaters to lower basins. Channels are typically steep with wide grain size distributions, ranging from fine sand up to large boulders, and a stabilized bed surface. Mountain streams often are supply-limited with respect to mobile bed load, which needs to be addressed when bed load transport equations are applied to such streams. To better understand supply limitation, laboratory experiments highlighting the effect of bed load supply on incipient motion and bed load transport rate are discussed. Experimental tests were done in which fine bed load was supplied to a previously armored channel bed, with flow conditions ranging from one-third to twice the critical discharge for the bed surface. At flows not exceeding the critical discharge, the time series of the bed load transport rate at the downstream model boundary featured consistent patterns which are attributed to distinct phases: (i) a temporal lag, (ii) an equilibrium state, and (iii) a post-supply phase. Bed load transport occurred even at flows distinctly below that for incipient motion of the bed surface. But, with the mass of total bed load outflow approaching the supply amount, the mass did not exclusively consist of supplied grains. The coarser the supplied bed load, the more sediment was mobilized from the bed surface. At higher flows, processes differed. Total bed load outflow exceeded the supply amount and the break-up of the armor layer caused a refining of the bed surface.Effect of bed load supply on sediment transport in mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTransnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectThe number of transnational governance mechanisms for mountain areas is small but growing.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTheir spatial scope varies from relatively small areas, such as transboundary protected areas, to entire mountain ranges.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTheir thematic focus varies from relatively narrow issues, such as the conservation and sustainable use of individual species, to sustainable development.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectThey are most often found in Europe, Central Asia and South America.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTransnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectImpacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectImpacts of local circulations on the air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), China are investigated during summertime based on observational data analyses and model simulations.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectThe mountain-valley breeze and sea-land breeze circulations are well established when the large-scale meteorological conditions are relatively weak.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectThe onshore breeze not only causes the formation of a convergence zone to induce upward movement, mitigating the surface pollution partly, also brings back the pollutants over the gulf to deteriorate the air quality in the coastal area.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectImpacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (743KB)Download full-size imageImpacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Eddy Y.

Mountains, in particular, are reckoned to be particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon; therefore, several policy measures attempt to maintain agricultural activities in mountains. In addition to the role of targeted subsidies in reducing abandonment of mountainous areas, we contend that place attachment helps explain the permanence of economic activity in these areas. By using survey data and controlling for several variables likely to influence place attachment, we investigated the relationship between place attachment and living in high or lower altitude mountains in a sample of livestock farmers in the French Southern Alps. Applying an ordered probit model, we found high-mountain farmers to be relatively more attached to their place compared to medium-mountain ones. Our findings also suggest that social relations at the family and neighborhood levels, satisfaction at work, and the distinctiveness farmers assign to a place are important factors of attachment. However, we found no significant association between place attachment and farm profitability. Several policy implications regarding agricultural abandonment and support for mountain livelihoods are derived.Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectHydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe oil and gas indication (OGI) can be classified into two types.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe I-type OGI originated from the shallow source rocks of the Middle Jurassic.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe gas hydrate has similar parent biomass as the Middle Jurassic source rocks.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe gas hydrate originated from deeper source rocks than the Middle Jurassic.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectThe II-type OGI may have close correlation with gas hydrate on hydrocarbon origin.Hydrocarbon source for oil and gas indication associated with gas hydrate and its significance in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, Qinghai, Northwest China - ScienceDirectSurface surveying in high mountain areas, is it possible?

The most prominent example of Eco-DRR in mountainous regions are forests that protect people, settlements and infrastructures against gravitational natural hazards such as avalanches, landslides and hazards related to mountain torrents. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview on the influence of forests on risks induced by natural hazards and the associated challenges and uncertainties concerning risk analysis. Approaches from natural hazard risk are presented, along with recent results from forest research, thereby offering new ways to integrate forests into risk analysis. We discuss the potential effects of forests on the three important hazard components of the risk concept, namely the onset probability, the propagation probability and the intensity, and propose a set of guiding principles for integrating forests into quantitative risk assessment (QRA) for natural hazards. Our focus thereby lies on snow avalanches, rockfalls, floods, landslides, and debris flows. This review shows that existing methods and models for assessing forest effects on natural hazards suffice for integrating forests into QRA. However, they are mostly limited to the stand- or slope-scale, and further efforts are therefore needed to upscale these approaches to a regional level, and account for uncertainties related to forest effects and natural dynamics. Such a dynamic, rather than a static assessment of risk will finally allow for planning and implementing intelligent combinations of Eco-DRR and technical protection measures.Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction in mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTransnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectThe number of transnational governance mechanisms for mountain areas is small but growing.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTheir spatial scope varies from relatively small areas, such as transboundary protected areas, to entire mountain ranges.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTheir thematic focus varies from relatively narrow issues, such as the conservation and sustainable use of individual species, to sustainable development.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectThey are most often found in Europe, Central Asia and South America.Transnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectTransnational governance in mountain regions: Progress and prospects - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Is reproductive strategy of Alpine mountain hares adapted to different elevations? - ScienceDirectIn Lepus, litter size is inversely related to the duration of the reproductive season resulting in a consistent yearly production of around ten leverets per female. In high latitudes, animals have few litters with large litter sizes, whereas in low latitudes, several litters with small litter sizes are common per year. Knowledge on reproductive performance of Alpine mountain hares (Lepus timidus varronis) is scarce. In this study, we analysed 89 hares from Grisons, Switzerland, by examining placental scars and eye lens weight. The general aim of the survey was to examine the reproductive performance of female Alpine mountain hares. In particular, we focused on the question whether this subspecies adjusts the reproductive strategy in relation to elevation such as other Lepus species do in relation to latitude. All adults of our sample reproduced. 39% of the females littered twice and 61% three times a year with a median litter size of 3.00. We identified a significant effect of elevation on litter size, whereas the elevation did not influence the number of litters. We found no significant difference of yearly reproductive output across elevation range. Hence, some reproductive parameters seem to indicate that the Alpine mountain hare changes the reproductive strategy in relation to elevation similar to the mountain hares living further north do in relation to latitude.Is reproductive strategy of Alpine mountain hares adapted to different elevations? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectImpacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectImpacts of local circulations on the air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), China are investigated during summertime based on observational data analyses and model simulations.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectThe mountain-valley breeze and sea-land breeze circulations are well established when the large-scale meteorological conditions are relatively weak.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectThe onshore breeze not only causes the formation of a convergence zone to induce upward movement, mitigating the surface pollution partly, also brings back the pollutants over the gulf to deteriorate the air quality in the coastal area.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectImpacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (743KB)Download full-size imageImpacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impacts of sea-land and mountain-valley circulations on the air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH): A case study - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Eddy Y.

Only large-scale forest disturbance disrupted this pattern and maintained the historical heterogeneous distribution of grassland communities across all habitat conditions (especially species-rich mountain grasslands on poor soil). This prerequisite is stronger in pasture-woodlands where the ecology of the dominant tree species promotes forest-grassland segregation (F. sylvatica in our case) and less in naturally thin-canopy mountain forest close to the tree line (P. abies).

In Mexico, the disease was first described during the early 1940s by scientists who carefully documented specific environmental determinants responsible for devastating outbreaks in several communities in the states of Sinaloa, Sonora, Durango, and Coahuila. These investigators also described the pivotal roles of domesticated dogs and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (brown dog ticks) as drivers of epidemic levels of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. After several decades of quiescence, the disease re-emerged in Sonora and Baja California during the early 21st century, driven by the same environmental circumstances that perpetuated outbreaks in Mexico during the 1940s. This Review explores the history of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Mexico, current epidemiology, and the multiple clinical, economic, and social challenges that must be considered in the control and prevention of this life-threatening illness.Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Mexico: past, present, and future -

A research model was proposed in which three hypotheses were developed. Data were collected from a survey of hikers participating in mountain tourism in Malaysia. A total of 396 questionnaires were returned and analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The pull-factors that influence the hikers' to hike certain mountains are the effectiveness of the organising company, trail accessibility, perceived safety risks and the landscape of the mountain. The mountain landscape is the most important factor influencing hikers' assessment to hike certain mountains, followed by the role of the organising company. The mountain landscape emerges as the strongest predictor of the intention to revisit a mountain.Examining the structural relations among hikers' assessment of pull-factors, satisfaction and revisit intentions: The case of mountain tourism in Malaysia - ScienceDirectIn the Marketing for mountain tourism destinations four aspects are relevant:- landscape character- accessibility- organizing company and - perceived risk.

Currently there is almost no land in Armenia through the development of which it is possible to provide the population with food products, and the industry with the raw material. The only way to solve this problem is to increase soil fertility. The agriculture based on the achievements of contemporary science and technology also creates serious problems.Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectThis work is devoted to the study of the problems of changes in structural-aggregate composition of brown mountain-forest soils of the Republic of Armenia in relation to their agricultural use. The studies show that the structural elements of virgin brown mountain-forest soils are sufficiently stable and structured. It is shown that with the intensive use of agricultural lands, in comparison with the virgin soils, the most significant changes are observed precisely in the arable horizon (in particular, the arable layer significantly pollinated).Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectA set of agro-technical measures is offered to improve the structural-aggregate composition, to maintain and enhance the fertility of brown mountain-forest soils. In particular, the improvement of fertility, the efficient use and conservation of brown mountain-forest soils require the development and application of scientifically based system of agro-technical measures. If possible, the minimum or zero agronomic forms of agricultural tillage must be applied in the system of adaptive-landscape agriculture for the restoration and conservation of agronomically valuable soil structure.Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Journal Annals of Agrarian Science.High altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectHigh altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectHigh altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectIn most cases HAPE is preceded by symptoms of acute mountain sickness.High altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectMain symptoms of HAPE are dyspnea, tachypnea, cough, cyanosis, pulmonary crackles.High altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectImmediate descent and supplemental oxygen is a treatment of choice for HAPE.High altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectHigh altitude pulmonary edema in mountain climbers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tree-ring based summer temperature regime reconstruction in XiaoXing Anling Mountains, northeastern China since 1772 CE - ScienceDirectTree-ring based summer temperature regime reconstruction in XiaoXing Anling Mountains, northeastern China since 1772 CE - ScienceDirectThis is the first dendroclimatological reconstruction based on growing season temperature in the XiaoXing Anling Mountains.Tree-ring based summer temperature regime reconstruction in XiaoXing Anling Mountains, northeastern China since 1772 CE - ScienceDirectOur temperature reconstruction successfully captured most recent climatic warming and accordanced with other sequences from nearby regions on decadal timescales.Tree-ring based summer temperature regime reconstruction in XiaoXing Anling Mountains, northeastern China since 1772 CE - ScienceDirectTree-ring based summer temperature regime reconstruction in XiaoXing Anling Mountains, northeastern China since 1772 CE - ScienceDirectTree-ring based summer temperature regime reconstruction in XiaoXing Anling Mountains, northeastern China since 1772 CE - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of Floodplain Roughness on Velocity Distribution in Mountain Rivers - ScienceDirectThis paper aims to investigate the velocity characteristics of compound rivers in mountain areas, featured with substantially different roughness between the main channel and floodplain. A series of flume experiments have been conducted to investigate the velocity distribution affected by different roughness in the main channel and its floodplain. The experimental data are analysed to obtain a new empirical formula to determine the velocity ratio between the main channel and the floodplain. In addition to the roughness, the ratio between the water depth in the main channel and the floodplain also affects the flow velocity. Therefore the velocity characteristics vary with the roughness and depth in the subsections of the compound channel. The new empirical formula is applied to estimate velocity in the upper reach of Yangtze River, in Chongqing, China. The calculated results are found to be consistent with the field measurements, demonstrating the potential of the formula for estimating velocity distribution in mountain rivers.Effect of Floodplain Roughness on Velocity Distribution in Mountain Rivers - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of HIC 2016.Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectAnother look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectThe spectra of vertical velocity and pressure are dominated by wave bisecting the angle between surface and local windsAnother look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectThe spectra of horizontal velocity and potential temperature are infinite for waves normal to the local wind.Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectThe wavefield of horizontal velocity and potential temperature turn with height faster than vertical velocity and pressure.Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectSpectral analysis reveals a misalignment of wave momentum flux with surface wind, especially at small Richardson numbers.Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectLinear wave solutions in the spectral space are analyzed to help understand the structure of mountain waves. Nonrotating and hydrostatic waves generated in wind with directional shear past a circular bell-shaped mountain are studied. The power spectra of perturbed vertical velocity and pressure are symmetrically distributed about the orientation of dominant wave component, which bisects the angle between surface wind and local wind directions. The maximum power spectrum increases with the horizontal wind speed but decreases with the wind turning angle. The power spectra of potential temperature and horizontal velocity exhibit an asymmetric distribution except at the surface, which are infinite for the wave components normal to the mean wind. These large-amplitude perturbations of potential temperature and horizontal velocity are advected downstream and the waves finally break, giving rise to the occurrence of turbulent wakes at various heights. All the wavefields rotate with height in the same direction of the mean wind. However, the perturbed vertical velocity and pressure turn at a rate slower than that of horizontal velocity and potential temperature. The application of spectral analysis to the wave momentum flux is discussed, which helps explain the misalignment of wave momentum flux with the surface wind.Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectIncreasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectExisting glacier and permafrost landscapes in high mountains rapidly transform.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectNumerous new lakes come into existence close to icy peaks with degrading permafrost.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectVanishing of surface and subsurface ice reduces long-term slope stability.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectThe probability of flood waves from mass movements into lakes increases.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectRisks for humans and infrastructure in cold mountains are growing.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectWhile glacier volumes in most cold mountain ranges rapidly decrease due to continued global warming, degradation of permafrost at altitudes above and below glaciers is much slower. As a consequence, many still existing glacier and permafrost landscapes probably transform within decades into new landscapes of bare bedrock, loose debris, sparse vegetation, numerous new lakes and steep slopes with slowly degrading permafrost. These new landscapes are likely to persist for centuries if not millennia to come.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectDuring variable but mostly extended future time periods, such new landscapes will be characterized by pronounced disequilibria within their geo- and ecosystems. This especially involves long-term stability reduction of steep/icy mountain slopes as a slow and delayed reaction to stress redistribution following de-buttressing by vanishing glaciers and to changes in mechanical strength and hydraulic permeability caused by permafrost degradation. Thereby, the probability of far-reaching flood waves from large mass movements into lakes systematically increases with the formation of many new lakes and systems of lakes in close neighborhood to, or even directly at the foot of, so-affected slopes. Results of recent studies in the Swiss Alps are reviewed and complemented with examples from the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the Mount Everest region in Nepal.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectHot spots of future hazards from potential flood waves caused by large rock falls into new lakes can already now be recognized. To this end, integrated spatial information on glacier/permafrost evolution and lake formation can be used together with scenario-based models for rapid mass movements, impact waves and flood propagation. The resulting information must then be combined with exposure and vulnerability considerations related to settlements and infrastructure. This enables timely planning of risk reduction options. Such risk reduction options consist of two components: Mitigation of hazards, which in the present context are due to effects from climate change, and reduction in consequences, which result from societal conditions and changes. Hazard mitigation may include artificial lake drainage or lake-level lowering and flood retention, optimally in connection with multipurpose structures for hydropower production and/or irrigation. Reduction in damage potential (exposure, vulnerability) can be accomplished by installing early-warning systems, adapting spatial planning and/or by improving preparedness of local people and institutions.Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectIsolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectA new phlebovirus was isolated from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan.Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectThe virus, designated Kabuto Mountain virus (KAMV), was genetically characterized.Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectKAMV is phylogenetically related to the Uukuniemi and Kaisodi group viruses.Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectIn Japan, indigenous tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs) and their associated diseases first became evident in 2013 by reported human cases of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). In this study, we report a novel member of the genus Phlebovirus designated as Kabuto Mountain virus (KAMV), which was isolated from the ixodid tick Haemaphysalis flava in Hyogo, Japan. A complete viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed that KAMV is a novel member of TBPVs, which is closely related to the Uukuniemi and Kaisodi group viruses. However, unlike the Uukuniemi group viruses, the 165-nt intergenic region (IGR) in the KAMV S segment was highly C-rich in the genomic sense and not predicted to form a secondary structure, which are rather similar to those of the Kaisodi group viruses and most mosquito/sandfly-borne phleboviruses. Furthermore, the NSs protein of KAMV was highly divergent from those of other TBPVs. These results provided further insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships of TBPVs. KAMV could infect and replicate in some rodent and primate cell lines. We evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of KAMV in suckling mice, where we obtained a virulent strain after two passages via intracerebral inoculation. This is the first report showing the existence of a previously unrecognized TBPV in Japan, other than the SFTS virus.Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan -

ScienceDirectCave palynology has been widely used to reconstruct past vegetation in areas where other conventional sources of pollen are scarce. However, the mechanisms involved in pollen transport, deposition and accumulation in caves are still poorly understood, mostly because of the number of interplaying factors that affect these processes. In this paper we explore some of these factors further by assessing differences in pollen assemblages in transects of surface samples from six caves in the Zagros Mountains of Kurdish Iraq. Simple sac-like caves show a clear pattern in pollen distribution with anemophilous taxa declining from the highest percentages near the front of the cave to lower percentages at the rear of the cave and entomophilous taxa showing the opposite trend. There is a tendency for this pattern to be most marked in caves which are narrow in relation to their length. It is less clear at Shanidar Cave, most probably because of the geometry of the cave but also because of the disturbance and mixing of the superficial sediments caused by the large numbers of people visiting the cave. Only one of the sampled caves shows a different pattern, which is likely to reflect its geomorphological complexity and, consequently, its air circulation. Other factors, such as the presence of a cave entrance flora, are considered but here they seem to have little influence on the pollen assemblages, contrary to that found in temperate-zone caves.Palynology of surface sediments from caves in the Zagros Mountains (Kurdish Iraq): Patterns and processes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Surface dynamic of a protalus lobe in the temperate high mountain.

Western Maladeta, Pyrenees - ScienceDirectThe Maladeta protalus lobe is located in the Maladetas massif (Central Pyrenees). A detailed geomorphologic map, RTK-GPS techniques, bottom temperature of the winter snowcover (BTS) technique and datalogger to monitor the ground thermal regime were used to reveal the present-day activity of the protalus lobe and its location in a mountain permafrost environment. Systematic monitoring using differential GPS at eight fixed points throughout the surface of the protalus lobe shows vertical and horizontal displacements during the field surveys of 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The recorded dynamic defines a periglacial landform with low activity and rapid interannual variations in a thermal imbalance state.

Mechanized restoration treatments can improve forest health and reduce the likelihood of severe wildfire. These treatments produce some timber, and substantial amounts of forest residues that can be used to generate renewable energy and displace fossil fuels. Using the choice modeling method, this study investigates social preferences for generation of energy with woody biomass produced by restoration treatments on public forests in the Mountain West. Both multinomial logit and latent class logit (LCL) models are fit to the data and used to estimate marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for increased amounts of woody biomass energy generation and important associated co-benefits and costs. Positive and statistically significant MWTP is found for the number of homes powered with wood, the extent of healthy forests, avoiding increases in the number of large wildfires, and local air quality. Significant heterogeneity was found in respondent preferences for the attributes. The heterogeneity can be explained in part by sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents. The LCL revealed four classes of respondents with distinct preferences, revealing conflicting viewpoints toward forest management for woody biomass energy generation.Heterogeneity in Preferences for Woody Biomass Energy in the US Mountain West - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Detection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectDetection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectPermafrost distribution was examined in Retezat Mountains, Romania.Detection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectThermal monitoring and geophysical investigations were used to detect permafrost.Detection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectPermafrost is restricted to those sites where the ground cooling is very efficient.Detection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectThe observed chimney mechanism contributes to the permafrost preservation.Detection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectDetection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageDetection of mountain permafrost by combining conventional geophysical methods and thermal monitoring in the Retezat Mountains, Romania - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectAnalysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectWe analysed the effects of organic pollution in mountain streams.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectWe used functional and structural indicators in pools, runs and at reach scale.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectMost indicators differed in their behavior when exposed to high levels of pollution.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectSimilar behavior in pools and runs, while effects more easily detected at reach scale.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectCombining structural and functional indicators helps understanding pollution effects.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectMountain streams play a key role in the conservation of aquatic biodiversity and key ecosystem services; however human activities are threatening these ecosystems as mountain areas become more and more developed and intensively used. Many of these streams are not considered in current national monitoring programs due to their small catchment area. However, assessing their status and monitoring their trends is well needed to ensure their proper management and conservation. In this study, we evaluated the use of a range of indicators related to different ecosystem structural and functional components in 2 streams affected by sewage outflows and compared with an unpolluted stream in the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain). We surveyed benthic periphyton, macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and also estimated periphyton growth rates, wood decomposition rates and river metabolism. Additionally, we compared the performance of the selected indicators in different hydraulic conditions. Results revealed an effect of the organic pollution on most of the functional and structural indicators for the most polluted stream. Only the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party index, the invertebrate multimetric index used by the regional water agency, the fish abundance and biomass were sensitive enough to detect low levels of pollution and followed the expected response to the pollution degree. Moreover, most of the indicators behaved similarly under different hydraulic conditions, without major differences between pools and runs. However, the combination of both pool and run replicates at the reach scale resulted in a higher detection capacity of the effects of organic pollution.Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams -

Whereas mountaineering activities may contribute to the well established beneficial effects of regular exercise, for certain individuals these activities are also associated with a relatively high risk of death.Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectThis manuscript presents an updated overview of risk and protective factors for sudden cardiac death during leisure activities in the mountains.Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectSudden cardiac death (SCD) has been proven to be the most frequent cause of non traumatic death in males aged over 34 years, e.g. during mountain hiking, cross country skiing or downhill skiing. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and, in particular, prior myocardial infarction, are the most important risk factors for SCD, predominantly relevant in downhill skiers. The unusual physical exertion on the first day at altitude, the late morning hours and the prolonged abstinence from food and fluid intake during exercise at altitude are most important triggers. Acute hypoxia may represent a trigger for SCD on the one hand but might also evoke beneficial effects by preconditioning on the other hand.Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectThe identification of high-risk subjects and SCD triggers, evidence-based therapy of treatable risk factors, the appropriate individual preparation by physical training, and considering behavioural aspects, especially at the beginning of the physically active altitude sojourn will help to prevent SCD and increase the health benefits generated by mountaineering activities.Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of Road De-icing on the Hydrogeochemistry of Groundwater from a Mountain Area (Serra da Estrela, Central Portugal) - ScienceDirectThe importance of Mountains for the world's water supply has been increasingly recognized. However, in many cases the existing roads require regular de-icing operations which may have a severe impact on the natural hydrogeochemical conditions of the local hydrological systems due to the regular use of substances such as sodium chloride and calcium chloride. The Serra da Estrela Mountain is a strategic area for the water resources management in Portugal because of its geological, geomorphological and climatic framework. This study was carried out in the highest part of the mountain, where road de-icing is frequent during winter. The hydrogeochemical characteristics of several springs, located downstream from roads between 1500 m a.s.l. and 1990 m a.s.l., present clear anthropic signatures which disturbs the quality of the local water resources.Impact of Road De-icing on the Hydrogeochemistry of Groundwater from a Mountain Area (Serra da Estrela, Central Portugal) - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of WRI-15.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectPredicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectPesticide concentrations in water typically exhibit short-term peaks.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectIn small cultivated mountain basins, peaks can be shorter but much higher.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectExisting models are not suitable to predict exposure in mountain basins.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDynAPlus model allows evaluating such situations.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDynAPlus could potentially be used to improve ecological risk assessment.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectPredicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (295KB)Download full-size imagePredicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectCurrent address: European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Via Carlo Magno 1, 43125 Parma, Italy.Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDisclaimer - A.

Mountain front sinuosity (Smf) index values close to one are indicative of the active nature of the mountain front all along the eastern Arunachal Himalaya, which can be directly attributed to the regional uplift along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT). However, the mountain front is significantly sinusoidal around junctions between HFT/MBT (Main Boundary Thrust) and active transverse faults. The high values of stream length gradient (SL) and stream steepness (Ks) indices together with field evidence of fault scarps, offset of terraces, and deflection of streams are markers of neotectonic uplift along the thrusts and transverse faults. This reactivation of transverse faults has given rise to extensional basins leading to widening of the river courses, providing favourable sites for deposition of recent sediments. Tectonic interactions of these transverse faults with the Himalayan longitudinal thrusts (MBT/HFT) have segmented the mountain front marked with varying sinuosity. The net result is that a variety of tectonic landforms recognized along the mountain front can be tracked to the complex interactions among the transverse and longitudinal tectonic elements. Some distinctive examples are: in the eastern extremity of NE Himalaya across the Dibang River valley, the NW-SE trending mountain front is attenuated by the active Mishmi Thrust that has thrust the Mishmi crystalline complex directly over the alluvium of the Brahmaputra plains. The junction of the folded HFT and Mishmi Thrust shows a zone of brecciated and pulverized rocks along which transverse axial planar fracture cleavages exhibit neotectonic activities in a transverse fault zone coinciding with the Dibang River course. Similarly, the transverse faults cut the mountain front along the Sesseri, Siluk, Siku, Siang, Mingo, Sileng, Dikari, and Simen rivers. At some such junctions, landforms associated with the active right-lateral strike-slip faults are superposed over the earlier landforms formed by transverse normal faults. In addition to linear transverse features, we see evidence that the fold-thrust belt of the frontal part of the Arunachal Himalaya has also been affected by the neotectonically active NW-SE trending major fold known as the Siang antiform that again is aligned transverse to the mountain front. The folding of the HFT and MBT along this antiform has reshaped the landscape developed between its two western and eastern limbs running N-S and NW-SE, respectively. The transverse faults are parallel to the already reported deep-seated transverse seismogenic strike-slip fault. Therefore, a single take home message is that any true manifestation of the neotectonics and seismic hazard assessment in the Himalayan region must take into account the role of transverse tectonics.Transverse tectonic structural elements across Himalayan mountain front, eastern Arunachal Himalaya, India: Implication of superposed landform development on analysis of neotectonics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectHolocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectHolocene glacier activity throughout the Coast Mountains is synthesized.Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectActivity is synchronous with the global record and regional climate change.Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectThe Aleutian Low appears to play an important role in long term glacier activity.Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectThe Coast Mountains flank the Pacific Ocean in western British Columbia, Canada.

This mountainous area is situated on the transition zone between the Mediterranean and Black Sea climates. Thus, it has ecologically interesting features. The purpose of this study is to explain the ecogeographical features of the ecosystem of Kaz Mountain. To that end, all physical features such as geomorphological, geological, climate, soil, hydrographical, vegetation, and fauna features were examined. The data obtained was compiled and classified. Hence, ecogeographical features of the area were revealed. Some parts of Kaz mountains were previously declared a national park for the purpose of protection. However, the national park does not cover all of the mountainous mass. The population pressure on the area is constantly increasing. For this reason, national park boundaries should be expanded to protect the whole ecosystem.Ecogeography of Kaz Mountain Ecosystem - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of GEOMED2013.Crustal mechanics control the geometry of mountain belts.

The origin of the She population has been controversial. The purpose of this work was to investigate the genomic diversity of She. The Chaoshan She population living in the Chaoshan Fenghuang mountain is a relatively isolated population. We detected 14 Y chromosome biallelic markers (Y-SNPs) and 6 Y chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci in Chaoshan She people. Y-SNP analysis showed the Chaoshan She was closely related to the Chaoshan Hakka, Chaoshanese, Tujia and Gaoshan national minority. Compared with the Fujian She, the Chaoshan She maintained a more southern native genetic structure. Y-STR analysis revealed the Chaoshan She population was more closely related to the Hakka population than the other Hans. We concluded the Chaoshan She population had a closer genetic relationship with the southern national minority and Hakka Han and it may be representative of She ancestors' patrilineal genetic structure.Patrilineal background of the She minority population from Chaoshan Fenghuang Mountain, an isolated mountain region, in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Patrilineal background of the She minority population from Chaoshan Fenghuang Mountain, an isolated mountain region, in China - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this paper.Chronology of latest Pleistocene mountain glaciation in the western Wasatch Mountains, Utah, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectChronology of latest Pleistocene mountain glaciation in the western Wasatch Mountains, Utah, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessment of the debris-flow susceptibility in tropical mountains using clast distribution patterns - ScienceDirectAssessment of the debris-flow susceptibility in tropical mountains using clast distribution patterns - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectLong-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectDifferent distributions of PAHs were observed with elevation and side of mountain.Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectLong-range transport is a major contributor to PAHs in the Changbai Mountain soil.Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectCold trapping seems to occur on the southern and western sides of the mountain.Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectLocal sources in the mountain are minor contributors to PAHs in the mountain soil.Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectLong-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectCo-corresponding author.

The increasing evidence of the many vulnerabilities of mountain social-ecological systems has highlighted the urgent need for policy-relevant research into ways of coping with these trends. In this context, resilience has been emerging as a concept for both understanding and managing the complex social-ecological systems in which ES are provided and consumed. Yet, literature on resilience of social-ecological systems is mainly theoretical with limited application in real-world mountain case studies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the social-ecological resilience of a case study in the Swiss Alps under global change. We model and evaluate an indicator for resilience that shows the capacity of the mountain social-ecological system to provide a set of demanded ES. In a first step, we model the development of this indicator in different scenarios of global change. In a second step, we test the effect of a rich set of policy strategies under all these scenarios to identify types and timing of interventions that are robust under multiple global change settings. Results indicate that the resilience of the mountain social-ecological system is endangered in all scenarios, especially if strong globalization is assumed. Robust strategies that buffer the system against these pressures require early spatial planning action in combination with more targeted direct payments to support the current regional structure and traditional mountain farming practices. Such information is crucial to guide decision-making processes in the era of highly uncertain future global change.Policy strategies to foster the resilience of mountain social-ecological systems under uncertain global change - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectUsing functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectFunctional traits reveal ecological process driving plant responses to disturbance.Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectRelative impacts from biking and hiking were assessed using functional traits.Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectTaller plants with large leaves but low percent dry matter content were more resistant.Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectMountain biking only caused more damage than hiking at high levels of use.Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectUsing functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectActive layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe soil thermal regime is characteristic of polar desert affected by Dry-permafrost.Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectVariations in soil temperature are intense during the summer, showing the response to radiation.Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe periglacial landforms, are not in phase with the present polar cold desert climate.Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe landscape dynamics evolves under scarce conditions that last for very short times.Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe thermal regime at Ellsworth is comparable to other continental areas such as the dry-valleys.Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectActive layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Building ex ante resilience of disaster-exposed mountain communities: Drawing insights from the Nepal earthquake recovery - ScienceDirectBuilding ex ante resilience of disaster-exposed mountain communities: Drawing insights from the Nepal earthquake recovery - ScienceDirectPresent address: School of Social Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.Building ex ante resilience of disaster-exposed mountain communities: Drawing insights from the Nepal earthquake recovery - ScienceDirectPresent address: Environmental Studies (MSc. 2018), University of Oregon, Eugene, United States.Can monsoon moisture arrive in the Qilian Mountains in summer?

ScienceDirectThis study used data of 128 worker households that possessed woodland resources and owned by seven forestry bureaus (counties) belonging to the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains to analyze the behavioral characteristics of worker households that engaged in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) business activities. A logistic regression model was utilized to analyze factors that influenced worker households to engage in NTFPs business activities. The study found the following: NTFPs collection activities had become the primary NTFPs business activity engaged in by the worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains because of the relatively small investment needed as well as fewer production and operating risks. The engagement of worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains in NTFPs business activities was still in a preliminary stage. Whether or not worker households engaged in NTFPs business activities was not affected by household head or household manpower characteristics; rather, worker households were more willing to engage in NTFPs business activities when the households had bank deposits, homes were close to the woodlands, the woodlands had good quality soil, and the households received social services.Determinants of engagement in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) business activities: A study on worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains, northeastern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectMountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectMountain biking as a form of human mediated seed dispersal was assessed.Mountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectSmall and light seeds were dispersed over hundreds of meters on tires.Mountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectMountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectMountain biking might unintentionally promote the dispersal of undesirable species.Mountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectCleaning bikes between rides or weed control at trails could lower negative effects.Mountain bikes as seed dispersers and their potential socio-ecological consequences - ScienceDirectSeed dispersal critically influences plant community composition and species distributions.

We use the general term mountain waves to include all terrain-generated gravity waves. These waves are stationary, i.e., they remain fixed to the generating obstacle. We shall see that because of this we can estimate the amplitudes of these waves using the size scales of the obstacles and the local meteorological conditions. This is not possible for any other atmospheric wave phenomena. The types and sizes of these obstacles include, for example, mountain ranges, broad valleys, large islands, isolated peaks, large thunderstorms, small ridges, and valleys, and gently rolling hills. Areas of isolated surface temperature anomalies such as arctic leads or large cities can act as an equivalent mountain and generate gravity waves. Mountain waves play an essential role if the global circulation of the atmosphere. Mountain waves can produce destructive Bora winds which occur world wide. We shall see that the essence of these complex flows are contained in the linear wave theory. Chapter 3 will give the reader the tools necessary for advanced study of this important topic.Mountain Waves - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectModelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectUniform design method is adopted for sampling considering uncertainties.Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectThe support vector machine is used to reduce computation time and resources.Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectFeasibility and validity of proposed method are proven by empirical data.Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectIn the paper, an analytical method is proposed to develop seismic fragility analysis for rock mountain tunnels. We consider four types of uncertainties in the fragility analysis including different ground motions, tunnel depths, rock mass and lining thickness. By using the uniform design method (UDM), numerical experiment samples are generated. The verified dynamic numerical simulation (DNS) model is carried out to develop probabilistic seismic demand models. To optimize conventional methodology, a prediction technique support vector machine (SVM) is employed. The SVM model could help to reduce calculation resource. It is concluded that (1) the proposed uniform design-dynamic numerical simulation-support vector machine (UDM-DNS-SVM) method could provide accurate estimated fragility curves considering multiple uncertainties; (2) comparisons among the proposed fragility curves, case studies and empirical curves verified feasibility of proposed fragility curves.Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectMeasurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectCPOM transport is fairly well measurable with bedload traps in wadeable streams.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectPronounced hysteresis requires intensive sampling for accurate estimating CPOM load.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectKnown CPOM hysteresis patterns useful for enhancing poorly sampled CPOM time series.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectRough estimates of CPOM transport relation possible in coniferous mountain streams.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectMeasurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectMeasurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 (303) 440 8795.Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectCurrent address: Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Telegrafenberg, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

Adaptation strategies (general, overarching) and adaptation tactics (specific, on-the-ground) were elicited from resource specialists and stakeholders through a workshop process. For water supply and infrastructure, primary adaptation strategies restore hydrologic function of watersheds, connect floodplains, support groundwater-dependent ecosystems, maximize valley storage, and reduce fire hazard. For fisheries, strategies maintain or restore natural flow regimes and thermal conditions, improve water conservation, decrease fragmentation of stream networks, and develop geospatial data on stream temperature and geologic hazards. For upland vegetation, disturbance-focused strategies reduce severity and patch size of disturbances, protect refugia, increase resilience of native vegetation by reducing non-climate stressors, protect genotypic and phenotypic diversity, and focus on functional systems (not just species). For special habitats (riparian areas, wetlands, groundwater-dependent ecosystems), strategies restore or maintain natural flow regimes, maintain appropriate plant densities, improve soil health and streambank stability, and reduce non-climate stressors. Prominent interactions of resource effects makes coordination critical for implementation and effectiveness of adaptation tactics and restoration projects in the Blue Mountains.Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectQuantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectElevation is consistently a lead predictor variable of fire return intervals (FRI).Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectAspect is a significant variable only in the Subalpine.Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectThe combined effect of high elevation and cool aspect leads to forming fire refugia.Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectThe shortest FRI are on the combined low elevation and warm aspect.Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectIn the Subalpine, warm aspects are twice as likely to burn than cool aspects.Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectQuantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals in the Canadian Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectOrbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectEccentricity and precession can drive landscape evolution in continental interiors.Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectEccentricity and precession impact modeled summer runoff in northeastern Wyoming.Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectPrecipitation may be the dominant geomorphic driver in some intermontane basins.Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectOrbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectCold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectPine hosts affected MPB development rate and cold tolerance.Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectPupal and teneral adult stages are less cold tolerant than larval stages.Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectTrade-offs may occur between rapid development and winter survival at advanced stages.Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectLower lethal temperature models better predicted mortality than supercooling point models.Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectNovel hosts may have unforeseen impacts on herbivore life history traits. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is a tree-killing bark beetle native to western North America but constrained by cold temperatures in the northern limits of its distribution. In recent years, this insect has spread north and east of its historical range, and continued expansion, or accidental introduction, could result in the mountain pine beetle becoming invasive in eastern North America. The limiting effect of cold temperatures among novel host pines is unknown, yet crucial for understanding the risk posed to northeastern North American forests. We report the susceptibility of mountain pine beetle to cold temperatures while overwintering in six different pine species. Brood developed in two western pine hosts (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm. and P. ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) as well as four eastern pines (P. banksiana Lamb., P. resinosa Ait., P. strobus L. and P. sylvestris L.) novel to this insect. The cold tolerance and cold tolerance strategy of the most common overwintering stage varied by host and year. Models describing lower lethal temperatures more accurately predicted observed field mortality of overwintering larvae than models based on temperatures at which larvae froze. Rapid development to less cold tolerant pupal and adult stages by brood in novel hosts prior to winter may constitute a trade-off between increased host suitability and winter mortality. We demonstrate that overwintering survival of mountain pine beetles in novel hosts depends on a match between the climate and ecophysiological effects of pine species. These results have implications for risk assessment models and management planning for eastern forests as mountain pine beetle continues to expand its range.Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectClimatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectThe climate of the Tatra Mts. is warming and the cryosphere is shrinking.Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectThe mountain cryosphere is the most sensitive to the winter weather conditions.Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectInterannual variation of ice deposits in the mountains may not be synchronous.Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectTrends of regional ice deposits reflect variation in changes in the global climate system.Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectThis paper concerns the response of the conditioned by orography cryosphere of the non-glaciated mountains of mid-latitude to the climate impulses. It presents the relationships among the air temperature, precipitation, snow cover, lake ice cover, firn-ice patches (glacierets) and permafrost in the Tatras. The data from the warmest multi-year in the history of the local meteorological measurements and statistical models (multiple regression) have been used. The results indicate that all the components of the contemporary cryosphere are very sensitive to the changes in the air temperature in winter or snow precipitation/accumulation. Due to the diverse orographic conditions, interannual variability of seasonal and perennial, surface and subsurface ice deposits in the mountain areas may not be synchronous. However, the long-term trends of this variability reflect the changes in the global climate system.Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Symmetric mountain pass lemma and sublinear elliptic equations - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we study the p-Laplace elliptic equations under the Dirichlet boundary condition. We give a general and weak sufficient condition for the existence of a sequence of solutions converging to zero. This result is proved by applying the symmetric mountain pass lemma obtained in our earlier paper. For some elliptic equations with parameters, we decide whether the zero solution is an accumulation point or an isolated point in the set of all solutions.Symmetric mountain pass lemma and sublinear elliptic equations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectFurther analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectAccurate estimation of natural precipitation is important for accurate estimation of cloud seeding impact.Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectSensitivity of cloud seeding impact to external factors identifiedFurther analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectSpatial variability of cloud seeding impact identifiedFurther analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectConsistent cloud seeding impacts found over two independent experimentsFurther analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectThe first phase of the Snowy Precipitation Enhancement Research Project (SPERP-1) was a confirmatory experiment on winter orographic cloud seeding (Manton et al., 2011). Analysis of the data (Manton and Warren, 2011) found that a statistically significant impact of seeding could be obtained by removing any 5-hour experimental units (EUs) for which the amount of released seeding material was below a specified minimum. Analysis of the SPERP-1 data is extended in the present work by first considering the uncertainties in the measurement of precipitation and in the methodology. It is found that the estimation of the natural precipitation in the target area, based solely on the precipitation in the designated control area, is a significant source of uncertainty. A systematic search for optimal predictors shows that both the Froude number of the low-level flow across the mountains and the control precipitation should be used to estimate the natural precipitation. Applying the optimal predictors for the natural precipitation, statistically significant impacts are found using all EUs. This approach also supports a novel analysis of the sensitivity of seeding impacts to environmental variables, such as wind speed and cloud top temperature. The spatial distribution of seeding impact across the target is investigated. Building on the results of SPERP-1, phase 2 of the experiment (SPERP-2) ran from 2010 to 2013 with the target area extended to the north along the mountain ridges. Using the revised methodology, the seeding impacts in SPERP-2 are found to be consistent with those in SPERP-1, provided that the natural precipitation is estimated accurately.Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectSurface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectDead foliage is supported in the canopy briefly following severe disturbance.Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectSurface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectAccumulation of surface fuel loadings do not increase substantially in a decade.Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectHeavy fuel loads do not accumulate in a decade following fire/insect disturbance.Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectSurface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Simulation Training in the Extreme: Simulation-based Training in a Mountain Weather Chamber - ScienceDirectHelicopter Emergency Medical Service Simulation Training in the Extreme: Simulation-based Training in a Mountain Weather Chamber - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ongoing Cerebral Vasculitis During Treatment of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever - ScienceDirectRocky Mountain spotted fever is a tickborne infection that produces a systemic small-vessel vasculitis; its prognosis is excellent if appropriate treatment is initiated early.

ScienceDirectNew approach to resolve the amount of Quaternary uplift and associated denudation of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands - ScienceDirectLow-temperature thermochronology is a widely used tool for revealing denudation histories of mountain ranges. Although this technique has been applied mainly to continental orogens, such as the European Alps, Himalayas, and Andes, recent technological development of low-temperature thermochronology has made it applicable to a wider variety of mountain ranges with various sizes and tectonic histories. The Japanese Islands comprise young and active island arcs, where an early stage of mountain range formation is observed. Numerous attempts have been made to constrain the uplift and denudation histories of the mountains in the Japanese Islands using geologic, geomorphologic, or geodetic methods. However, the number of thermochronometric attempts has been limited primarily due to the small amount of total denudation since the initiation of the uplift. In this review paper, we introduce the tectonic and geomorphic settings of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands, and discuss previous attempts to estimate uplift or denudation of the Japanese mountains using methods other than thermochronology. Furthermore, we discuss problems of the thermochronometric applications in revealing denudation histories of the Japanese mountains. Finally, we present a case study of the Kiso Range in central Japan and discuss the current effectiveness and applicability of low-temperature thermochronology to the Japanese mountainous areas.New approach to resolve the amount of Quaternary uplift and associated denudation of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (355KB)Download full-size imageNew approach to resolve the amount of Quaternary uplift and associated denudation of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectSnow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectWe analysed debris flows events and snow avalanches in the High Tatras Mts.Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectDendrogeomorphic dating of 189 scarred trees with seasonal precision was applied.Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirect19 snow avalanches and eight debris flow since 1959 were dated.Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectSnow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectSnow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands - ScienceDirectImpacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands - ScienceDirectManagement intensification practices are expanding in mountain hay meadows.Impacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands - ScienceDirectExperimental irrigation and fertilisation were tested on ground-dwelling arthropods.Impacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands - ScienceDirectGround beetle and spider abundance increased up to different thresholds.Impacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands - ScienceDirectGround beetle and spider species richness was not affected.Impacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands - ScienceDirectStretching out the Australasian microtektite strewn field in Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains - ScienceDirectStretching out the Australasian microtektite strewn field in Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessing the impacts of climatic change on mountain water resources - ScienceDirectAs the evidence for human induced climate change becomes clearer, so too does the realization that its effects will have impacts on numerous environmental and socio-economic systems. Mountains are recognized as very sensitive physical environments with populations whose histories and current social positions often strain their capacity to accommodate intense and rapid changes to their resource base. It is thus essential to assess the impacts of a changing climate, focusing on the quantity of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow and ice melt represent a large streamflow component as well as a local resource in terms of freshwater supply, hydropower generation, or irrigation. Increasing evidence of glacier retreat, permafrost degradation and reduced mountain snowpack has been observed in many regions, thereby suggesting that climate change may seriously affect streamflow regimes. These changes could in turn threaten the availability of water resources for many environmental and economic systems, and exacerbate a range of natural hazards that would compound these impacts. As a consequence, socio-economic structures of downstream living populations would be also impacted, calling for better preparedness and strategies to avoid conflicts of interest between water-dependent economic actors. This paper is thus an introduction to the Special Issue of this journal dedicated to the European Union Seventh Framework Program (EU-FP7) project ACQWA (Assessing Climate Impacts on the Quantity and Quality of WAter), a major European network of scientists that was coordinated by the University of Geneva from 2008 to 2014. The goal of ACQWA has been to address a number of these issues and propose a range of solutions for adaptation to change and to help improve water governance in regions where quantity, seasonality, and perhaps quality of water may substantially change in coming decades.Assessing the impacts of climatic change on mountain water resources - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectGeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectNew dataset of images with known camera poses in mountainous terrain is introduced.GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectThe images in the dataset are accompanied by additional synthetic data and images.GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectA semi-automatic approach for the dataset acquisition is proposed.GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectBaseline evaluation of visual localization and orientation estimation is presented.GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectWe introduce a new dataset called GeoPose3K1 which contains over three thousand precise camera poses of mountain landscape images.

Mountain forests contribute in mitigating these hazards, in particular rockfalls. Assessing the protective effect of a forest against rockfall is a difficult task for both forest managers and rockfall experts. Accurate and simple tools are therefore required to efficiently evaluate the level of protection that results from the presence of forest.Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectThis study defines three novel indicators to quantify the protective effect of forests against rockfalls, regarding (1) the reduction of the frequency of rockfalls, (2) the reduction of their maximum intensity, and (3) the combination of the reduction of the frequency and the energy of the rocks. The first two indicators are relevant for rockfall experts whereas the third is mostly interesting for foresters as it summarizes the protective effect of forest. The Rockyfor3D model was adapted and used to simulate rockfalls propagation on 3886 different forest stands located in all the French Alps. The results of the simulations were used to calculate the three indicators for each forest stand. Finally, the relations between the forest structures and compositions and the indicators values were investigated.Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectOur principal result shows that only three forest characteristics are required to accurately predict the indicators and evaluate the protective level of a forest against rockfall. The two first variables correspond to the basal area and the mean diameter at breast height (DBH) of the forest stand which are two parameters commonly used by forest managers. The third characteristic is the length of forest in the maximum slope direction which can be computed with a geographic information system (GIS). The method proposed in this study is easily reproducible and is suitable to evaluate the protective effect of European mountain forests at different scales. At local scale, the proposed indicators can enrich rockfall studies in which forests are usually set aside to simplify the evaluation. Moreover, the indicators may find direct applications with foresters by allowing them to identify the protective level of their forest and consequently to adapt their management. Finally, the indicators are convenient to perform spatial analysis and produce maps of the protective effect of mountain forests that could find many applications in land settlement or evaluation of ecosystem services.Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (430KB)Download full-size imageNovel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.History and archaeology of the emblematic argan tree in the medieval Anti-Atlas Mountains (Morocco) - ScienceDirectHistory and archaeology of the emblematic argan tree in the medieval Anti-Atlas Mountains (Morocco) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectRecent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectClimate influences on whitebark pine mortality were geographically consistent.Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectRecent outbreaks were linked to warmer winter temperatures only in colder regions.Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectFuture climate suitability for outbreaks increases only in colder regions.Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectRecent mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests have been extensive and severe. Understanding the climate influences on these outbreaks is essential for developing management plans that account for potential future mountain pine beetle outbreaks, among other threats, and informing listing decisions under the Endangered Species Act. Prior research has focused on one geographic region, but geographic variability in beetle and tree physiological responses to climate conditions have been documented. Here we evaluate geographic variability in climate influences on recent beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine and estimate future climate suitability for outbreaks across much of the range of whitebark pine in the western US. To accomplish these objectives, we developed and analyzed statistical models for three different geographic regions as well as a Westwide model, then applied the Westwide model to a suite of climate projections. The general patterns of climate-tree mortality relationships were similar across the three regions of our study. However, the relative importance of individual climate metrics preceding and during the recent outbreaks varied geographically because of the different climates in the regions. Winter minimum temperatures appeared to be limiting prior to outbreaks in the colder regions. All regions experienced low summer precipitation prior to or during outbreak initiation. Future climate suitability for beetle outbreaks is estimated to increase or remain stable in the coldest regions and decline slightly in the warmest region by the end of this century. Across the study area, projections of higher winter temperatures and decreased summer precipitation (with lower confidence than for temperatures) contribute to increased climate suitability for outbreaks, while projected higher fall/spring/summer temperatures contribute to decreased suitability. Some regional variability exists; in particular, the effect of winter warming is muted in the warmest region (Cascades) where winter temperatures appear to be less limiting. However, all regions are projected to experience fewer years with very low suitability, which commonly occurred prior to the recent outbreaks and may have limited beetle populations. Given the inherent uncertainty in climate projections and ecological responses to novel climates, management plans that incorporate sites that are expected to experience a range of expected future climate conditions might increase the chances of whitebark pine persistence in a warmer future.Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab?

These habitats may be of inorganic origin, such as the rocky substratum associated with the river bed, or organic such as macroscopic algae. The objective of this study was to determinate the importance of five species of algae that differ in their morphological type as a substratum and food resource regarding the associated establishment of macroinvertebrate assemblages taking account the climatic seasonality (warm dry, cool dry and rainy). We then evaluate the differences in macroinvertebrates assemblages with respect to the inorganic substratum by sampling high mountain rivers in central Mexico. The mucilaginous colonies of Nostoc parmelioides and Placoma regulare, the pseudoparenchymatous bambusiform thallus of Paralemanea mexicana and the laminate thallus of Prasiola mexicana had the highest densities of macroinvertebrates, represented by the genera Cricotopus, Paramerina, Simulium and Tanytarsini tribe. The relationship between algal morphological type and the richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates was positively related to specific conductivity, total dissolved solids and discharge variables. The dominant taxa associated with the inorganic substratum belonged mainly to the Trichoptera, Diptera and Ephemeroptera orders. Water temperature, discharge and concentration of orthophosphates were the main environmental variables able to explain the diversity of macroinvertebrates on this substratum. The dominance of detritivorous macroinvertebrates in these mountain rivers suggests the contribution of allochthonous organic matter possibly of anthropogenic origin. The assemblages of macroinvertebrates on inorganic substratum did not significantly differ among sites or climatic seasons.Habitat preferences in freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates: Algae as substratum and food resource in high mountain rivers from Mexico - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Phylogenetic pattern of alpine plants along latitude and longitude in Hengduan Mountains Region - ScienceDirectTo detect the horizontal pattern of phylogenetic structure shown by alpine plants, we measured phylogenetic structure using net related index (NRI) and net nearest taxon index (NTI), and analyzed the phylogenetic structure patterns of alpine plants along longitude, latitude and environmental gradients in the Hengduan Mountains Region (HDMR). Our results show that: 1) the phylogenetic structure tended to cluster with increasing latitude and longitude; 2) for NRI, latitude was closer related than longitude, while for NTI, longitude was closer related than latitude, though they both not significantly relate to NTI. The phylogenetic structure tended towards overdispersion in the southern HDMR, with good climate conditions of higher mean annual temperature and more mean annual precipitation. In contrast, with harsh climate conditions of lower mean annual temperature and less mean annual precipitation, the increasing environmental stress led to phylogenetic clustering in the northern HDMR. The results highlighted that in the alpine region of HDMR, environmental filters and geographical isolation had a great effect on the latitudinal and longitudinal alpine species distribution, respectively.Phylogenetic pattern of alpine plants along latitude and longitude in Hengduan Mountains Region - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Editorial Office of Plant Diversity.Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectLarge wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectWood budgets and transport diagrams established for four study catchmentsLarge wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectLandslides and debris flows were dominant recruitment processes in headwater streams.Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectBank erosion predominated in the lower part of mountain riversLarge wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectEstimated deadwood contribution of 12%Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectLarge wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Holocene climate reconstruction based on herbaceous phytolith indices from an AMS 14C-dated peat profile in the Changbai Mountains, northeast China - ScienceDirectHolocene climate reconstruction based on herbaceous phytolith indices from an AMS 14C-dated peat profile in the Changbai Mountains, northeast China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Pleistocene Mountain Glaciation in the Lake Bonneville Basin - ScienceDirectLate Pleistocene Mountain Glaciation in the Lake Bonneville Basin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Level of minerals and trace elements in the urine of the participants of mountain ultra-marathon race - ScienceDirectLevel of minerals and trace elements in the urine of the participants of mountain ultra-marathon race - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectFreshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectWe investigated aquatic and semi-aquatic lichens associated with mountain streams.Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectThe second multivariate analysis of freshwater lichen community data in Europe is provided.Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectDiversity and small-scale distribution patterns of lichens were driven by duration of contact with water (hydrological zones).Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectFreshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectClimate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectWe analyse the altitude and aspect of glacial cirques in Britain and Ireland.Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectData indicate that moisture availability regulated sites of glacier initiation.Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectClimatic patterns during glacier initiation were similar to present.Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectWe map glacial cirques, and analyse spatial variability in their altitude and aspect to derive a long-term, time-integrated, perspective on climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation (likely spanning multiple Quaternary glaciations) in Britain and Ireland. The data reveal that, although air temperatures were important, exposure to moisture-bearing air masses was the key factor in regulating sites of former mountain glacier formation, and indicate that during such periods, moisture supply was largely controlled by North Atlantic westerlies, with notable inland precipitation gradients (precipitation decreasing inland), similar to present day. In places, trends in cirque altitude may also reflect regional differences in the extent of cirque deepening, controlled by the dimensions and dynamics of the glaciers that came to occupy them. Specifically, comparatively deep cirques in coastal locations may reflect the former presence of dynamic (fed by moisture from the North Atlantic), but comparatively small, glaciers (largely confined to their cirques). By contrast, decreasing cirque depth further inland, may reflect the former presence of larger and/or less dynamic ice masses, occupying comparatively continental climatic conditions.Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectLate Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectLate Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectThe geomorphic surfaces in the Bogda northern piedmont area are divided.Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectLate Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectLate Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectAre sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectGlobal review of sackung-type DSGSDsAre sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectFirst 10Be exposure dating of sackung in the CarpathiansAre sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectComparison of sackungen originated in paraglacial and non-glaciated landscapesAre sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectCritical reassessment of the relevancy of sackungen in the paraglacial geomorphologyAre sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectAre sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectTree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectThe consistently dominant climatic factor of tree-ring growth in Tianshan Mountains is verified.Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectTree rings provide three century climate records: precipitation, SPEI and PDSI.Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectHistorical change characteristic of moisture since A.D. 1882 is explored.Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectPossible variability driving mechanism of moisture is revealed.Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectThe western Tianshan Mountains are a very important source of water. The area is dominated by westerly winds and is important in global change research. In this paper, we combine two tree-ring width chronologies, meteorological data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), a standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) to analyze radial growth response to climate. Studies show moisture from the previous July to current June was consistently the dominant climatic factor accounting for interannual variation of tree-ring width in the western Tianshan Mountains. Then, we reconstruct the precipitation, SPEI and PDSI, and the three series are verified with mathematical methods and other observation data. Power spectral and wavelet analyses reveal significant 2- to 6-year high-frequency cycles and a 17-year low-frequency cycle. Moisture has varied as four wetter periods and four drier periods over the past century. We show that over all northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, moisture change has been rarely consistent. From the 1980s to present, the climate has had the longest, most significant and rapid wetting period in the past century. The moisture variability pertains to most areas of the western Tianshan Mountains, especially the northern slope of the mountains in Kyrgyzstan. Our results indicate a strong negative relationship between the Summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) and moisture in the western Tianshan Mountains. The moisture variability may have been controlled by the SNAO in the past century, and may be associated with large-scale oscillation in the climate system.Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectValue-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectNo-management generates high ES utilities for three out of four ES.Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectSmall-scale silviculture combines timber production and biodiversity conservation well.Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectAll analysed managements can be considered as multifunctional.Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectValue-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectOrigin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectFluorite occurs as lenses/veins in a number of localities in the Nuba Mountains.Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectFluorite is classified into four categories based on their petrography.Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectIt exhibits a relatively high concentration of rare earth elements (REE).Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectREE doesn't occur in the fluorite structure but rather as independent mineral(s).Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectOrigin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectAmong other mineralizations in the basement complex of the Nuba Mountains, fluorite occurs as lenses and veins in a number of localities.

Water diversions throughout the Rocky Mountains transport large volumes of water out of the basins of origin, resulting in hydrologic modifications to downstream areas. This study examines the hypothesis that lodgepole pine located below water diversions exhibit an increased incidence of mountain pine beetle infestation and mortality. A ground survey verified diversion structures in a portion of Grand County, Colorado, and sampling plots were established around two types of diversion structures, canals and dams. Field studies assessed mountain pine beetle infestation. Lodgepole pines below diversions show 45.1% higher attack and 38.5% higher mortality than lodgepole pines above diversions. These findings suggest that water diversions are associated with increased infestation and mortality of lodgepole pines in the basins of extraction, with implications for forest and water allocation management.Mountain pine beetle infestation of lodgepole pine in areas of water diversion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectMountain terrestrial/freshwater ecosystems provide insights into the effects of global changeAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectSnow cover duration affects soil C/N cycling and alpine ibex population dynamicsAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectClimate change induces an increase in vegetation cover in grasslands and C uptake in forestsAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectClimate drives change in water chemistry, lake thermal dynamics and plankton phenologyAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectIncreased data comparability and standardized protocols at different LTER sites are advisableAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectMountain ecosystems are sensitive and reliable indicators of climate change.

We analyzed a set of key climate parameters, such as temperature and snow cover duration, in relation to vascular plant species composition, plant traits, abundance patterns, pedoclimate, nutrient dynamics in soils and water, phenology and composition of freshwater biota.Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectThe overall results highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems to climate change, with site-specific characteristics and rates. As temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits increased as well. Years with limited snow cover duration caused an increase in soil temperature and microbial biomass during the growing season. Effects on freshwater ecosystems were also observed, in terms of increases in solutes, decreases in nitrates and changes in plankton phenology and benthos communities. This work highlights the importance of comparing and integrating long-term ecological data collected in different ecosystems for a more comprehensive overview of the ecological effects of climate change. Nevertheless, there is a need for (i) adopting co-located monitoring site networks to improve our ability to obtain sound results from cross-site analysis, (ii) carrying out further studies, in particular short-term analyses with fine spatial and temporal resolutions to improve our understanding of responses to extreme events, and (iii) increasing comparability and standardizing protocols across networks to distinguish local patterns from global patterns.Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (161KB)Download full-size imageAssessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectJoint first authors.Is acute mountain sickness related to trait anxiety?

This study used advanced statistics to examine how diversity and species composition of beetle communities depend on vegetation pattern and environmental factors along an ecological gradient from steppe to desert. Our study included the beetle families Tenebrionidae, Carabidae, Curculionidae, and Coccinellidae, which account for the majority of the known beetle fauna in the area. The most abundant Coleoptera in all plots were Harpalus limbaris, Corsyra fusula, and Anatolica cellicola; otherwise, we caught a large number of rare species. The beta diversity of communities was correlated with distance between plots. Species richness of beetles was positively impacted by plant cover and correlated negatively with rising temperatures, whereas Shannon diversity of beetle communities was significantly higher in areas with higher precipitation. Distribution and community composition of Coleopterans were governed by environmental factors, especially plant diversity, mean annual temperature, and summer precipitation, as revealed by redundancy analysis.Coleoptera in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia): species richness and community patterns along an ecological gradient - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA).The formation of mountain range curvature by gravitational spreading - ScienceDirectThis paper presents a mechanism by which mountain ranges can form curved range-fronts. Gravitational spreading of mountain ranges that have been thrust onto rigid lowlands will result in the formation of curvature, provided that enough gravity-driven flow occurs to dominate the shape of the topography. Whether this mechanism can operate during the lifetime of a given mountain range depends upon the viscosity of the range, the square of the along-strike length of the range, and the cube of the elevation of the range. The curvature of the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau is consistent with formation by gravitational spreading provided that the viscosity is similar to that previously estimated using other, independent, methods. The low elevation and young age of the Zagros mountains mean that large-scale curvature has not had time to develop. The short along-strike extent and possibly low viscosity of the Sulaiman Ranges in Pakistan may have allowed the ranges to form their distinctive arcuate shape. The formation of range-front curvature plays an important role in controlling the tectonic evolution of the interiors of the ranges, with arc-parallel extension becoming progressively more important as range-front curvature develops.The formation of mountain range curvature by gravitational spreading -

Distribution and community composition of Coleopterans were governed by environmental factors, especially plant diversity, mean annual temperature, and summer precipitation, as revealed by redundancy analysis.Coleoptera in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia): species richness and community patterns along an ecological gradient - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA).Effects of ecological engineering on water balance under two different vegetation scenarios in the Qilian Mountain, northwestern China - ScienceDirectThe Qilian Mountain, northwestern China.Effects of ecological engineering on water balance under two different vegetation scenarios in the Qilian Mountain, northwestern China - ScienceDirectEffects of ecological engineering on water balance under two different vegetation scenarios in the Qilian Mountain, northwestern China - ScienceDirectAfter the ecological engineering, water yield and soil water content experienced an increment of 32%, and 46%. The opposite trend was monitored in runoff and evapotranspiration, which decreased by 48% and 4%, respectively. Therefore ecosystem restoration have increased soil water retention capacity, a greater proportion of precipitation reaching the catchment is absorbed by the soil rather than flowing out of the region as runoff. Therefore trade-offs between environmental sustainability and water resources security should be carefully addressed in arid region that experienced severe water shortages.Modelling Soil Erodibility in Mountain Rangelands of South-Western Kyrgyzstan - ScienceDirectThe main objective of this study was to map soil erodibility in the mountainous rangelands of Kyrgyzstan. The results of this effort are expected to contribute to the development of soil erodibility modelling approaches for mountain areas. In this case study we map soil erodibility at two sites, both representing grazing rangelands in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan and having potentially different levels of grazing pressure.Modelling Soil Erodibility in Mountain Rangelands of South-Western Kyrgyzstan - ScienceDirectWe collected a total of 232 soil samples evenly distributed in geographical and feature space. Then we analyzed the samples in a laboratory for grain size distribution and calculated soil erodibility values from these data using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) K-factor formula. After that we derived different terrain indices and ratios of frequency bands from ASTER DEM and LANDSAT images to use as auxiliary data because they are among the main soil forming factors and widely used for prediction of various soil properties. Soil erodibility meaningfully correlated with channel network base level (geographically extrapolated altitude of water channels), remotely sensed indices of short-wave infrared spectral bands, exposition and slope. We applied multiple regression analysis to predict soil erodibility from spatially explicit terrain and remotely sensed indices. The final soil erodibility model was developed using the spatially explicit predictors and the regression equation and then improved by adding the residuals.Modelling Soil Erodibility in Mountain Rangelands of South-Western Kyrgyzstan - ScienceDirectThe spatial resolution of the model was 30 meters and the estimated mean adjusted coefficient of determination was R2 = 0.47. The two sites indicated different estimated and predicted means of soil erodibility values (0.035 and 0.039) with 0.95 significance level, which is attributed mainly to the considerable difference in elevation.Modelling Soil Erodibility in Mountain Rangelands of South-Western Kyrgyzstan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Clouds and Precipitation Associated with Hills and Mountains - ScienceDirectClouds and Precipitation Associated with Hills and Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Clouds and Precipitation Associated with Hills and Mountains - ScienceDirectCase study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectCase study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectCommercial sheep flock under extensive grazing on Cantabrian mountain grasslands.Case study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectCorrelation between lipids in mountain plants to those present in sheep diet, raw milk and cheese.Case study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectTerpenoid, tocopherol and fatty acid composition of main pasture plants prevailed in the sheep diet.Case study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectBotanical and lipid composition of mountain pasture determined milk and cheese lipids.Case study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectCase study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Case study of a commercial sheep flock under extensive mountain grazing: Pasture derived lipid compounds in milk and cheese - ScienceDirectCo-corresponding author.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectGround beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectGround beetle assemblages were studied to determine the effects of passive restoration of a mountain river.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectSix unmanaged and six channelized cross-sections were compared.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectBeetle assemblages in unmanaged cross-sections were more abundant and richer in species.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectActive river zone width was a good predictor of the composition of beetle assemblages.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectRestoring dynamic processes improved the condition of ground beetles over a few years.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectEffects of passive restoration of mountain rivers on the organisms inhabiting exposed riverine sediments are considerably less understood than those concerning aquatic biota. Thus, the effects of a recovery of the Raba River after abandonment of maintenance of its channelization scheme on ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) communities were investigated by comparing 6 unmanaged cross-sections and 6 cross-sections from adjacent channelized reaches. In each cross-section, ground beetles were collected from 12 sampling sites in spring, summer, and autumn, and 8 habitat parameters characterizing the cross-sections and sampling sites were determined. Within a few years after abandonment of the Raba River channelization scheme, the width of this gravel-bed river increased up to three times and its multi-thread pattern became re-established. Consequently, unmanaged river cross-sections had significantly larger channel width and more low-flow channels and eroding cutbanks than channelized cross-sections. Moreover, sampling sites in the unmanaged cross-sections were typified by significantly steeper average surface slope and larger average distance from low-flow channels than the sites in channelized cross-sections. In total, 3992 individuals from 78 taxa were collected during the study. The ground beetle assemblages were significantly more abundant and richer in species in the unmanaged than in the channelized cross-sections but no significant differences in carabid diversity indices between the two cross-section types were recorded. Redundancy Analysis indicated active river zone width as the only variable explaining differences in abundance and species richness among the cross-sections. Multiple regression analysis indicated species diversity to predominantly depend on the degree of plant cover and substrate grain size. The study showed that increased availability of exposed sediments in the widened river reaches allowed ground beetles to increase their abundance and species richness within a few years after the onset of river restoration, but more time may be needed for development of more diverse carabid communities.Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (245KB)Download full-size imageIdentifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectIdentifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectThe distribution of SOM had a strong directional character in the mountainous areas.Identifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectHigher correlation between SOM and factors was at large scale than at small scale.Identifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectCorrelation at large scale was consistent with original series before scale separation.Identifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectAA and DWT can identify SOM distribution and control factors at various scales.Identifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectTerrain factors and climate factors are mainly responsible for SOM spatial variation.Identifying scale-specific controls of soil organic matter distribution in mountain areas using anisotropy analysis and discrete wavelet transform - ScienceDirectAnimal, Microbial, and Fungal Borne Skin Pathology in the Mountain Wilderness: A Review - ScienceDirectMountains are home to numerous organisms known to cause skin disease.

Beside the loss of glaciers as attractive landscape features, climate change will also lead to changes in environmental conditions due to increasing subsurface temperatures, increasing slope instability and mass movements, and will increase the likelihood of further glacial retreat. In order to study the risk perception and expected behaviour of mountain tourists, we used a web-based questionnaire including a choice experiment with a tour choice. The results show that risk taking is influenced by three main factors: 1) the experience, frequency of participation and commitment, 2) the perception of risky environmental conditions, and 3) the individual risk-related trade-off including information, the desired experience and other given constraints such as time management or weather conditions. A latent class analysis of the choice experiment revealed two distinct groups of participants: the experienced and the casual mountain tourists. The two distinct classes showed different risk behaviour and behavioural intentions with respect to the three main influencing factors. Perceptions of climate change and its possible effects on the alpine environment did not influence choices.Risk perception and preferences of mountain tourists in light of glacial retreat and permafrost degradation in the Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectThis study highlights four critical aspects that need to be considered by tourist destinations and Alpine Clubs providing services to mountain tourists and outdoor recreationists. Three aspects are crucial:Risk perception and preferences of mountain tourists in light of glacial retreat and permafrost degradation in the Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectTwo classes can be distinguished according to their reaction to increasing risk in the mountains. Casual mountain tourists are more likely to avoid tours with increasing risks such as rock fall, whereas experienced mountain tourists are more tolerant of such risks.Risk perception and preferences of mountain tourists in light of glacial retreat and permafrost degradation in the Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectCuriously, neither class was at all affected by a lack of information about the potential for rock fall. This may indicate that all types of tourists, consider a lack of information to mean little risk. Therefore up to date information is crucial.Risk perception and preferences of mountain tourists in light of glacial retreat and permafrost degradation in the Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectCasual mountain tourists are attracted by the experience of untouched and unspoiled nature and less by the challenges of high mountainous areas or the improvement of technical skills. Therefore, this group is more affected by changes in the trail system due to rock fall, debris flow or other impacts and more likely to choose other destinations in the future.Risk perception and preferences of mountain tourists in light of glacial retreat and permafrost degradation in the Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectA prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectApatite grains in Kumukol Basin were dated by using (U-Th)/He technique.A prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectA prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectThe ages of the detritals represent their original ones in the provenance region.A prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectA prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectA prolonged Cenozoic erosional period in East Kunlun (Western China): Constraints of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages on the onset of mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (182KB)Download full-size imageRocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Children - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectAn ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectGroundwater resources quantitatively evaluated by finite difference method.An ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectComplex correlations investigated by the correlation equation and hierarchy process analysis methods.An ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectInteractions among precipitation and groundwater depth and their contributions to ecological quality.An ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectGroundwater exploitation threshold computed with optimal management model.An ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectAn ecology-oriented exploitation mode of groundwater resources in the northern Tianshan Mountains, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Is restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectIs restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectLimbo subjects had the highest restless legs syndrome (RLS) severity score.Is restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectChronic mountain sickness (CMS) subjects had the lowest oxygen saturation and the highest hematocrit values.Is restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectO2 saturation, sleep quality, and Quinghai score of >5 were associated with RLS.Is restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectRLS could be an early clinical manifestation of hypoxia at high altitudes.Is restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectHigh-altitude dwellers could be a good model to study the role of hypoxia in RLS.Is restless legs syndrome associated with chronic mountain sickness? - ScienceDirectRestless legs syndrome (RLS) and chronic mountain sickness (CMS) share physiological traits.

Georgia nestled between the Black Sea, Russia, and Turkey, and surrounded by the Caucasus Mountains, occupies a unique geographic space, which gives it strategic importance far beyond its size. Though blessed by its rich hydro resources, Georgia due to its uneven distribution, experiences some problems as the demand on water frequently doesn't coincide with water provision. As a result it causes acute deficit situation. Due to the global warming of the climate, it is expected that the fresh water amount will decrease in Georgia. This is why it is necessary to approach the use of water resources in a complex way by means of water reservoirs, which will enable attaining of a large economic effect. In the mountainous conditions filling of reservoirs take place in spring time, when snow and glaciers melt. In Georgia as in mountainous country, abundant rains take place, thus causing catastrophic flooding on rivers. In summer and winter water amount decreases 10 times and irrigation, water provision and energy production is impeded. Thus, the lack of water just like the excess amount of water causes damage. This is why it is needed to forecast water amount in water reservoirs for different periods of the year. But in a complex, mountainous terrain operative data of hydrometeorology is not sufficient for application of modern mathematical methods. We have elaborated multiple-factor statistical model for a forecast, which by means of different mathematical criteria and methods can simultaneously research the increase of the timeliness of forecasts and the level of their precision. We have obtained methodologies for short and long term forecasts of inflowing water properties in Georgia's main water reservoirs to further plan optimally and regulate water resources and their unimpeded and safe exploitation.Reservoirs on the mountain rivers and their safety - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Journal Annals of Agrarian Science.Embryo mountain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectEarthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectAn integrated method is presented to study seismic responses of building clusters.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectThe integral type of GZB constitutive equations with history variables is adopted.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectSurface topography of viscoelastic earth medium and fault rupture are considered.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectBuilding clusters are composed of plane frame structures.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectSeismic responses of building clusters in near-fault mountain city can be studied.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectA new algorithm is proposed to implement viscoelastic wave propagation in earth medium with surface topography by introducing history variables into integral type GZB constitutive equations and by using the recursive formulae of these history variables. Combining the proposed algorithm with the flexural wave algorithm for frame structure and the algorithm for bidirectional wave propagation, a new type of integrated method is developed for earthquake response analyses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city due to rupture of causative fault. The earthquake responses of building clusters of frame structures situated at different sites of a mountain in Chongqing city, China, are studied during a hypothetical Mw 6.2 near-fault earthquake. The numerical results show that, for the multi-story buildings, the maximum peak value of beam-end bending moments appears in the building on the hill top and the earthquake risk positions are mainly at the bottom and/or the top of the buildings. For the high-rise buildings, the maximum peak value of beam-end bending moments appears in the building on the mountainside and the earthquake risk positions are mainly at the bottom and/or the middle of the buildings.Tree-ring evidence for the historical cyclic defoliator outbreaks on Larix potaninii in the central Hengduan Mountains, SW China - ScienceDirectTree-ring evidence for the historical cyclic defoliator outbreaks on Larix potaninii in the central Hengduan Mountains, SW China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fingerprints of anthocyanins and flavonols of Vaccinium uliginosum berries from different geographical origins in the Greater Khingan Mountains and their antioxidant capacities - ScienceDirectFingerprints of anthocyanins and flavonols of Vaccinium uliginosum berries from different geographical origins in the Greater Khingan Mountains and their antioxidant capacities - ScienceDirectVaccinium uliginosum in Greater Khingan Mountains was systematically investigated firstly.Fingerprints of anthocyanins and flavonols of Vaccinium uliginosum berries from different geographical origins in the Greater Khingan Mountains and their antioxidant capacities - ScienceDirectBioactive component content in the peels was positively correlated with latitude.Fingerprints of anthocyanins and flavonols of Vaccinium uliginosum berries from different geographical origins in the Greater Khingan Mountains and their antioxidant capacities - ScienceDirectBerries from locations L15 and L14 were distinguished by their higher TAC and TFC.Fingerprints of anthocyanins and flavonols of Vaccinium uliginosum berries from different geographical origins in the Greater Khingan Mountains and their antioxidant capacities - ScienceDirectFingerprints of anthocyanins and flavonols of Vaccinium uliginosum berries from different geographical origins in the Greater Khingan Mountains and their antioxidant capacities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectGeographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectMountain risk and disaster management.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectNatural hazards.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectTorrent and avalanche cadaster.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectHazard zones.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectGeographic information system.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectMountain risk and disaster management (MRDM) and natural hazards are in alpine countries a national task. Natural hazards in alpine spaces are represented by floods, avalanches, landslides, rock falls and debris flows. MRDM is a very complex system which includes many technical and administrative components. MRDM is based on legal acts and regulations enforced by different federal political levels and departments. A big desire of all involved participants in MRDM is to get simple solutions in this complexity. Austrian Service for Torrent and Avalanche Control has to keep a TAC. With the support of geographic information systems (GIS) it was possible to create a digital TAC. The digital TAC is diverted into different modules: torrent areas, avalanche areas, hazard zone maps, etc. Each module has its own character, but act also interactive. In view of data security TAC has no public access. For public information supply objects can be exported from digital TAC. Only when technical and legal work of an object is correct it can be send through a data tunnel to WebGIS portals with permanent public access for further public use. This paper gives a basic insight into digital TAC supported by GIS which is used in the offices of Austrian Service for Torrent and Avalanche Control.Geographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageGeographic information systems in mountain risk and disaster management - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Early to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectEarly to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectThe sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology of the Lower to Middle Jurassic strata in the Bogda area were studied.Early to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectThere was difference uplift between the eastern and western Bogda area during Jurassic times.Early to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectThe episodic uplift of Eastern Bogda Mountains was related to the tectonic evolution of the CAOB during Jurassic times.Early to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectThe Bogda Mountains, as an important intracontinental orogenic belt, are situated in the southern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and are a key area for understanding the Mesozoic evolution of the CAOB. However, the tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains remains controversial during the Mesozoic Era, especially the Early to Middle Jurassic Periods. The successive Lower to Middle Jurassic strata are well preserved and exposed along the northern flank of the Western Bogda Mountains and record the uplift processes of the Bogda Mountains. In this study, we analysed sedimentary facies combined with detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology at five sections of Lower to Middle Jurassic strata to detect the tectonic evolution and changes of provenance in the Bogda area. During Early to Middle Jurassic times, the fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine environments dominated in the western section of the Bogda area. The existence of Early Triassic peak age indicates that the Bogda Mountains did not experience uplift during the period of early Badaowan Formation deposition. The Early Triassic to Late Permian granitoid plutons and Carboniferous volcanic rocks from the Barkol and Santanghu areas were the main provenances. The significant change in the U-Pb age spectrum implies that the Eastern Bogda Mountains initiated uplift in the period of late Badaowan Formation deposition, and the Eastern Junggar Basin and the Turpan-Hami Basin were partially partitioned. The Eastern Bogda Mountains gradually became the major provenance. From the period of early Sangonghe to early Toutunhe Formations deposition, the provenance of the sediments and basin-range frame were similar to that of late Badaowan. However, the Eastern Bogda Mountains suffered intermittent uplift three times, and successive denudation. The uplifts respectively happened in early Sangonghe, late Sangonghe to early Xishanyao, and late Xishanyao to early Toutunhe. During the deposition stage of Toutunhe Formation, a relatively strong tectonic reactivation took place along the Late Palaeozoic Bogda rift belt accompanied by relatively large-scale magmatism. The distinct basement structure between the eastern and western Bogda rift could be the structure basis of difference uplift in the Bogda area during the Mesozoic Era. The Early to Middle Jurassic episodic uplift of Eastern Bogda Mountains perhaps was related to the post-collisional convergence of the Qiangtang Block from late Badaowan to early Sangonghe, the closure of the western Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean at the Early-Middle Jurassic boundary and the tectonic accretion at the south Asian margin of Pamir Block during late Middle Jurassic times.Early to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (187KB)Download full-size imageEarly to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains, Northwest China: Evidence from sedimentology and detrital zircon geochronology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of disturbances and climate on high-mountain Norway spruce forests in the Low Tatra Mts., Slovakia - ScienceDirectInfluence of disturbances and climate on high-mountain Norway spruce forests in the Low Tatra Mts., Slovakia - ScienceDirectDisturbances formed various stand structures and modified climate-growth relationship.Influence of disturbances and climate on high-mountain Norway spruce forests in the Low Tatra Mts., Slovakia - ScienceDirectRadial increments and release potential of Norway spruce increased after 1990.Influence of disturbances and climate on high-mountain Norway spruce forests in the Low Tatra Mts., Slovakia - ScienceDirectIn high-mountain conditions, construction of regional boundary line is recommended.Influence of disturbances and climate on high-mountain Norway spruce forests in the Low Tatra Mts., Slovakia - ScienceDirectInfluence of disturbances and climate on high-mountain Norway spruce forests in the Low Tatra Mts., Slovakia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Timing of last deglaciation in the Cantabrian Mountains (Iberian Peninsula;

However, due to the shortcomings of existing optimization theories and the complexity of rock masses, optimizing the smooth blasting parameters in arbitrary geological conditions with specified control indices is challenging. Eighteen on-site smooth blasting experiments were conducted during the construction of the long Foling highway tunnel in China. These experimental data were used as the training samples for machine learning. By training these samples, an improved support vector regression (ISVR) model was proposed to map the relation between the inputs, comprising the geological conditions (the basic quality [BQ] grade of the rock mass, saturated uniaxial compression strength of rock, and overburden depth) and control indices and the outputs of the smooth blasting parameters, including the spacing of perimeter holes and relief holes, minimum burden and linear charge concentration of perimeter holes. A genetic algorithm (GA) was coupled with an ISVR algorithm to automatically search the optimal parameters of the ISVR model during the training process. Using the ISVR model, the optimization of smooth blasting parameters can be obtained based on certain geological conditions of surrounding rock and specified control indices, including the crown settlement, thickness of the blasting damage zone (BDZ) in which the travelling velocity of ultrasonic waves is reduced significantly due to explosive vibration, volume of overbreak or underbreak, and radial decoupling ratio. According to the application results of the Foling tunnel, the ISVR model was shown to be superior since it can outperform certain existing models. As geological conditions and control indices are comprehensively considered, the proposed ISVR model of smooth blasting parameters is expected to be more feasible and reliable and is thus recommended for use in similar tunnel projects.Optimization of smooth blasting parameters for mountain tunnel construction with specified control indices based on a GA and ISVR coupling algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Improvised Cricothyrotomy on a Mountain Using Hiking Gear - ScienceDirectWe present a case of a 57-year-old man who fell while climbing a mountain in California and sustained severe facial trauma. Three firefighters and 2 emergency physicians witnessed the fall and resuscitated the patient. The patient ultimately required a surgical cricothyrotomy performed with a pocket knife and Platypus hydration pack. The physicians made a makeshift positive pressure airway device using the Platypus hydration pack. We believe this is the first case report describing an improvised cricothyrotomy performed in the wilderness using only hiking gear. This report also discusses indications for cricothyrotomy, the challenges of resuscitation in a low-resource environment, and special considerations in a high-altitude setting.Improvised Cricothyrotomy on a Mountain Using Hiking Gear - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Improvised Cricothyrotomy on a Mountain Using Hiking Gear - ScienceDirectSubmitted for publication April 2016.Improvised Cricothyrotomy on a Mountain Using Hiking Gear - ScienceDirectAccepted for publication August 2016.Migraine Headache Confounding the Diagnosis of Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectA 36-year-old man with a history of migraine headache attempted to hike from Lukla, Nepal, to Mount Everest Base Camp. On the sixth day of hiking, he had a migraine headache. After achieving resolution with typical therapies and rest, he ascended higher. Another headache developed that was interpreted to be a migraine. The headache was treated, and he ascended higher, after which severe symptoms of acute mountain sickness developed, necessitating his evacuation by helicopter. Persons with headaches in daily life may present challenges to diagnosis when traveling to high altitude. Careful evaluation and decision making are needed to achieve proper diagnosis and treatment of acute mountain sickness.Migraine Headache Confounding the Diagnosis of Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stable isotopes of river water and groundwater along altitudinal gradients in the High Himalayas and the Eastern Nyainqentanghla Mountains - ScienceDirectStable isotopes of river water and groundwater along altitudinal gradients in the High Himalayas and the Eastern Nyainqentanghla Mountains - ScienceDirectData are the first to document isotopic composition of water in Sagarmantha National Park, including Mt.

The laterites formed as a result of prolonged weathering of the ophiolitic assemblage under tropical to subtropical conditions.Genesis and mineralogical classification of Ni-laterites, Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectGenesis and mineralogical classification of Ni-laterites, Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectA significant enrichment in Ni and Co occurred as a result of the lateritization process. Ni concentrations average 0.63% (Ibra), 0.72% (3 profiles, East Ibra), 0.67% (3 profiles, Al-Russayl), and 0.33% (2 profiles, Tiwi). Electron microprobe analyses showed that goethite, chlorite, kaolinite, serpentine and talc are the main Ni-bearing minerals. This study showed that the Ibra, East Ibra and Tiwi laterites are similar to the other hydrous Mg-silicates (type A) Ni deposits, where nickel-bearing talc (willemseite) or chlorite, and serpentine (nepouite, chrysotile, and antigorite) are the main constituents. Al-Russayl laterite is however, similar to the oxide type (Type C), where most likely the nickel is included in the oxyhydroxides (mainly goethite) minerals.Genesis and mineralogical classification of Ni-laterites, Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectZircon rims reveal different geological histories of both tectonic units;The evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectThe presented data are the first direct dating of ocean crust formation in the eastern prolongation of the Tornquist Ocean, which formed a probable link to the Paleoasian Ocean.The evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (162KB)Download full-size imageThe evolution of Eastern Tornquist-Paleoasian Ocean and subsequent continental collisions: A case study from the Western Tatra Mountains, Central Western Carpathians (Poland) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Theory of turn bodies of mountain tandem wheeled self-propelled chassis - ScienceDirectThe theory of turning of the adaptive bodies of mountain tandem-wheeled motor vehicle chassis intended as power units in small farms, is offered.

This report describes a unique case of recovery in an austere environment that involved explosives. In June 2012, a 52-year-old man ascended a cliff tower in the Eastern Alps, Italy. A landslide occurred, and a boulder crushed the climber against a large stone located farther down the cliff, causing compression of the lower limbs and the pelvis with consequent severe musculoskeletal trauma. The National Alpine and Cave Rescue Unit (NACRU) arrived and proceeded with stabilization of the injured climber, which took 6 hours and involved a difficult extrication supported by the Cave Rescue division of NACRU. Unfortunately, during transport to the trauma center of Borgo Trento, Verona, the patient exhibited signs of progressive traumatic shock because of crush syndrome, hypovolemia, and acidosis, which led to cardiac arrest and death. Based on an extensive literature review, this report was determined to be the only one of a mountain rescue using explosives for the extrication of a victim in the Northeast Italian Alps. This case describes how a rescue in austere environments can represent a high-risk situation, and it shows how improvisation and cooperation between rescue teams are crucial for a successful recovery.Complex Alpine Extrication: Case Report of Mountain and Speleological Rescue Cooperation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complex Alpine Extrication: Case Report of Mountain and Speleological Rescue Cooperation - ScienceDirectDeep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in a Mountain Guide: Awareness, Diagnostic Challenges, and Management Considerations at Altitude - ScienceDirectDeep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in a Mountain Guide: Awareness, Diagnostic Challenges, and Management Considerations at Altitude - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Environmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectEnvironmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectAn LCA was performed on 16 small-scale dairy farms in mountain areas.Environmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectOrganic and conventional breeding methods were compared.Environmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectDifferent functional units and allocation methods were applied.Environmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectEnvironmental impact of farms changed if ecosystem services were accounted for.Environmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectConsidering farm multi-functionality, GWP per kg of milk was reduced.Environmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectEnvironmental assessment of small-scale dairy farms with multifunctionality in mountain areas - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of topography on vertical velocity of air in relation to severe storms near the Southern Andes Mountains - ScienceDirectThe influence of topography on vertical velocity of air in relation to severe storms near the Southern Andes Mountains - ScienceDirectTwo structures of vertical air velocity are observed above the Mendoza Andes region.The influence of topography on vertical velocity of air in relation to severe storms near the Southern Andes Mountains - ScienceDirectIn two case studies the mountain wave amplitudes are able to trigger convection.The influence of topography on vertical velocity of air in relation to severe storms near the Southern Andes Mountains - ScienceDirectA simple conceptual scheme linking the dynamical factors is proposed.The influence of topography on vertical velocity of air in relation to severe storms near the Southern Andes Mountains - ScienceDirectOn the basis of 180 storms which took place between 2004 and 2011 over the province of Mendoza (Argentina) near to the Andes Range at southern mid-latitudes, we consider those registered in the northern and central crop areas (oases). The regions affected by these storms are currently protected by an operational hail mitigation project. Differences with previously reported storms detected in the southern oasis are highlighted. Mendoza is a semiarid region situated roughly between 32S and 37S at the east of the highest Andes top. It forms a natural laboratory where different sources of gravity waves, mainly mountain waves, occur. In this work, we analyze the effects of flow over topography generating mountain waves and favoring deep convection. The joint occurrence of storms with hail production and mountain waves is determined from mesoscale numerical simulations, radar and radiosounding data. In particular, two case studies that properly represent diverse structures observed in the region are considered in detail. A continuous wavelet transform is applied to each variable and profile to detect the main oscillation modes present. Simulated temperature profiles are validated and compared with radiosounding data. Each first radar echo, time and location are determined. The necessary energy to lift a parcel to its level of free convection is tested from the Convective Available Potential Energy and Convection Inhibition. This last parameter is compared against the mountain waves' vertical kinetic energy. The time evolution and vertical structure of vertical velocity and equivalent potential temperature suggest in both cases that the detected mountain wave amplitudes are able to provide the necessary energy to lift the air parcel and trigger convection. A simple conceptual scheme linking the dynamical factors taking place before and during storm development is proposed.The influence of topography on vertical velocity of air in relation to severe storms near the Southern Andes Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Flint as raw material in prehistoric times: Cantabrian Mountain and Western Pyrenees data - ScienceDirectCurrently, investigations about siliceous resources exploited during prehistoric times in the Cantabrian Mountain and Western Pyrenees are still scarce and, generally, they did not employ methods which go deeply into the provenance characteristics.Flint as raw material in prehistoric times: Cantabrian Mountain and Western Pyrenees data - ScienceDirectA review of the studies of lithic resource exploitation offered by historiography indicates that the theme has been examined in a generalized way in most cases. A model with a clear difference between the Eastern and Western territory of the Cantabrian Coast was created: an area with flint and an area without flint. This model needs to be qualified, because in recent years siliceous outcrops have been discovered in zones of the Western Cantabrian Mountains (Asturias). Information from the investigations in the Cantabrian Mountains, Basque-Cantabrian Basin, and Western Pyrenees indicates diverse patterns. There is a preference for lithic raw material found near the occupations, together with the inclusion of exotic or distant flints, always of good quality, to a greater or lesser extent, according to the chronological periods and the geographical location.Flint as raw material in prehistoric times: Cantabrian Mountain and Western Pyrenees data -

ScienceDirectThe growth of mountain hemlock trees in Pacific North America demonstrates a complex relationship to two or more seasonal environmental variables. In order to examine the radial growth response of mountain hemlock to subseasonal climate variables, ring-width and X-ray densitometric analyses were used to construct intra-annual dendroclimatic records. The intent was to highlight the difference between the dendroclimatic outcomes of standard ring-width analyses to those derived from density chronologies collected at high elevation locations in the British Columbia Coast Mountains. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tree-ring parameters to better define the complex growth behaviour in mountain hemlock trees for the construction of more robust proxy climate records. Tree-ring chronologies from three sites were used to describe the inherent climate-growth trends. Maximum tree-ring density values provided a robust data series for constructing site-specific proxy records of late-summer temperature. Annual ring-width measurements provided independent proxies of spring snowpack trends. Significant decreases in temperature and an increase in snowpack depth during the early 1700s and early 1800s coincides with documented PDO phases and Little Ice Age glacier advances. Identification of early and late growing season climate signals within mountain hemlock trees demonstrates the value of documenting the characteristics of multiple tree ring parameters in future dendroclimatic studies.A dendroclimatic analysis of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) ring-width and maximum density parameters, southern British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A dendroclimatic analysis of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) ring-width and maximum density parameters, southern British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 250 877 3427.Herders in the mountains and farmers in the plains? A comparative evaluation of the archaeobiological record from Neolithic sites in the eastern Iberian Pyrenees and the southern lower lands - ScienceDirectMountain sites are usually seen as sites connected to pastoral or transhumant activities. This paper proposes an alternative interpretation for Neolithic mountain sites found in the southern Pyrenean slopes. The archaeobotanical and archaeozoological record of highland and lowland sites from this region is compared in order to observe any differences in crop and animal husbandry. Available data indicate that mountain sites present a similar record to the one observed in the lowlands. Most sites show clear evidence of permanent activity, including agriculture, as well as other practices connected to medium- to long-term strategies like storage of plant products. We propose that more integrated analyses are needed in this and other regions to fully characterize mountain economy during the Neolithic, since no clear evidence of pastoralism or transhumance has been found.Herders in the mountains and farmers in the plains?

Available records also document a variable lake response in terms of hydrology and productivity, with a decrease in sedimentation rates and organic productivity in most high altitude lakes and increases in salinity and relatively lower lake levels at lower altitudes. The impact of the Younger Dryas on the coastal environment was almost negligible, but it was responsible for a brief cessation in sea level rise. High-resolution analyses of new speleothem records have documented a double structure for the YD with an earlier drier phase followed by a relatively more humid period.Mountain glacier evolution in the Iberian Peninsula during the Younger Dryas - ScienceDirectThe review of geomorphological evidence demonstrates a strong latitudinal control of glacial activity during the YD, with more intense development in the northern than in the southern regions.

Existing literature, however, often focuses on single measures without considering that policies are usually bundles of different measures addressing multiple non-marketed goods and services. Thus, interaction effects of a set of policies in a given policy mix may influence the cost-effectiveness of single measures. Recently, Swiss agricultural policy was redesigned using the Tinbergen rule as its basis, i.e., a single measure for each policy goal, including additional targeted direct payments. This facilitates testing for interaction effects of multiple targeted AEMs. Here we use a social-ecological, agent-based modelling framework to assess interaction effects of these agricultural policies while accounting for climate change impacts in our analysis. The results from our case study in a mountain region show that ecosystem service provision increases with targeted payments. However, interaction effects of the different targeted policies affect the provision levels of all goods and services. In particular, changes at the extensive margin, i.e., the total amount of land that is under production, largely determine the amount of ecosystem services provided. Thus, climate change driven productivity increases and policies that keep land in production may substantially support the provision of non-marketed goods and services in marginal agricultural production regions with a high potential for land abandonment. Consequently, the effectiveness of targeted policy measures should also consider changes at the extensive margin and be assessed in the context of bundles or portfolios of different policy measures.Interaction effects of targeted agri-environmental payments on non-marketed goods and services under climate change in a mountain region - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Origin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectOrigin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectGypsum extruded along major thrust fault between Neo-Tethyan allochthon and Cenozoic sediments.Origin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectContains exotic clasts of quartz-rich sandstone exposed in neither hangingwall nor footwall.Origin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectGypsum 87Sr/86Sr ratios are inconsistent with depositional ages of regional evaporite intervals.Origin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectModels based on Eo-Cambrian and Cenozoic gypsum sources, with the former preferred.Origin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectOrigin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (157KB)Download full-size imageOrigin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Origin and implications of a thrust-bound gypsiferous unit along the western edge of Jabal Sumeini, northern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectDr. David Cooper is a consultant geologist focusing on the stratigraphic, sedimentological and structural evolution of Neo-Tethyan margins, in particular in Oman and the UAE.

These demands make managing mountain forests a challenging task, involving manifold synergies and conflicts between the different ES. There is therefore an urgent need for appropriate concepts and tools for support decisions in forest management and planning (FMP) to take into consideration all ES and to manage the wide variety of information types, parameters and uncertainties involved in assessing the sustainability of ES. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a suitable set of methods for sustainability evaluations. In this study sustainability means the persistent fulfilment of the required ES. To address all the phases of the FMP process, MCDA and forest models should be applied together, with indicators providing the main interfaces to combine them. This paper aims to: i) review assessment approaches in order to select appropriate and widely accepted indicators for measuring and assessing the effects of different silvicultural management alternatives on forest ES, and ii) present additional standardisation approaches (value functions) for each indicator. Standardisations are necessary to make the different ES comparable and to study synergies and trade-offs between different management objectives in MCDA. The main ES in central European mountain regions are considered, with a clear focus on those indicators that are directly derivable from forest model outputs and that can refer to sustainable forest management practices. The scales considered are that of the single forest stand and of the larger forest management unit. A holistic indicator-based analysis framework for FMP in mountain forests can be built using the indicators and value functions described. The influence of different management alternatives on ES can then be evaluated, taking into consideration the instruments and information on forest management (forest models, inventory) available. All indicators are selected according to existing and approved approaches that only require data that is normally available in operational forest management. The framework can thus be an important element in developing a decision support system for FMP in mountain forests.Management of ecosystem services in mountain forests: Review of indicators and value functions for model based multi-criteria decision analysis -

ScienceDirectUnderstanding the effects of forest management on biodiversity is a vital challenge given the current regime of large-scale socio-ecological drivers affecting forest ecosystems and their multifunctionality. Here we assessed how forest management affects abundances of common breeding birds in mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Ram. ex DC) stands in the Pyrenees. We assessed, at guild level, avian response to changes in stand structure across different management stages in forests managed under a shelterwood system, as well as in unmanaged forests. Bird guilds were based on habitat breadth, nesting habitat, and foraging habitat. Bird abundance was modelled separately for each guild as a function of stand variables known to be good surrogates of stand density (stand density, quadratic mean diameter, shrub cover) and maturity (dominant height, cavities). For this purpose, we used likelihood methods, which provided flexibility in the shape of the expected responses. For most bird guilds, unmanaged forests showed similar bird abundance to managed forests. Total bird abundance was maximum after regeneration cuts, due to the positive response of canopy nesters and canopy foragers. The typical open stand structure after removal cuts negatively impacted forest specialists, cavity nesters and trunk foragers, but the impact was offset by the higher number of generalists, ubiquitous, ground nesters and ground foragers. General stand descriptors such as stand density, quadratic mean diameter and dominant height were the most influential variables, whereas the association of bird abundance with shrub cover and cavities was less influential and guild-specific. We show that a shelterwood system can be a suitable management tool to promote the abundance of most common bird guilds in dense, homogeneous stands, given that some key structural legacies are retained throughout the rotation and stand structure heterogeneity is promoted. By obtaining quantitative relationships between the main structural features affected by harvests and the abundance of birds, we formulate management recommendations that are valid for forests managed not only under shelterwood systems but also under other silvicultural methods.Bird community response in mountain pine forests of the Pyrenees managed under a shelterwood system - ScienceDirectCo-first authors.CO2 emission of tourist transportation in Suan Phueng Mountain, Thailand - ScienceDirectInstitutional impacts on the resilience of mountain grasslands: an analysis based on three European case studies - ScienceDirectInstitutional impacts on the resilience of mountain grasslands: an analysis based on three European case studies - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydroclimatic changes over the past 900 years documented by the sediments of Tiewaike Lake, Altai Mountains, Northwestern China - ScienceDirectHydroclimatic changes over the past 900 years documented by the sediments of Tiewaike Lake, Altai Mountains, Northwestern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectGeological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectOxidation of rock-derived organic carbon (OCpetro) examined using dissolved rhenium in rivers.Geological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectDissolved rhenium flux in Taiwan is positively correlated with sediment yield.Geological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectPhysical erosion sets the rate of OCpetro oxidation in river catchments.Geological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectCO2 release by OCpetro oxidation < CO2 drawdown by recent organic carbon burial.Geological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectErosion and weathering in Taiwan result in a net sink of organic carbon.Geological respiration of a mountain belt revealed by the trace element rhenium - ScienceDirectCombined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectCombined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectWe explored the combined effects of pollution and climate on insect herbivory.Combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectLeaf-eating insects demonstrated variable responses to both these factors.Combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectInsect herbivory levels did not depend on the level of environmental disturbance.Combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectTemporal changes in herbivory differed between pristine and disturbed forests.Combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectStability of insect-plant interactions decreased in habitats disturbed by pollution.Combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectCombined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (142KB)Download full-size imageInsect damage to mountain birch leaves was unchanged along the gradient of pollution-induced environmental disturbance (left), but temporal stability of this damage (inverse of the coefficient of variation) decreased with an increase in disturbance (right).Combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate warming on insect herbivory in mountain birch in subarctic forests: Results of 26-year monitoring - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical Estimation of Brown Bears (Ursus arctos L.) Population in the Rhodope Mountains - ScienceDirectThe brown bear (Ursus arctos L.) is the most widespread bear in the world. It can be found across Europe, Asia and North America in habitats ranging from forests to dry deserts and tundra. One of the best natural habitats of brown bears (Ursus arctos L.) in Europe are located in Bulgaria. They are situated in the mountain massifs: The Rhodopes, Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, and Vitosha. The species is a strictly protected and the Nature protection act declared areas for conservation of its habitats. That is why it is important to estimate the population size of brown bears and how this population is changed in the country during the years. In this work we study the population of brown bears in the Rhodope Mountains, using statistical data received from the National monitorings which were carried out in autumn 2011 and 2012. The observed data during the National monitorings are incomplete and contains some uncertainties. Here we suggest some approaches to resolve this problem and obtain a satisfactory estimate of the brown bear population in The Rhodopes. The suggested approaches can be applied to estimate the population of the species in the other mountain massifs.Inhaled Budesonide and Oral Dexamethasone Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectThis double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate inhaled budesonide and oral dexamethasone compared with placebo for their prophylactic efficacy against acute mountain sickness after acute high-altitude exposure.Inhaled Budesonide and Oral Dexamethasone Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectInhaled Budesonide and Oral Dexamethasone Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectInhaled Budesonide and Oral Dexamethasone Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectInhaled Budesonide and Oral Dexamethasone Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectThis is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).Inhaled Budesonide and Oral Dexamethasone Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness - ScienceDirectFunding: This study was supported by the Special Health Research Project, Ministry of Health of P.R.

ScienceDirectTemporal changes in the ice sheet hydrological system indicate variations in the ice sheet dynamics.Subglacial conditions and Scandinavian Ice Sheet dynamics at the coarse-grained substratum of the fore-mountain area of southern Poland - ScienceDirectThe fore-mountain areas of southern Poland are locally composed of the coarse-grained sediments of alluvial fans, which created unusual conditions under the advancing Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Elsterian glaciation. This highly permeable substratum potentially enabled rapid outflow of meltwater from the ice sheet base, thereby reducing the water pressure and strongly influencing the ice sheet dynamics. The subglacial conditions and the relationship between the ice sheet behaviour and its coarse-grained substratum were studied at the foreland of the western Carpathian Mountains. The sedimentological and structural analysis of the till and related sediments that were deposited above the alluvial gravel of the fore-mountain fans are presented.Subglacial conditions and Scandinavian Ice Sheet dynamics at the coarse-grained substratum of the fore-mountain area of southern Poland - ScienceDirectThe study indicates that despite the high permeability of the coarse-grained substratum, it did not slow the ice sheet movement. Conversely, the ice sheet moved mainly due to basal slip and locally shallow deformations. This was a consequence of very high basal water pressure, which resulted largely from the presence of permafrost that restricted subglacial groundwater outflow. In addition, the ice sheet substratum was inclined opposite to the direction of its movement, increasing the pressure of the subglacial water. Numerous subhorizontal sandy laminae within the till indicate that the meltwater from the ice sheet base was drained by a water film along the ice/bed interface. The water escape structures within the till and subtill sediments indicate the occasional instability of the ice sheet hydrological system and suggest that the meltwater was periodically stored in the ice sheet base. Temporal changes occurring in the ice sheet hydrological system might indicate variations in the ice sheet behaviour; i.e. phases of relatively fast ice flow and phases of ice stagnation. The latter were probably correlated with the freezing of the ice margin to its base. The study shows how the coarse-grained substratum could potentially influence ice sheet behaviour and provides a broader look on the factors controlling the dynamics of the Pleistocene ice sheets, which soft-sediment substrata in many areas were texturally varied.Subglacial conditions and Scandinavian Ice Sheet dynamics at the coarse-grained substratum of the fore-mountain area of southern Poland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Injuries In Mountain Bike Racing: Frequency of Injuries In Endurance Versus Cross Country Mountain Bike Races - ScienceDirectTo determine the frequency of injuries requiring medical attention among mountain bike racers at endurance races (6 hours or greater in duration) versus traditional cross country races (less than 6 hours duration) and to determine the medical support available at races.Injuries In Mountain Bike Racing: Frequency of Injuries In Endurance Versus Cross Country Mountain Bike Races - ScienceDirectA survey was developed to determine participants' experience level, previous injuries, and demographic information. An additional survey was completed by injured riders to determine injuries and treatment received. The number of medical providers, their level of training, and the supplies available was determined.Injuries In Mountain Bike Racing: Frequency of Injuries In Endurance Versus Cross Country Mountain Bike Races - ScienceDirectThe endurance riders had more years of mountain biking experience, averaged more hours of riding per week, and had fewer injuries requiring medical attention in the past year than the riders in the races. Of the cross-country riders, 7.2% were injured during the race, and 4.7% of endurance racers were injured. There was no increased risk of being injured in a race over an endurance race (odds ratio 1.6, 95% CI [0.50, 2.92]). Lacerations and abrasions were the most common injuries in both events. Head injuries, eye injuries, and blisters were only reported in the endurance events.

The Beijing Mountain study area contains the junction of two mountain ranges (the Yanshan Mountains and the Taihang Mountains). Tectonic activity has significantly influenced the drainage system and the geomorphic situation in the area, leading to a high probability of the development of debris flows, which is one of the major abrupt geological disasters in the region. Based on 30-m-resolution ASTER GDEM data, a total of 752 drainage basins were extracted using ArcGIS software. A total of 705 debris flow valleys were visually interpreted from ALOS satellite images and published documents. Seven geomorphic indices were calculated for each basin including the relief amplitude, the hypsometric integral, the stream length gradient, the basin shape indices, the fractal dimension, the asymmetry factor, and the ratio of the valley floor width to the height. These geomorphic indices were divided into five classes and the ratio of the number of the debris flow valleys to the number of the drainage basins for each geomorphic index was computed and analyzed for every class. Average class values of the seven indices were used to derive an index of relative active tectonics (IRAT). The ratio of the number of the debris flow valleys to the number of the drainage basins was computed for every class of IRAT. The degree of probable risk level was then defined from the IRAT classes. Finally, the debris flow hazard was evaluated for each drainage basin based on the combined effect of probable risk level and occurrence frequency of the debris flows. The result showed a good correspondence between IRAT classes and the ratio of the number of the debris flow valleys to the number of the drainage basins. Approximately 65% of the drainage basins with occurred debris flow valleys are at a high risk level, while 43% of the drainage basins without occurred debris flow valleys are at a high risk level. A comparison with results from past studies demonstrated that the accuracy of these findings is greater than 85%, indicating that the basin topography created by rapid tectonic deformations is more favorable for debris flows.Relative tectonics and debris flow hazards in the Beijing mountain area from DEM-derived geomorphic indices and drainage analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectLate Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectTwo parallel red clay-loess cores drilled from the Xiaoshuizi peneplain have been studied via magnetostratigraphy.Late Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectLate Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectThe geomorphological evolution history of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain since the Late Miocene-Pliocene is described.Late Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectThe onset of interior Asian aridification occurred at Late Miocene and was triggered by the rapid uplift of Tibetan Plateau.Late Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectLate Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Deadwood in Norway spruce dominated mountain forest reserves is characterized by large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages - ScienceDirectDeadwood in Norway spruce dominated mountain forest reserves is characterized by large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages - ScienceDirectDeadwood amount and quality assessment in 7 spruce dominated mountain forest reserves.Deadwood in Norway spruce dominated mountain forest reserves is characterized by large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages - ScienceDirectHigh deadwood volumes of advanced decay stages identified as typical features.Deadwood in Norway spruce dominated mountain forest reserves is characterized by large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages - ScienceDirectSpatial log distribution indicates that past storm events are an important factor for the found patterns.Deadwood in Norway spruce dominated mountain forest reserves is characterized by large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages - ScienceDirectDeadwood levels exceed values issued in national biodiversity policies.Deadwood in Norway spruce dominated mountain forest reserves is characterized by large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages - ScienceDirectDeadwood provides key habitats for a variety of forest species.

The agdal is probably Morocco's best example of such an institution. Nevertheless they have always existed within the context of change and currently are experiencing major transitions. Detailed ethnographic studies of the socio-ecological drivers of these processes of change in agdals are scarce. Based on the particular case of the agdal of Yagur in the Mountain Mesioui tribal territory (High Atlas of Morocco), this article will analyse contemporary transformations. These dynamics are inherent to small-scale societies' ICCAs, even if they have most often been described as isolated, autarchic and mutable only under external pressure. From the case of the agdal of Yagur, we show how non-local processes are only part of the picture, and that the transformation of agdal forms are also related to key internal drivers, entailing a greater degree of agency by local actors than is usually given in the literature. At the same time, placing our analysis within a broader social anthropological framing, we provide a detailed actor-centred analysis that situates agents and local power relations within their institutional and cultural context while explaining how these same micropolitics of natural resource management articulate with and within wider global scales.Multi-agentive transformations of rural livelihoods in mountain ICCAs: The case of the decline of community-based management of natural resources in the Mesioui agdals (Morocco) -

ScienceDirect"Familiness" of family tourism business has the potential of reducing seasonality effects in off-peak.Coping with seasonality: A case study of family owned micro tourism businesses in Obudu Mountain Resort in Nigeria - ScienceDirectSeasonality in tourism has attracted much attention from tourism management stakeholders due to the important role it plays in destinations sustainability. It is also recognised to have significant effects on tourism business survivability and sustainability. Despite this recognition, there has been a paucity of research on its effects on family owned micro tourism businesses and how they cope in tropical climate regions of developing countries. Using a qualitative research strategy, a total of 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with family members in micro tourism businesses in the host communities of Obudu Mountain Resort in Nigeria. The finding reveals that Obudu Mountain Resort and the existing family owned micro tourism businesses experiences extreme seasonality. This has serious effects on business operations and family survival as a majority of the operators depend solely on the businesses. Unlike the practice in the majority of the destinations located in temperate climate regions, all the family owned micro tourism businesses in Obudu Mountain Resort environment stay open throughout the year, regardless of the fall in tourists' flow in off-peak; adopting similar and varying coping strategies. Despite the challenges of off-peak periods, the "familiness" of family tourism business has shown to have the potential of reducing the effects of seasonality in rural peripheral tourist destination.Coping with seasonality: A case study of family owned micro tourism businesses in Obudu Mountain Resort in Nigeria - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Coping with seasonality: A case study of family owned micro tourism businesses in Obudu Mountain Resort in Nigeria - ScienceDirectMohammed Bala Banki is a lecturer in the Federal University of Technology Minna, Nigeria.

In this paper, twelve Gramineae species of the subfamilies Panicoideae, Pooideae and Arundinoideae from the Changbai Mountains were selected, and 3698 phytoliths were counted. We measured six parameters of dumbell, elongate, lanceolate, crenate, saddle and silicified stomata. The seven shape factors of different types of phytoliths were deduced by the six parameters measured above and analyzed by nonparametric testing and discriminant analysis.The shape factors of phytoliths in selected plants from the Changbai Mountains and their implications - ScienceDirectThe nonparametric testing indicated that the average value of the shape factor SF4 among the three subfamilies was obviously different. Discriminant analysis for the three subfamilies, also revealed that the discriminant accuracy was high (89.81%). Total discriminant accuracy using shape factors of dumbell phytoliths of Panicoideae was 73.12%. Discriminant accuracies using shape factors of elongate, lanceolate and crenate phytoliths of Pooideae were respectively 60.87, 59.21 and 87.07%. The discriminant accuracies using shape factors of saddle phytoliths and silicified stomata of Arundinoideae were 59.06 and 71.77%. At the same time, the shape factors of phytoliths from Setaria viridis and Leymus chinensis were used to test whether the discriminant functions established at the subfamily level were effective or not. Results showed discriminant functions precisely classify them, thus verified discriminant functions were useful. In conclusion, using the seven shape factors of phytoliths not only may improve the accuracy of classifying Gramineae, but also provides basis reference data for better understanding the presence and function of Gramineae plants at archaeological sites.The shape factors of phytoliths in selected plants from the Changbai Mountains and their implications - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Grazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectGrazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectWe assess feeding behaviour, diet selection and parasite level in grazing donkeys.Grazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectDonkeys showed a preference for herbaceous vegetation.Grazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectDespite this, donkeys can incorporate up to 30% of shrubs in their diet.Grazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectA relation between feeding behaviour and a natural parasite control is proposed.Grazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectParasite level increase was delayed in relation with existing information.Grazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectGrazing behaviour of Miranda donkeys in a natural mountain pasture and parasitic level changes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Improving mountain bike trails in Austria: An assessment of trail preferences and benefits from trail features using choice experiments - ScienceDirectOver the past two decades, mountain biking has emerged as an increasingly popular recreational activity. However, at least in Austria official trails do not necessarily match the preferences of bikers and therefore they often ride on unofficial trails or on trails where biking is not allowed. This behavior can result in conflicts with other trail users, landowners, hunters and conservationists. With data from an online choice experiment we confirm and extend results from previous studies on mountain biking, such as riders preferring technically challenging trails with lots of singletrack and vertical climb. However, the specific preferences depend on rider characteristics, especially experience and age. Through a simulation of market shares and the calculation of compensating surplus for riders in the study area in forests close to Vienna, we demonstrate how this research can provide insights about how to adjust trails to better match the interests of bikers while still respecting regulations which are in the interests of landowners, hunters and ecological concerns.Improving mountain bike trails in Austria: An assessment of trail preferences and benefits from trail features using choice experiments -

ScienceDirectWe used autecological, paleoecological, and modeling information to explore the potential effects of climate change on vegetation in the Blue Mountains ecoregion, Oregon (USA). Although uncertainty exists about the exact nature of future vegetation change, we infer that the following are likely to occur by the end of the century: (1) dominance of ponderosa pine and sagebrush will increase in many locations, (2) the forest-steppe ecotone will move upward in latitude and elevation, (3) ponderosa pine will be distributed at higher elevations, (4) subalpine and alpine systems will be replaced by grass species, pine, and Douglas-fir, (5) moist forest types may increase under wetter scenarios, (6) the distribution and abundance of juniper woodlands may decrease if the frequency and extent of wildfire increase, and (7) grasslands and shrublands will increase at lower elevations. Tree growth in energy-limited landscapes (high elevations, north aspects) will increase as the climate warms and snowpack decreases, whereas tree growth in water-limited landscapes (low elevations, south aspects) will decrease. Ecological disturbances, including wildfire, insect outbreaks, and non-native species, which are expected to increase in a warmer climate, will affect species distribution, tree age, and vegetation structure, facilitating transitions to new combinations of species and vegetation patterns. In dry forests where fire has not occurred for several decades, crown fires may result in high tree mortality, and the interaction of multiple disturbances and stressors will probably exacerbate stress complexes. Increased disturbance will favor species with physiological and phenological traits that allow them to tolerate frequent disturbance.Social-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectSocial-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectMountain forests can assist in reducing societal vulnerability of forest dependent communities.Social-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectA combined DPSIR-ES approach proved to be useful for identifying human responses.Social-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of perceptions reflecting on forest related decision-making has been untangled.Social-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectExpert evaluation of the FSES can assist in designing policy and practice measures to enhance sustainability.Social-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectSocial-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (192KB)Download full-size imageSocial-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a changing world - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectReforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectEvolution of snow avalanche damage is studied over a 215-year period.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectA synthetic damage index is created, mapping its variations over time and space.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectThe evolution of damage is closely related to human-induced changes in vegetation cover.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectDeforestation explains the concentration of damages in the late 19th century.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectChanges in land use management explain the decrease of the damage, mainly since the 1960s.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) - ScienceDirectNatural conditions that explain the triggering of snow avalanches are becoming better-known, but our understanding of how socio-environmental changes can influence the occurrence of damaging avalanches is still limited. This study analyses the evolution of snow avalanche damage in the Asturian Massif (NW Spain) between 1800 and 2015, paying special attention to changes in land-use and land-cover patterns. A damage index has been performed using historical sources, photointerpretation and fieldwork-based data, which were introduced in a GIS and processed by means of statistical analysis. Mapping allowed connecting spatiotemporal variations of damage and changes in human-environment interactions. The total number of victims was 342 (192 dead and 150 injured). Results show stability in the number of avalanches during the study period, but a progressive decrease in the damage per avalanche. Changes in land use explain the evolution of damage and its spatial/temporal behaviour. The role played by vegetation cover is at the root of this process: damage was the highest during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when a massive deforestation process affected the protective forest. This deforestation was the result of demographic growth and intensive grazing, disentailment laws and emerging coal mining. Since the mid-20th century, the transformation of a traditional land-management system based on overexploitation into a system based on land marginalization and reforestation, together with the decline of deforestation due to industrial and legal causes, resulted in the decrease of avalanches that affected settlements (mostly those released below the potential timberline). The decrease of damage has been sharper in the western sector of the Asturian Massif, where oak deforestation was very intense in the past and where lithology allows for a more successful ecological succession at present. Taking into account that reforestation can be observed in mountain environments of developed countries worldwide, and considering present initiatives conducted to counteract its negative cultural effects by means of grazing and clearing operations, planning is imperative, and this research provides useful information for environmental management policies and risk mitigation in avalanche prone areas.Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain) -

ScienceDirectPotentially harmful trace elements (PHTEs) do not accumulate homogeneously over mountainous area. Generally, highland areas receive more wet deposition, aerosols, and ions than surrounding lowlands ones, mainly due to orographic enhancement. Within mountainous areas, however, the accumulation of PHTEs is much more complex. Direct cloud deposition of contaminants could act as an important pathway of deposition either from a regional low-altitude, cloud level, orographic clouds, or haze whose frequency of occurrence is much higher than surrounding lowlands areas. The accumulation legacy of PHTEs from local human activities should also be considered when investigating PHTE distribution in mountainous areas. Combined with other phenomena, the PHTE accumulation patterns could be highly variable depending on local topography, dominant winds, and vegetation cover, as well as present and past local practices. Despite their remoteness, mountain ecosystems are highly sensitive to PHTEs loadings.Inorganic Chemistry in the Mountain Critical Zone: Are the Mountain Water Towers of Contemporary Society Under Threat by Trace Contaminants? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectLong-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectLong-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectBeech forests showed slow one-way dynamics compared to varied cyclic development in spruce.Long-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectLong-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectLong-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectK, Ca, Mg content had crucial role in soil in beech forests, respectively N content in spruce.Long-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectLong-term changes in vegetation and site conditions in beech and spruce forests of lower mountain ranges of Central Europe - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of dusty environment (Makka city broken mountains) on bronchial asthma - ScienceDirectIn the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of asthma was 12%, with vast regional variations ranging from less than 10% in Dammam to 23% in Hail.

There is increasing consensus about the importance of public perceptions of human well-being, but studies on this are still scarce. Here, we conducted 445 face-to-face interviews to assess subjective well-being across diverse respondents and landscapes in the Huailai mountain-basin system, China. The results suggest the actualization process of human well-being is similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We found that mental health was disregarded by most respondents, while basic material for a good life was most valued. Moreover, our results show differences of well-being across different socio-demographic and landscapes characteristics. Apart from good social relations, elderly respondents had highest levels of human well-being in all other four dimensions; respondents from mountainous land with a high level of ecological conservation had the lowest level of well-being. We discuss the factors contribution to well-being and its implications for local management and policies. Understanding the implications of respondents and landscapes characteristics on human well-being can help managers to develop efficient and specific policies.Perceptions of human well-being across diverse respondents and landscapes in a mountain-basin system, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceptions of human well-being across diverse respondents and landscapes in a mountain-basin system, China - ScienceDirectBojie Wang is a Ph.D. student at College of Resource and Technology, Beijing Normal University.

As a consequence, rescue operations are increasing, especially for trauma and polytrauma victims. The outcome of such patients depends greatly on the duration of the prehospital stabilization. Limited medical training of mountain rescuers may adversely affect the outcome of patients. There is no study investigating high altitude trauma treatment. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) principles in mountain trauma, and to discuss a possible role of ATLS in mountain medicine education programs.Effect of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) on the Time Needed for Treatment in Simulated Mountain Medicine Emergencies - ScienceDirectEffect of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) on the Time Needed for Treatment in Simulated Mountain Medicine Emergencies - ScienceDirectIn 4 of the 5 tasks (airway, breathing, circulation, and combination), the ATLS group completed the task significantly faster.

Due to high PM concentration, haze days impacting ambient visibility have occurred frequently in this region. Besides visibility impairment, PM pollution also causes a negative impact on public health. These negative impacts have heightened the need to improve our understanding of the PM pollution of the PRD region. One major cause of the PRD pollution problem is cold front passages in the winter; however, the mechanism of pollution formation stays unclear. In this study, the Comprehensive Air Quality Model (CAMx) is utilized to investigate the detailed PM production and transport mechanisms in the PRD.Enhancement in secondary particulate matter production due to mountain trapping - ScienceDirectSimulated concentrations of PM2.5 species, which have a good correlation with observation, show that sulfate and nitrate are the dominant pollutants among different PM2.5 species. Before the cold front passage a large amount of gas-phase and particle-phase pollutants are transported to the mountainous regions in the north of the PRD, and become trapped by the terrain. Over the mountain regions, cloud driven by upwelling flow promotes aqueous-phase reactions including oxidations of PM precursors such as SO2 and NO2. By this process, production of secondary PM is enhanced. When the cold front continues to advance further south, PM is transported to the PRD cities, and suppressed into a thin layer near the ground by a low planetary boundary layer (PBL). Thus high PM concentration episodes take place in the PRD cities.Enhancement in secondary particulate matter production due to mountain trapping - ScienceDirectAfter examining production and transportation pathways, this study presents that the complex terrain configuration would block pollutant dispersion, provide cloudy environment, and advance secondary PM production. Previous studies have pointed out that pollution emitted from outside this region largely influences the air quality in the PRD; however, this study shows that pollutants from the outside could be originated from the PRD and transported back resulting in significant increase of secondary PM concentration, and provides new insight into PM production and transport mechanism in the PRD.Enhancement in secondary particulate matter production due to mountain trapping - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic exhumation of the southeastern margin of Coastal Mountains, SE China, revealed by fission-track thermochronology: Implications for the topographic evolution - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous-Cenozoic exhumation of the southeastern margin of Coastal Mountains, SE China, revealed by fission-track thermochronology: Implications for the topographic evolution - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry.Factors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectFactors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectInbreeding in EMD increased slowly but constantly after the 2nd World war.Factors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectThe average inbreeding level for an extant EMD is around 40%.Factors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectFinal GLMMs explain around one third of variance of litter size at birth and at registration.Factors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectPuppy losses were less frequent in larger litters from older parents.Factors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectInbreeding development should be monitored and breeding restrictions should be chosen carefully.Factors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectFactors influencing litter size and puppy losses in the Entlebucher Mountain dog - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Catastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectCatastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectThe Heart Mountain landslide is the largest known sub-aerial landslide on Earth.Catastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectEmplacement mechanism has been under dispute for 100 yr.Catastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectExperimental results show that the emplacement was catastrophic.Catastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectShear heating at high slip velocities cause thermal decomposition.Catastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectCatastrophic slip was aided by carbonate decomposition and release of CO2.Catastrophic emplacement of giant landslides aided by thermal decomposition: Heart Mountain, Wyoming - ScienceDirectHydrogeochemical characteristics of spring water in the Harz Mountains, Germany - ScienceDirectHydrogeochemical characteristics of spring water in the Harz Mountains, Germany - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Potential effects of climate change on riparian areas, wetlands, and groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the Blue Mountains, Oregon, USA - ScienceDirectRiparian areas, wetlands, and groundwater-dependent ecosystems, which are found at all elevations throughout the Blue Mountains, comprise a small portion of the landscape but have high conservation value because they provide habitat for diverse flora and fauna. The effects of climate change on these special habitats may be especially profound, due to altered snowpack and hydrologic regimes predicted to occur in the near future. The functionality of many riparian areas is currently compromised by water diversions and livestock grazing, which reduces their resilience to additional stresses that a warmer climate may bring. Areas associated with springs and small streams will probably experience near-term changes, and some riparian areas and wetlands may decrease in size over time. A warmer climate and reduced soil moisture could lead to a transition from riparian hardwood species to more drought tolerant conifers and shrubs. Increased frequency and spatial extent of wildfire spreading from upland forests could also affect riparian species composition. The specific effects of climate change will vary, depending on local hydrology (especially groundwater), topography, streamside microclimates, and current conditions and land use.Transference of 3D accelerations during cross country mountain biking - ScienceDirectTransference of 3D accelerations during cross country mountain biking - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Soil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectSoil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectSoil mesofauna and litter species clearly impact the litter decomposition.Soil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectThe effect of interactions of soil mesofauna and litter species on litter decomposition is not significant in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains.Soil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectThe interactions of the mesofauna and their local environment play an important role in the linkages between ecosystem function and biodiversity.Soil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectThere is a relationship between the composition of the mesofauna assemblages and their contribution to litter mass loss.Soil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectSoil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition in the coniferous forest of the Changbai Mountains, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Integration of aspect and slope in snowmelt runoff modeling in a mountain watershed - ScienceDirectIntegration of aspect and slope in snowmelt runoff modeling in a mountain watershed - ScienceDirectThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51069017) and the International Collaborative Research Program of Xinjiang Science and Technology Commission (Grant No. 20126013).Integration of aspect and slope in snowmelt runoff modeling in a mountain watershed - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Hohai University.Uppermost Pliensbachian-Lowermost Toarcian ostracod assemblages from the Western Tethys: Comparison between Traras Mountains (Algeria), Subbetic (Spain), and Algarve (Portugal) - ScienceDirectMajor changes in ostracod assemblages have been recorded in the Lower Jurassic of Western Tethys related to biotic crises of the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary and the Polymorphum-Levisoni boundary (Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event). The study is focused on the ostracods assemblages from Benzerka section (Traras Mountains, Algeria) and their comparison with sections from External Subbetic and Algarve Basin (South Iberian Palaeomargin). Three stratigraphic intervals coincident with the ammonite zones have been differentiated with important fluctuations in the composition of ostracod assemblages. In the ostracod assemblages from the Traras Mountains the turnover related to this benthic biotic crisis is shown by assemblages previous to the biotic crisis (uppermost Pliensbachian) mainly composed by families Healdiidae and Cytherellidae to assemblages just after the T-OAE (upper part of the Levisoni Zone) with assemblages dominated by families Protocytheridae and Polycopidae and the extinction of family Healdiidae (suborder Metacopina). The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) probably resulted in restricted conditions but a barren interval due to oxygen-depleted conditions in this setting is not recorded. In this context, the change of components of ostracod assemblages looks gradual. In the Southiberian Palaeomargin, represented by the External Subbetic the turnover of ostracods assemblages is also recorded but the families involved are different than in Traras Mountains. Therefore, different phases have been differentiated in the ostracod turnover occurring from Upper Pliensbachian (assemblages dominated by families Pontocyprididae, Healdiidae and Bairdiidae) to end of Lower Toarcian (assemblages dominated by family Cytherellidae and the extinction of family Healdiidae). In the Algarve Basin the families Healdiidae and Bairdiidae were dominant previously to the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event. Differences in the composition of ostracod assemblages between Traras Mountains and External Subbetic may be related to the fragmentation of these palaeomargins related to early stages of rifting in the Western Tethys. Moreover, the incidence of oxygen-depleted conditions was higher in External Subbetic than in Traras Mountains where some ostracod genera survive during the biotic crisis.Uppermost Pliensbachian-Lowermost Toarcian ostracod assemblages from the Western Tethys: Comparison between Traras Mountains (Algeria), Subbetic (Spain), and Algarve (Portugal) - ScienceDirectUppermost Pliensbachian-Lowermost Toarcian ostracod assemblages from the Western Tethys: Comparison between Traras Mountains (Algeria), Subbetic (Spain), and Algarve (Portugal) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recent morphodynamics of alpine lakes in Southern Carpathian Mountains using high-resolution optical imagery - ScienceDirectThis study reveals for the first time the surface area evolution of glacial lakes in the Romanian Carpathians over 47 years. The research also advances our understanding of the potential of satellite-based remote sensing techniques to monitor the geomorphologic evolution of 27 rock basins into glacial lakes in the Retezat Mountains, Southern Romanian Carpathians. These mountains host most of the glacial lakes in Romania, including both the widest and deepest glacial lakes.Recent morphodynamics of alpine lakes in Southern Carpathian Mountains using high-resolution optical imagery - ScienceDirectRecent morphodynamics of alpine lakes in Southern Carpathian Mountains using high-resolution optical imagery - ScienceDirectAnalysis of the surface area extension and reduction revealed that catchment aspect, catchment size, lake elevation, land cover, topography, and lake depth are the main environmental factors controlling the present state of the glacial lakes in the central part of the Retezat Mountains. The results suggest that the different behavior of glacial lakes within the north-facing valleys compared with the evolution of the lakes settled in southern exposed valleys is mainly due to climatic and geomorphologic particularities of the opposing slopes. On the northern side, the lakes are slowly decreasing due to more intense geomorphologic activity of both the erosivity of precipitations and periglacial processes (e.g., gelifraction, mass wasting, and permafrost degradation). High altitude lakes generally are increasing because of the longer duration of the ice cover and the smaller amounts of sediment yielded by the nature of the soil (or lack thereof) and vegetation cover in the alpine area. Lakes with small catchments show the highest variability, displaying significant changes, whereas shallow lakes are the most prone to horizontal and vertical silting. These controls, which regulate changes in lake basin sizes, provide baseline information on current trends in the evolution of Romanian Carpathian alpine lakes. The methodology applied here could be widely applicable to other similar environments, with widespread implications for understanding the global effects of climate change on alpine lakes.Recent morphodynamics of alpine lakes in Southern Carpathian Mountains using high-resolution optical imagery - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectEffective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectTwo power functions describe flow frequency distributions in snowmelt regimes.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectScaling relations indicate gravel rating curve steepness in headwater streams.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectThe sum of the exponents of flow frequency and bedload rating curves indicate Qeff.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectThe steepness of bedload rating curves and stream type mainly affect Qeff.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectQeff is near Qmax in plane-bed streams and near Qbf in some step-pool streams.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectEffective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 (970) 491 8203.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 (303) 440 8795.Effective discharge in Rocky Mountain headwater streams - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 (970) 295 5984.Soil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoil CO2 emissions in forests were more affected than in meadow, CH4 uptake was slightly perturbed.Soil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectA significant positive correlation was found between cumulative soil CH4 uptake and CO2 emissions.Soil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoil nitrogen leaching was greater in a susceptible mountain pine forest ecosystem.Soil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoil inorganic nitrogen had week stimulatory or suppressive effects on soil CH4 and CO2.Soil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoil CH4 and CO2 dynamics and nitrogen transformations with incubation in mountain forest and meadow ecosystems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectCranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectThe sexes of the Olkhon mountain vole do not differ in cranium size or shape.Cranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectThe island populations differ significantly in skull shape.Cranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectThere is no association between skull shape and geographic distances between islands.Cranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectDrift and selection may be the origin of variation in skull shape of A. olchonensis.Cranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectThe Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis) is an endemic species of the Lake Baikal area with an extremely restricted range. We investigated the pattern of differentiation of cranial shape and size in five isolated insular populations of A. olchonensis from the Baikal islands (Olkhon, Hubyn, Borokchin, Ogoy, and Zamogoy). The ventral aspect of the cranium was analysed using landmark-based geometric morphometric methods While the sexes of A. olchonensis did not differ regarding cranium size and shape, multivariate statistical analyses showed that there were inter-island differences in skull morphology. Voles from the four small islands were similar in cranium size; the large skull size of voles inhabiting the Olkhon Island may be due to the more favourable habitat conditions on Olkhon. Shape differences among island populations were not associated with the geographic distances between islands. The voles from Borokchin Island differ the most in skull shape compared to other island populations. The combination of reduced gene flow among island populations (due to isolation and drift during population fluctuations) may be a suitable explanation for the significant differences in skull shape among island populations of A. olchonensis.Cranial size and shape variation in isolated populations of the Olkhon mountain vole (Alticola olchonensis Litvinov, 1960) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Intra-annual radial growth of Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana Fisch. et Mey) and its response to climate on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains - ScienceDirectIntra-annual radial growth of Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana Fisch. et Mey) and its response to climate on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Contrasting water sources of evergreen and deciduous tree species in rocky mountain area of Beijing, China - ScienceDirectContrasting water sources of evergreen and deciduous tree species in rocky mountain area of Beijing, China - ScienceDirectSelected tree species are important afforestation species in the Beijing area.Contrasting water sources of evergreen and deciduous tree species in rocky mountain area of Beijing, China - ScienceDirectStable isotope analysis can ascertain water sources for the studied tree species.Contrasting water sources of evergreen and deciduous tree species in rocky mountain area of Beijing, China - ScienceDirectComparing tree water sources provides an insight into species' drought adaptability.Contrasting water sources of evergreen and deciduous tree species in rocky mountain area of Beijing, China - ScienceDirectContrasting water sources of evergreen and deciduous tree species in rocky mountain area of Beijing, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Characterizing recent and projecting future potential patterns of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectCharacterizing recent and projecting future potential patterns of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectA GLM was integrated with remote sensing to project annual MPB mortality.Characterizing recent and projecting future potential patterns of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectResidential housing density was positively associated with MPB mortality.Characterizing recent and projecting future potential patterns of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectSummer precipitation had a negative relationship with MPB mortality.Characterizing recent and projecting future potential patterns of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectThe outbreak will continue to expand under future climate projections.Characterizing recent and projecting future potential patterns of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectThe Early Pleistocene Gigantopithecus-Sinomastodon fauna from Juyuan karst cave in Boyue Mountain, Guangxi, South China - ScienceDirectThe Early Pleistocene Gigantopithecus-Sinomastodon fauna from Juyuan karst cave in Boyue Mountain, Guangxi, South China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mountain mutilation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Femoral Traction Splints in Mountain Rescue Prehospital Care: To Use or Not to Use? That Is the Question - ScienceDirectTo determine the incidence of femur fractures in mountain rescue in England and Wales. To investigate the attitudes of rescuers toward the use of femoral traction splints. To review the literature for evidence on the use of traction splints in prehospital medicine and test the hypothesis that femoral traction splints reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with a fractured femur.Femoral Traction Splints in Mountain Rescue Prehospital Care: To Use or Not to Use? That Is the Question - ScienceDirectThe Mountain Rescue England and Wales database was searched for cases of suspected fractured femur occurring between 2002 and 2012, a questionnaire was sent to all mountain rescue teams in England and Wales, and a literature review was performed. Relevant articles were critically reviewed to identify the evidence base for the use of femoral traction splints.Femoral Traction Splints in Mountain Rescue Prehospital Care: To Use or Not to Use? That Is the Question - ScienceDirectFemur fractures are uncommon in mountain rescue, with an incidence of suspected femur fractures on scene at 9.3 a year. Traction splints are used infrequently; 13% of the suspected femur fractures were treated with traction. However, rescuers have a positive attitude toward traction splints and perceive few disadvantages to their use. No trials demonstrate that traction splints reduce morbidity or mortality, but a number describe complications resulting from their use.Femoral Traction Splints in Mountain Rescue Prehospital Care: To Use or Not to Use? That Is the Question - ScienceDirectFemur fractures are rare within mountain rescue. Traction splints may be no more effective than other methods of splinting in prehospital care. We failed to identify evidence that supports the hypothesis that traction splints reduce morbidity or mortality. We advocate the use of a femoral traction splints but recognize that other splints may also be appropriate in this environment.Femoral Traction Splints in Mountain Rescue Prehospital Care: To Use or Not to Use?

Field and satellite data (WorldView-2 and SENTINEL-1) were used to obtain a geomorphological description of the landslide and a 3D geometric reconstruction of the rock avalanche. With deposits exceeding 14 million cubic meters in volume, the rock avalanche is one of the largest catastrophic landslides in the world. The rock avalanche was controlled by tectonic setting. The slope instability was favored by the presence of NW-SE and NE-SW trending fault systems, steep foliation and morphology. The rock avalanche was likely triggered by an earthquake related to the activity of the Tolbonuur and Hovd faults. Although the area is sparsely populated, the settlement of Munhkhairkhan Soum is threatened by rockfalls or even by rock avalanches that could be triggered by future earthquakes along these faults.Assessment of a catastrophic rock avalanche in the West Mongolian Altai Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectEnvironmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectDivision of labour can be beneficial for the environmental performance.Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectLess favoured production regions have comparative environmental advantages.Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectEconomic principles to optimise production are applicable in environmental context.Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectDivision of labour decreased workload and farm income on mountain farms.Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectIncome per hour can be increased on both, lowland and mountain farms.Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems - ScienceDirectSwiss mountains and lowlands feature different climatic and topographic conditions for agricultural production. Thus, farmers developed a collaborative dairy production scheme, where they take advantage of the specific environment of the two regions. In this contract rearing system, the young stock is reared on a mountain farm and the more intensive milk production is performed in the lowlands. This system is an example for the principle of comparative advantage, where each region focuses on the activity where it has the lowest opportunity costs. We hypothesised that the same principle can also be applied in an environmental context, to reduce the environmental impacts of agricultural production. Based on the life cycle assessments of average dairy farms, we could show that the absolute environmental impact was higher on mountain farms for both, the production of one heifer for restocking and the production of one kg milk. However, they had a comparative environmental advantage for rearing, as the young stock was better suitable for their local conditions than the dairy cows. Therefore, milk produced in collaboration between lowland and mountain farms had an up to 4.5% lower non-renewable energy demand and used up to 30.9% less potassium and up to 5.2% less phosphorus resources compared to non-collaborative production. Further consequences of collaboration were a reduced workload and income on mountain farms, and a potentially increased income on lowland farms. We conclude that the principle of comparative environmental advantage is appropriate as a screening method to identify suitable production systems for less favoured regions. However, the total effects of a possible division of labour among regions need to be assessed in a more holistic way where possible side-effects on other aspects are considered as well.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectInfluence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectLidar measurements of above-canopy mountain-valley flows are presented in high detail.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectAlternative turbulence parameters are evaluated for estimating canopy coupling.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectFriction velocity fails to accurately estimate canopy mixing during downslope flow.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectRelationship between turbulence and stability is not straightforward.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectInfluence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectCurrent affiliation: National Wind Technology Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado, USA.Influence of regional nighttime atmospheric regimes on canopy turbulence and gradients at a closed and open forest in mountain-valley terrain - ScienceDirectCurrent affiliation: Pacific Northwest Research Station, U.S. Forest Service, Washington, USA.Factors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectFactors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectNumerical modeling and direct field observations are used to understand controls on wood transport in mountain riversFactors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectPatterns of wood transport differ between single- and multi-thread river reachesFactors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectLog diameter controls wood transport in multithread channel, whereas log length is key in single-thread channelsFactors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectWe also document a nonlinear relationship between wood transport and flood magnitudeFactors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectOur observations are likely to be applicable to a much larger suite of mountain riversFactors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectAs with bedload transport, wood transport in rivers is governed by several factors such as flow regime, geomorphic configuration of the channel and floodplain, or wood size and shape. Because large-wood tends to be transported during floods, safety and logistical constraints make field measurements difficult. As a result, direct observation and measurements of the conditions of wood transport are scarce. This lack of direct observations and the complexity of the processes involved in wood transport may result in an incomplete understanding of wood transport processes. Numerical modelling provides an alternative approach to addressing some of the unknowns in the dynamics of large-wood in rivers. The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of controls governing wood transport in mountain rivers, combining numerical modelling and direct field observations. By defining different scenarios, we illustrate relationships between the rate of wood transport and discharge, wood size, and river morphology. We test these relationships for a wide, multithread reach and a narrower, partially channelized single-thread reach of the Czarny Dunajec River in the Polish Carpathians. Results indicate that a wide range of quantitative information about wood transport can be obtained from a combination of numerical modelling and field observations and from document contrasting patterns of wood transport in single- and multithread river reaches. On the one hand, log diameter seems to have a greater importance for wood transport in the multithread channel because of shallower flow, lower flow velocity, and lower stream power. Hydrodynamic conditions in the single-thread channel allow transport of large-wood pieces, whereas in the multithread reach, logs with diameters similar to water depth are not being moved. On the other hand, log length also exerts strong control on wood transport, more so in the single-thread than in the multithread reach. In any case, wood transport strongly decreases with increasing piece volume, although this relation is not linear. We also document a nonlinear relationship between wood transport and flood magnitude. A threshold discharge was identified below which wood transport is negligible. This threshold is higher in the multithread reach, while in the single-thread reach floods of lower magnitude are able to transport wood downstream. Wood transport ratio increases with discharge until it reaches an upper threshold or tipping point, and then decreases or increases much more slowly. This threshold is clearly related to bankfull discharge, but it is much higher for the multithread reach than for the single-thread one. Although modelling input and field observations were taken from a specific river, our findings and conclusions are likely to be applicable to a much larger suite of (mountain) rivers.Factors controlling large-wood transport in a mountain river - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Monitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectMonitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectThirteen medium and large-sized wildlife species through tunnels, bridges and culverts.Monitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectMonitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectThe tunnel and the bridges have been important passages for some species.Monitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectMost species preferred to bridges and tunnels.Monitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectMonitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectMonitoring wildlife crossing structures along highways in Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Lithic resource management in mountain environments: The Andean sector of Tierra Del Fuego - ScienceDirectLithic resource management is one of the most important variables for the analysis of technological organization in hunter-gatherer societies. As essential resources for the manufacturing of tools that are themselves involved in processing and consumption of other types of resources, lithic raw materials constitute the starting point of all production processes. Although well studied in different environments, lithic resource management is difficult to analyze in mountain contexts, especially due to problems of site formation and archaeological visibility. In this paper, we present the research strategies adopted in order to study lithic resource management in mountains and piedmont areas in the Andean sector of Tierra del Fuego.Lithic resource management in mountain environments: The Andean sector of Tierra Del Fuego - ScienceDirectWe carried out a program of systematic surveys in different landscapes according to the methodology of distributional analysis and considering two different perspectives: location and characterization of raw material sources, and evaluation of land occupation by hunter-gatherer societies. Lithic materials were studied following a techno-functional perspective that includes the interrelated study of technology (raw materials and manufacturing techniques) and use wear (microscopic analysis). Then, results were confronted with those of excavated sites, which are located in different landscapes and landscape units and have different functionalities, such as campsites, ceremonial sites, etc. The results obtained confirm that local materials from secondary sources were the most used, although there are also some allochtonous good quality rocks, coming from sources located at different distances.Lithic resource management in mountain environments: The Andean sector of Tierra Del Fuego - ScienceDirectThis research let us adjust field methods for surveys in wooded mountain environments, as well as discuss some more general aspects regarding the exploitation of lithic resources in mountain regions. These landscapes may seem, at a first glance, as ideal provision places for hunter-gatherers because of abundance of lithic materials. However, these are not always available in terms of visibility and accessibility; on the other hand, not all rocks can be used for the manufacture of all types of tools. We can then propose that hunter-gatherer societies that highly depend on lithic resources seek to exploit outcrops where visibility and accessibility are high, but that also search for a variety of raw materials with different characteristics that allow manufacturing of different artifacts. From these data, it is possible to discuss mobility, seasonality and interaction of hunter-gatherer groups.Lithic resource management in mountain environments: The Andean sector of Tierra Del Fuego -

ScienceDirectSympatric mountain chickadee songs were less similar to black-capped chickadee songs than were those of allopatric males.Character displacement in dawn chorusing behaviour of sympatric mountain and black-capped chickadees - ScienceDirectSignals of closely related species tend to be more distinct when occurring in sympatry than in allopatry. Such differences allow species-specific identification and presumably reduce interspecific mating. Among chickadees, dawn chorus behaviour affects female mate choice. Within our sympatric study population of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, and mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, directional hybridization occurs via extrapair matings between female mountain chickadees (the subordinate species) and male black-capped chickadees (the dominant species). In this study, we compared dawn singing from this sympatric population with dawn recordings from allopatric populations of each species. Mountain chickadees used more chick-a-dee calls than songs during the dawn chorus when they co-occurred with black-capped chickadees in the sympatric population, but used similar proportions of calls and songs in the allopatric populations. We also found differences in the fine structure of the song; both species typically had a descending first note in their song (glissando), but mountain chickadees in the sympatric population used an ascending first note. The internote ratio between the first two notes of the song of the sympatric mountain chickadees lacked a characteristic frequency drop found in the allopatric mountain chickadee population and in the allopatric and sympatric populations of black-capped chickadees. Geographical analysis of songs of mountain chickadees across western North America revealed consistent differences in song features among sympatric/allopatric populations in different regions, but the nature of character shifts were not always parallel among populations. These findings illustrate possible character displacement in a subordinate species (mountain chickadee) to reduce acoustic overlap with a dominant heterospecific (black-capped chickadee).Character displacement in dawn chorusing behaviour of sympatric mountain and black-capped chickadees - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectPrediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectWe calculate amplification factors and seismic displacements of dry mountain slopes.Prediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectWe perform 2D nonlinear analyses to obtain equivalent acceleration time histories.Prediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectWe show that shallow mountain slopes should not be modeled as a rigid block.Prediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectA new flexible sliding block model provide reliable estimate of displacement.Prediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectSuccess rates of the model to predict the landslide hazard categories are evaluated.Prediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectPrediction of seismic displacement of dry mountain slopes composed of a soft thin uniform layer - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectMulti-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe landslide susceptibility was analyzed in catchment scale and local scale.Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectRainfall in the future was predicted by the atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM).Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectThis study aims to study the landslides along the mountain highway Nantou County Road #89 of Taiwan.Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe pros and cons of the analysis in catchment scale and local scale were discussed.Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe results of this study could be applied for the risk assessment and management.Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectFor the past decade, climate change has caused increasingly more frequent extreme rainfall events in Taiwan, during which concentrated and intense rainfall has induced large-scale flooding and landslides. Considering the urgency of protecting isolated villages and residential areas near highways from large-scale landslides, this study analyzed landslide susceptibility along Nantou County Road #89, in the upstream region of the Wu River in Taiwan. To assess landslide hazards spatially, landslide susceptibility analysis was implemented at the catchment scale. To predict landslide susceptibility, this study employed an atmospheric general circulation model with downscaling estimation. Information from boreholes was used to analyze the temporal behavior and complex mechanisms of large-scale landslides at the local scale. On the basis of the results, this paper discusses the different findings from the catchment- and local-scale analyses. For the major large-scale landslides, the rankings of landslide susceptibility values can be obtained to prioritize the remediation of the landslides. And the multiscale landslide susceptibility analysis could be applied to mountain highways with complex landslide hazard.Multi-scale landslide susceptibility analysis along a mountain highway in Central Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ultra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectUltra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectPeridotite xenoliths trace ultra-depleted ancient cratonic mantle.Ultra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectUltra-depleted mantle infiltrated by complex melts/magmaUltra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectMesozoic lithospheric mantle in central NCC incorporates Archean and Paleoproterozoic components.Ultra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectBoundary of cratonic destruction in NCC coincides with the Taihang Mountains.Ultra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectUltra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (761KB)Download full-size imageUltra-depleted peridotite xenoliths in the Northern Taihang Mountains: Implications for the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Changes in classified precipitation in the urban, suburban, and mountain areas of Beijing - ScienceDirectChanges in classified precipitation in the urban, suburban, and mountain areas of Beijing - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration).Ecosophy and tourism: Rethinking a mountain resort - ScienceDirectEcosophy and tourism: Rethinking a mountain resort - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Species diversity of butterflies in Changbai Mountain in China - ScienceDirectSpecies diversity of butterflies in Changbai Mountain in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Phylogenetic relationships and evolution of high mountain buttercups (Ranunculus) in North America and Central Asia - ScienceDirectThe evolutionary history of high mountain plants in the Northern hemisphere has frequently been shaped by geographical isolation and allopatric speciation. In sympatry, high mountain systems potentially provide opportunities for ecological speciation along altitudinal belts and via polyploidy. However, the role of habitat and cytotype differentiation as isolation mechanisms is poorly understood. We developed a well-resolved phylogenetic framework for a clade of 34 North American and Central Asian mountain Ranunculi to reconstruct sister relationships and ecogeographical patterns. Based on seven DNA sequence markers (ITS of nrDNA, rpl32-trnL, trnT-trnL, ndhA intron, petL-psbE, trnV-ndhC, matK/trnK, and the psbJ-petA intergenic spacer) we utilized Maximum Likelihood and NeighborNet analyses. Data on habitat, altitude and ploidy levels were mapped onto the phylogenetic tree by using Mesquite analysis, and ecological differentiation was tested by habitat contrasts of sister species and by pairwise matching analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five well supported geographical subclades (two in North America, each one in Southern Central Asia, northern Central Asia/Arctic and in European/Asian lowland). The North American sister species exhibit allopatric, parapatric and sympatric distributions and represent even in sympatry distinct genetic clusters with some degree of habitat and/or cytotype differentiation. In the Himalayas and in the mountains of Taiwan all sister taxa occur in sympatry and form multiple genetic clusters; habitat differentiation is significantly lower than in North America, while cytotype diversity is poorly documented. In the temperate to arctic mountains of North America, ecological differentiation along altitudinal belts and/or cytotype differentiation may contribute to maintenance of species boundaries in sympatry. In the Himalayas, the restriction of buttercups to higher altitudes probably hampers ecological differentiation; hence, ongoing hybridization blurs species boundaries in sympatry. Isolation mechanisms in high mountain systems cannot be generalized but depend on the peculiar geomorphological and climatic conditions.Phylogenetic relationships and evolution of high mountain buttercups (Ranunculus) in North America and Central Asia -

ScienceDirectA prevailing classical narrative avers that mountain landscapes in Sub-Saharan Africa are highly degraded and are natural hazard hotspots. Soil erosion processes and a range of natural hazards particularly landslides that transpire in mountain landscapes have been invoked in support of the unsustainable and non-resilient paradigm. This narrative currently constitutes the major knowledge base informing the scientific discourse, policy options and landscape interventions. Implicating population as the major underpinning for land degradation and natural hazards, this narrative linearly conceives human environmental interactions as retrogressively tilted. This paper based on case studies and literature synthesis contends that, whilst soil erosion and natural hazard processes are more prominent in mountain landscapes, the conceptualized high level land degradation might be more spatially random than systematic while the propounded ecological impact and productivity impact may be suboptimal. Similarly it proffers that high population density in mountain landscape un-linearly contributes as much to land degradation processes as it does also to sustainable landscape management.Revisiting socio-ecological resilience and sustainability in the coupled mountain landscapes in Eastern Africa - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gendered decision-making practices in Alaska's dynamic mountain environments?

A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectUnderstanding the factors responsible for species rarity is key for designing effective management strategies aimed at long-term conservation of species. Most such studies investigate plant size, competitive vigour or habitat requirements, but studies that explore more complex characteristics of species directly related to different stages of the plant life cycle are much less common. Germination is the most critical stage in the life cycle of many plants and is the primary source of variation in the regeneration niche. However, only a few authors have studied differences in germination requirements between common and rare congeners, and none have studied these requirements for large sets of species.Are there systematic differences in germination between rare and common species? A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study was to compare seed mass, germination requirements and proportions of germinated seeds of rare and common congeners across a large set of species. We analysed seed mass, proportions of germinated seeds in specific conditions and total proportions of germinated seeds of 18 congeneric pairs of rare and common plant species. We tested different lengths of cold stratification, constant or alternating temperatures, and different light conditions.Are there systematic differences in germination between rare and common species? A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectSeed mass of rare and common congeners was not significantly different. The results indicated that after cold stratification, the proportions of germinated seeds were higher in rare than in common species. In common species, the proportions of germinated seeds were significantly higher during cold stratification than those of rare species. Rare species had higher proportions of germinated seeds than those of their common congeners, and total proportions of germinated seeds were influenced by seed mass and species rarity.

The laterites formed as a result of prolonged weathering of the ophiolite assemblage under tropical to subtropical conditions.Geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of low grade Ni-lateritic soil (Oman Mountains, Oman) - ScienceDirectNine laterite profiles have been examined for their Ni potential along a NW-SE segment of the Oman Mountains. The preserved laterite profile shows variations in thickness, mineralogy, and chemical composition. The profiles show a vertical succession from bedrock protolith through saprolite, oxide laterite, to clay laterite. The laterite profiles are unconformably capped either by clastics rocks of the Late Cretaceous Qahlah Formation or by Palaeogene carbonates of the Jafnayn or Abat Formations.Geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of low grade Ni-lateritic soil (Oman Mountains, Oman) - ScienceDirectThe protolith corresponds either to a fine-grained, blackish to greenish serpentinized peridotite or to a coarse-grained dark green altered layered gabbro.Geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of low grade Ni-lateritic soil (Oman Mountains, Oman) - ScienceDirectThe bulk geochemistry of the studied profiles indicates a typical low Ni-laterite pattern in which magnesium (Mg) and silica (Si) become depleted towards the top of the profile, whereas iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) increase. A significant enrichment in Ni and Co occurred as a result of the laterization process. Ni concentrations average 0.63% (Ibra), 0.72% (East Ibra), 0.67% (Al-Russayl), and 0.33% (Tiwi). Other elements such as Cr, V, Pb, TiO2, Zr, Ba, and Zn were also remobilized across the profiles during the laterization processes.Geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of low grade Ni-lateritic soil (Oman Mountains, Oman) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Genetic diversity of golden takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi) population from Qinling Mountains in China revealed by sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region - ScienceDirectThe golden takin is an endangered species, listed as a First Grade Protected animal and found only in the Qinling Mountains in China. A great deal of research on the golden takin's living habitat, population size, and home range has been conducted. Here, we employed sequence analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region to study the genetic diversity of the golden takin from three separate nature reserve parks in the Qinling Mountains. We also compared the results of our study with previously published data on the genetic diversity of mixed takin species located in the Qinling Mountains and the Minshan area. Based on 62 sampled golden takin individuals, we found an overall mean genetic haplotype diversity of 0.687. There is no significant geographic genetic diversity across different golden takin populations within the Qinling Mountains. However, we did show significant diversity between golden takin from the Qinling Mountains and from Minshan. These original data provide a foundation for the genetic diversity of golden takin, and will yield comprehensive information for better supporting the management in the national reserve parks.Genetic diversity of golden takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi) population from Qinling Mountains in China revealed by sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Devonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectDevonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectDevonian sediments in the Xiqingshan Mountains were deposited in a foreland basin.Devonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectSedimentation occurred in non-marine to shallow-marine environments.Devonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectLower Devonian sandstones are dominated by feldspathic litharenite.Devonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectDevonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectSediments were eroded from an uplifted Neoproterozoic arc fragment.Devonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectDevonian sedimentation in the Xiqingshan Mountains: Implications for paleogeographic reconstructions of the SW Qinling Orogen - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Diversity and Distribution of Host Animal Species of Hantavirus and Risk to Human Health in Jiuhua Mountain Area, China - ScienceDirectTo investigate the diversity and the distribution of host animal species of hantavirus and the effect on human health in Jiuhua Mountain area, China.Diversity and Distribution of Host Animal Species of Hantavirus and Risk to Human Health in Jiuhua Mountain Area, China - ScienceDirectThe host animal species of hantavirus was surveyed by using the trap method and the species diversity was evaluated by using the Simpson, Shannon-Weaner, and Pielou indices.

A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectGermination characteristics did not explain species rarity.Are there systematic differences in germination between rare and common species? A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectUnderstanding the factors responsible for species rarity is key for designing effective management strategies aimed at long-term conservation of species. Most such studies investigate plant size, competitive vigour or habitat requirements, but studies that explore more complex characteristics of species directly related to different stages of the plant life cycle are much less common. Germination is the most critical stage in the life cycle of many plants and is the primary source of variation in the regeneration niche. However, only a few authors have studied differences in germination requirements between common and rare congeners, and none have studied these requirements for large sets of species.Are there systematic differences in germination between rare and common species? A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study was to compare seed mass, germination requirements and proportions of germinated seeds of rare and common congeners across a large set of species. We analysed seed mass, proportions of germinated seeds in specific conditions and total proportions of germinated seeds of 18 congeneric pairs of rare and common plant species. We tested different lengths of cold stratification, constant or alternating temperatures, and different light conditions.Are there systematic differences in germination between rare and common species? A case study from central European mountains - ScienceDirectSeed mass of rare and common congeners was not significantly different. The results indicated that after cold stratification, the proportions of germinated seeds were higher in rare than in common species. In common species, the proportions of germinated seeds were significantly higher during cold stratification than those of rare species. Rare species had higher proportions of germinated seeds than those of their common congeners, and total proportions of germinated seeds were influenced by seed mass and species rarity. Rare species were apparently well adapted to local conditions in the mountains and the inability to germinate was clearly not a cause for their rarity. The study provides unique data on proportions of germinated seeds over a wide spectrum of species and conditions.Late-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectLate-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectClimate, vegetation, and human activity influenced watershed-scale fire activity.Late-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectFire activity was highest in the early Holocene when climate was warmest.Late-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectRainforest tree taxa were most abundant in the mid-Holocene when climate was wet.Late-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectSclerophyll woodlands increased in the Late Holocene following a major fire event.Late-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectVegetation arrangement may have influenced the local Aboriginal land use history.Late-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectLate-glacial and Holocene records of fire and vegetation from Cradle Mountain National Park, Tasmania, Australia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The vegetation history of Qinling Mountains, China - ScienceDirectThe vegetation history of Qinling Mountains, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe Lausche Hill is a polycyclic volcano of Lower Oligocene age.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe Lausche Volcano covers a pre-volcanic surface.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectSix Oligocene volcanoes of the Lausitz Mts. are preserved in their subaerial level.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ion deficit restricts the distribution of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in very dilute mountain lakes - ScienceDirectThe current study is, according to our knowledge, the first study indicating that ion deficit is an important restrictor to the distribution of brown trout populations in very dilute mountain lakes.

Organic and inorganic forms of carbon and nitrogen were measured in five soil chronosequences in the Transantarctic Mountains using flash combustion and spectrometry. Accumulation of coal carbon was significant in the Beardmore Glacier area and was quantified using chemi-thermal oxidation followed by flash combustion. Carbon levels decreased with drift age for two of the sequences. Decreases in carbon in the Hatherton Glacier sequence were due primarily to high levels of carbon in young ice-cored drifts. Carbon content increased with drift age for the Beardmore Glacier sequence due to the presence of coal in older drifts. Nitrogen content increased with age for a majority of the soil chronosequences. Inorganic carbon and all forms of nitrogen were significantly and positively correlated with mean annual precipitation. Our results suggest that carbon levels in similar settings do not significantly change over time; changes in temperature or moisture associated with microclimate likely play a much larger role in carbon and nitrogen levels.Carbon and nitrogen trends in soil chronosequences of the Transantarctic Mountains -

Farm diversification in the Pyrenees - ScienceDirectThe continuity of farming in mountain areas in Europe is at severe risk and its future faces manifold uncertainties. Mountain farms are immersed in a long-term process of reorganization. Farm diversification plays a prominent role in this process of adjustment and reallocation. However, little work has been done explicitly on the role farm diversification plays in the current structural changes occurring. In order to fill this void, the nature of farm diversification has been examined in the Pyrenees, where four different typologies of farms have been identified: absence of diversification, agricultural diversification, farmland diversification and finally farm labour diversification. These typologies reflect a gradation along which the farm diversification practices are applied to more aspects of the farm household. Throughout this gradation farming is increasingly marginalised. Finally, it is argued that the endorsement of policy measures stimulating farm diversification in mountain regions should be cautiously considered, since there is high risk of encouraging further agricultural abandonment.Is farming enough in mountain areas?

In this study, 23 rainstorm events, surficial sediments, and debris flow deposits were analyzed to quantify the area's rainfall threshold and to investigate how such conditions may be used to predict debris flow in this region. Rainfall threshold of intensity-duration (I-D) functions after vegetation recovery was higher than before recovery and also higher than I-D levels in other regions where debris flows are closely associated with runoff. Field investigations revealed that surficial sediments were characterized by coarse-grained sediments and that debris flow deposits lacked fine particles. Local debris flows can be triggered by runoff; however, no single standard equation is used to predict the conditions that lead to runoff-triggered debris flow; and commonly used equations give different values. Here, we propose an empirical function that takes into account peak discharge per width and particle diameter. This model should be verified with further investigations so that it can be used as a reference to analyze the conditions that lead to debris flow in the study area. Finally, debris flows may have been related to occasional storms in the study area, which has been experiencing substantially increased temperatures and decreased annual precipitation. This work provides important information about the conditions that initiated debris flow in the Beijing mountain regions in the last few decades.Variation in initiation condition of debris flows in the mountain regions surrounding Beijing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectAssessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectMountain soil organic carbon stocks characterized by large spatial variabilityAssessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectSpatial variability causes large uncertainty of mountain SOC stocks.Assessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectThe coarse fraction introduces the largest uncertainty in mountain SOC stocks.Assessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectKnowledge on spatial distribution of geomorphic processes improves SOC stocks.Assessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectAssessment of variability and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in a mountainous boreal forest (Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reinventing mountain settlements: A GIS model for identifying possible ski towns in the U.S. Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectFormer mining and ranching settlements in the U.S. Rocky Mountains frequently seek to reinvent themselves as the industries that created them have declined. Redevelopment as ski resorts is a common strategy that can successfully revive the economies of mountain settlements but this approach, if undertaken without careful advanced planning, can also have negative consequences, damaging fragile alpine environments, overwhelming social and housing services and distorting local economies. This study develops a GIS-based model that follows a systematic sequential elimination procedure to identify those Rocky Mountain settlements most likely to be attractive to ski resort development, based on the location criteria of existing ski areas. Results show that while no single settlement is an obvious candidate for development by the ski industry, a number of places are contenders in a way that can be systematically measured and evaluated. Moreover, the methodology used can be applied to additional areas subject to winter sports growth worldwide.Reinventing mountain settlements: A GIS model for identifying possible ski towns in the U.S. Rocky Mountains -

To unravel this process 21 number of MF samples and 32 number of RZ samples were collected and analyzed for major ions using standard procedures. The bivariate plot of selected parameters indicate most of the MF samples have lesser ionic strength, higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (log pCO2) value, less pH and release more silica during weathering than that of the RZ samples. Furthermore impact of agriculture and feldspar weathering is also noted in the MF regions and the urban sewage signatures are found in few samples of MF and RZ region. Most of the RZ samples are represented by state of saturation to super saturation with respect to carbonate minerals. Thermodynamically the MF samples are more stable near the kaolinite boundaries in the silicate stabilities fields. The main factors governing the geochemistry of both the regions are interplay of leaching and dissolution, weathering and agriculture. It was also inferred that land-use and lithology play a significant role in groundwater composition of the region.Geochemical signatures of groundwater along mountain front and riparian zone of Courtallam, Tamil Nadu - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (546KB)Download full-size imageGeochemical signatures of groundwater along mountain front and riparian zone of Courtallam, Tamil Nadu - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectThe influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectWater cycle has accelerated.The influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectMeltwater contributed by 35% to runoff.The influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectEvaporation accounts for 10% to precipitation.The influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectTranspiration accounts for 17% to precipitation.The influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectThe influence from the shrinking cryosphere and strengthening evopotranspiration on hydrologic process in a cold basin, Qilian Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Linking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectLinking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectWe created a statewide metapopulation model for mountain lions in Montana.Linking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectWe used our model to predict change in population growth given proposed harvest rates.Linking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectThe effect of uncertainty in initial parameter estimations and dispersal rate lessen with scale.Linking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectTools such as this are useful in harvest planning at regional and statewide levels.Linking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectLinking resource selection and mortality modeling for population estimation of mountain lions in Montana - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Expression of the Younger Dryas cold event in the Carpathian Mountains, Ukraine?

Knowledge about methanotrophs and their diversity is important to understand the microbial mediation of the greenhouse gas CH4 under climate change. The methanotrophs is one of main functional microbial groups in soil mediating methane cycles of terrestrial ecosystem. The purpose of this study was to explore spatial distribution pattern of methanotrophs diversity and the major factors affecting soil methanotrophs diversity along an elevation gradient on vertical natural belt of the North Tianshan Mountains, soil samples were collected at six sites in 2010, which were desert grassland belt (H1), Mountain grassland belt (H2), Mountain forest belt (H3), sub-alpine cushion belt (H4), alpine cushion belt (H5), alpine tundra vegetation (H6).

At the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center in Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda), an adult female was observed using a bamboo culm as a ladder for her offspring. This is one of only a few documented cases of possible tool use in wild gorillas, although tool use behavior is commonly observed in captive gorillas. Although the behavior observed may have been incidental, the present report in combination with previous evidence (Breuer et al., 2005) suggests that tool use in gorillas occurs outside the context of food acquisition and may be directed at overcoming physical obstacles in complex rugged microhabitats such as bamboo forest and swamps.Possible tool use in a mountain gorilla -

ScienceDirectRiver basins and valleys surrounded by dividing mountainous ranges are considered to be the basis for distribution of population and settlements in mountainous countries. In these areas physical-geographical factors are interrelated and interconnected, having a direct influence on distribution of population and settlements. Mountainous relief is preventing the consolidation of territory and development of fundamental processes of resettlement. For these areas basins and river valley-types of settlement systems are the most typical. As the economic activities of settlements are closely related to natural environment, the influence of natural environment on rural areas and settlements is bigger than on urban settlements: particularly, in mountainous areas with a great diversity of natural conditions. On the basis of analysis and generalization of the research outcomes of the author and different other researchers, some geographical features and development regularities of rural areas and settlements distribution in mountainous countries are worked out.Geographical features and development regularities of rural areas and settlements distribution in mountain countries - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Journal Annals of Agrarian Science.Sex that moves mountains: The influence of spawning fish on river profiles over geologic timescales - ScienceDirectSex that moves mountains: The influence of spawning fish on river profiles over geologic timescales - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation in soil organic carbon by slope aspect in the middle of the Qilian Mountains in the upper Heihe River Basin, China - ScienceDirectVariation in soil organic carbon by slope aspect in the middle of the Qilian Mountains in the upper Heihe River Basin, China - ScienceDirectHigh variation in abiotic and biotic factors by slope aspectVariation in soil organic carbon by slope aspect in the middle of the Qilian Mountains in the upper Heihe River Basin, China - ScienceDirectThe distribution of SOC regulated by both biotic and abiotic factorsVariation in soil organic carbon by slope aspect in the middle of the Qilian Mountains in the upper Heihe River Basin, China - ScienceDirectThe SOC protection measures must be based on aspect specific.Variation in soil organic carbon by slope aspect in the middle of the Qilian Mountains in the upper Heihe River Basin, China - ScienceDirectVariation in soil organic carbon by slope aspect in the middle of the Qilian Mountains in the upper Heihe River Basin, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The dynamics of mountain geosystems in southern Siberia - ScienceDirectUsing three key areas as an example we examine the tendencies toward changes of the mountain geosystems in southern Siberia caused by fluctuations of climate.

These machines may operate at high speeds in order to accelerate failures, particularly during the design and prototype phase of wheel development. This paper describes a mathematical model of the dynamics of a wheel test drum assembly, and the validation of the model using data recorded during a wheel test. This model will subsequently be applied to better understand the key test operating parameters that must be controlled in order to produce repeatable durability data during accelerated testing.A mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectA mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectMass wasting generated numerous alluvial fans/fan deltas around the range.A mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectFluvial/alluvial terraces are omnipresent in the range.A mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectFluvial/mass-wasting histories are reconstructed based on >90 radiocarbon dates.A mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectMass wasting exerts strong controls on river behavior.A mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe Holocene bedrock incision has not kept pace with tectonic uplift.A mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectA mass-wasting dominated Quaternary mountain range, the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value - ScienceDirectCultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value - ScienceDirectModel allows the estimation of aesthetic values for most viewpoints in the Alps.Cultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value - ScienceDirectAlpine landscapes with long vistas have the highest aesthetic values.Cultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value - ScienceDirectCultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value - ScienceDirectThe modelling approach can support decision-making and landscape management.Cultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value - ScienceDirectMountain regions meet an increasing demand for pleasant landscapes, offering many cultural ecosystem services to both their residents and tourists. As a result of global change, land managers and policy makers are faced with changes to this landscape and need efficient evaluation techniques to assess cultural ecosystem services. This study provides a spatially explicit modelling approach to estimating aesthetic landscape values by relating spatial landscape patterns to human perceptions via a photo-based survey. The respondents attributed higher aesthetic values to the Alpine landscape in respect to areas with settlements, infrastructure or intensive agricultural use. The aesthetic value of two study areas in the Central Alps (Stubai Valley, Austria and Vinschgau, Italy) was modelled for 10,215 viewpoints along hiking trails according to current land cover and a scenario considering the spontaneous reforestation of abandoned land. Viewpoints with high aesthetic values were mainly located at high altitude, allowing long vistas, and included views of lakes or glaciers, and the lowest values were for viewpoints close to streets and in narrow valleys with little view. The aesthetic values of the reforestation scenario decreased mainly at higher altitudes, but the whole area was affected, reducing aesthetic value by almost 10% in Stubai Valley and 15% in Vinschgau. Our proposed modelling approach allows the estimation of aesthetic values in spatial and qualitative terms for most viewpoints in the European Alps. The resulting maps can be used as information and the basis for discussion by stakeholders, to support the decision-making process and landscape planning. This paper also discusses the role of mountain farming in preserving an attractive landscape and related cultural values.Streamflow timing of mountain rivers in Spain: Recent changes and future projections -

ScienceDirectHigher pectin content in cell wall promote faster leaf water uptake.Pectin and cellulose cell wall composition enables different strategies to leaf water uptake in plants from tropical fog mountain - ScienceDirectLeaf water uptake (LWU) has been observed in plants of different ecosystems and this process is distinct among different species. Four plant species from the Brazilian fog mountain fields were evaluated in order to detect if leaf water uptake capacity is related to the cell wall composition of leaf epidermis. LWU measurements and their relation to anatomical and biochemical traits were analyzed. Cell wall composition was verified through immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies recognizing pectin compounds, and histochemistry with calcofluor white to track cellulose. Differences in LWU among the four species were clearly revealed. Two species presented higher maximum leaf water content and the lowest values of water absorption speed. The other two species presented opposite behavior, namely, low leaf water uptake and the highest values of water absorption speed. The anatomical traits associated with the cell wall composition corroborated the data on the different LWU strategies. The species with abundant detection of cellulose in their epidermal cell walls absorbed more water, but more slowly, while those with abundant detection of pectins absorbed water at a higher speed. These results indicate that cell wall composition regarding pectin and cellulose are significant for water uptake by the leaf epidermis. Pectin provides greater porosity and absorption speed, while cellulose provides greater hydrophilicity and greater water uptake capacity. Current data indicate that the composition of epidermal cell walls is a relevant trait for leaf water uptake.Analysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectAnalysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectAnalysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectThe thickness change of the debris-covered glacier is determined by many factors.Analysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectThe heavy melting region is not necessary equals the heavy thinning region.Analysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectIt is validated that glacier thinning rate is highly correlated with ice cliffs areas.Analysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectAnalysis of thickness changes and the associated driving factors on a debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectInvestigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectPiping is responsible for periodic water level fluctuations at Mountain Lake.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectPiping occurs through four sinkhole-like depressions at lake-bottom.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectThe piped sediment consists of fine sand and silt at varying densities.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectLab studies indicate that piping occurs under hydraulic gradients of 1 to 10.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectMountain Lake, located in Giles County, southwestern Virginia, is one of only two natural lakes in the state of Virginia. The lake exhibits rare self-draining behavior, with recent episodes in 2008, 2011, and 2012 that drained the lake almost completely and revealed the presence of four sinkhole-like depressions, with piping holes at their bottoms and sides, near the northeastern and northwestern margins of the lake. This phenomenon has raised concern over declining tourism to the Mountain Lake Lodge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the piping potential of lake-bottom sediment and its role in seepage and lake-level fluctuations.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectSixteen grab samples of lake-bottom sediment were collected from the vicinity of the depressions. Additionally, five Shelby tube samples were obtained to determine the in-situ density of the sediment. Grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, and compaction-mold permeameter tests were used to evaluate lake sediment's susceptibility to piping. Grain size distribution and Atterberg limits test results reveal that the lake-bottom sediment consists predominantly of fine sand and silt, which are well known for their susceptibility to piping. Results of the compaction-mold permeameter test show that the critical hydraulic gradient (ic), the hydraulic gradient at which the sediment starts to pipe, ranges between 1 and 10, depending on the density, grain size distribution, and plasticity characteristics of the sediment. These results suggest that piping of lake sediment is the primary mechanism responsible for the formation of lake-bed depressions and lake level fluctuations.Investigating the potential and mechanism of soil piping causing water-level drops in Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mountain torque and its influence on the atmospheric angular momentum on Titan - ScienceDirectMountain torque and its influence on the atmospheric angular momentum on Titan - ScienceDirectMountain torque and its influence on the atmospheric angular momentum on Titan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectExploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectLand cover and environmental data from Peru were used in an econometric model.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectThe model assessed wetland hydrologic connectivity from 1987 to 1995.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectResults show changing glacier area and stream discharge drive wetland change.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectThis approach is useful when altered hydrological and climate regimes cause change.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectMore integration of econometric methods may facilitate interdisciplinary research.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectReceding mountain glaciers affect the hydrology of downslope ecosystems with consequences for drinking water, agriculture, and hydropower production. Here we combined land cover derived from satellite imagery and other environmental data from the northern Peruvian Andes into a first differencing regression model to assess wetland hydrologic connectivity. Wetland area was considered the response variable and a variety of land cover, climatic, and stream discharge explanatory variables were tested to evaluate effects of possible hydrologic connectivity. The results indicate that there were two primary spatial driving forces of wetland change in Peru's Cordillera Blanca from 1987 to 1995: 1) loss in glacier area was associated with increased wetland area, controlling for other factors; while 2) an increase in mean annual stream discharge in the previous 12 months increased wetland area. The general approach we used expands the ways that connectivity between landscape changes and hydrologic and ecosystem processes can be assessed.Exploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectThis research proposes relationships among peak water, glacier recession, changing glacier discharge, wetland area, and wetland ecosystem services with the approximate period of this study indicated by the grey shaded area.Download high-res image (178KB)Download full-size imageExploring hydrologic connections between tropical mountain wetlands and glacier recession in Peru's Cordillera Blanca - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Properties of soil organic matter in Podzols under mountain dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Each element of this set is extendable to a population monotonic interval allocation scheme or shortly pmias.

Limited research on its impacts, including studies comparing biking with hiking, contributes to the challenges for mangers in assessing its appropriateness. The impacts of mountain bike riding off trail were compared to those of hiking on subalpine grassland in Australia using a modification of a common trampling experimental methodology. Vegetation and soil parameters were measured immediately and two weeks after different intensities of mountain biking (none, 25, 75, 200 and 500 passes across slope, 200 pass up and down slope) and hiking (200 and 500 passes across slope). There were reductions in vegetation height, cover and species richness, as well as changes in species composition and increases in litter and soil compaction with riding. Riding up and down a moderate slope had a greater impact than riding across the slope. Hiking also affected vegetation height, cover and composition. Mountain biking caused more damage than hiking but only at high use (500 passes). Further research including other ecosystems, topography, styles of riding, and weather conditions are required, but under the conditions tested here, hiking and mountain biking appear to be similar in their environmental impacts.Assessing the impacts of mountain biking and hiking on subalpine grassland in Australia using an experimental protocol - ScienceDirectAssessing the impacts of mountain biking and hiking on subalpine grassland in Australia using an experimental protocol - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Early human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectEarly human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectWe found stone artifacts layers within several loess sections in the Hanzhong and Ankang Basins.Early human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectThe loess sections were dated by detailed magnetostratigraphic analyses.Early human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectEarly human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectEarly human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectEarly human settlements in the southern Qinling Mountains, central China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Properties of soil organic matter in Podzols under mountain dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Produced energy is understood as the transformation resulting from the production of grains or fruits, or dry matter, into energy. Consumed energy or cultural energy (MJ ha-1) is understood as the sum of the energy coefficients related to the fertilizers, seeds, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, incident solar energy during the cycle and operations related to sowing, fertilization, application of products and manual harvesting. Post-harvest is considered to be the sum of the energy coefficients spent in the pre-processing and processing operations used in each treatment. The present work aimed at evaluating the energy balance in a mountain coffee production system with emphasis on production, harvest and post-harvest. It was concluded that plants and their individual components take little advantage from the amount of energy aggregated in the energy balance (less than 0.3%).Energy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Energy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectExtract from the doctoral thesis of the second author.Energy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectEnergy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectEnergy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectEnergy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectEnergy balance in the production of mountain coffee - ScienceDirectBioprospecting for podophyllotoxin in the Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming - ScienceDirectThe objective of this study was to evaluate variations in podophyllotoxin concentrations in Juniperus species found in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming. It was found that Juniperus species in the Big Horn Mountains included three species; J. communis L. (common juniper), J. horizontalis Moench. (creeping juniper) and J. scopulorum Sarg. (Rocky Mountain juniper). Of these species, none of the 12 accessions of J. communis contained detectable amounts of podophyllotoxin. All accessions of J. scopulorum but one contained podophyllotoxin. Podophyllotoxin concentration in J. horizontalis and J. scopulorum did not correlate to the elevation of the selection sites. The concentration of podophyllotoxin in J. scopulorum ranged from 0 to 0.40%, while the concentration of podophyllotoxin in J. horizontalis ranged from 0.27 to 0.73%. Overall, J. horizontalis accessions in the Big Horn Mountains showed higher concentration of podophyllotoxin than the one in J. scopulorum. The range of concentrations in podophyllotoxin in J. horizontalis and J. scopulorum in the Big Horn Mountains were within the range or (in case of J. horizontalis), much higher than the ones reported previously for J. virginiana. This is the first report on podophyllotoxin in J. horizontalis. The concentrations of podophyllotoxin in some accessions of J. horizontalis were twice as high as the ones reported previously for any other junipers. This study demonstrated that Juniperus species in the Big Horn Mountains have a potential to be used as a source for podophyllotoxin.Bioprospecting for podophyllotoxin in the Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming - ScienceDirectBioprospecting for podophyllotoxin in the Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Practical aspects in mountain medicine education - ScienceDirectPractical aspects in mountain medicine education - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Characterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectCharacterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectThe Jafurah basin in Saudi Arabia possesses excellent shale gas attributes.Characterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectThe basin spreads over a large area equivalent in size to the Eagle Ford play.Characterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectA phased de-risking strategy is being implemented to explore this frontier basin.Characterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectTargeted zones exhibit high TOC/hydrocarbon saturation, and low clay content.Characterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectA reservoir quality prediction model was developed for sweet spot identification.Characterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectCharacterization of carbonate mudrocks of the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation, Jafurah basin, Saudi Arabia: Implications for unconventional reservoir potential evaluation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Concentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectConcentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectConcentrations of Frasnian cephalopods within carbonate concretions were found.Concentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectCephalopods suffered mass mortality during storm events shortly after mass spawning.Concentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectThe excellent preservation of the fossils resulted from rapid silicification.Concentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectThe age of the concentration has been determined as the linguiformis conodont Zone.Concentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectConcentrations of silicified cephalopods within upper Frasnian carbonate concretions from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrological conditions and carbon accumulation rates reconstructed from a mountain raised bog in the Carpathians: A multi-proxy approach - ScienceDirectHydrological conditions and carbon accumulation rates reconstructed from a mountain raised bog in the Carpathians: A multi-proxy approach - ScienceDirectPast hydrological variability and C accumulation in a mountain ombrogenous bogHydrological conditions and carbon accumulation rates reconstructed from a mountain raised bog in the Carpathians: A multi-proxy approach - ScienceDirectHydrological conditions and carbon accumulation rates reconstructed from a mountain raised bog in the Carpathians: A multi-proxy approach - ScienceDirectClimate directly influences peat's plant composition and thus C accumulation.Hydrological conditions and carbon accumulation rates reconstructed from a mountain raised bog in the Carpathians: A multi-proxy approach - ScienceDirectIncreased C accumulation in a wetter and warmer climate;

However, in our field survey in the east Qilian Mountains, we found that growth condition of Qinghai spruce under climate changes was better in anthropogenic management forest than disturbance-free stands. Accordingly, we suggested a hypothesis that the environmental change induced suppression in Qinghai spruce growth could be mitigated by anthropogenic management. Such a hypothesis was tested by comparing Qinghai spruce growth and population dynamic patterns between anthropogenic-managed forests and disturbance-free ones. We found that Qinghai spruce radial growth persistently declined since the late 1950s in the disturbance-free forests, while the radial growth of anthropogenic-managed trees almost kept steady-going trends since the 1970s in which anthropogenic-management appeared. Besides, some anomalous growth-declining years occurred in disturbance-free forests did not appear in anthropogenic-managed forests in the same year after anthropogenic-management emerged. Moreover, missing ring and tree mortality took place in disturbance-free stands and became increasingly frequent after the mid-1980s. The frequencies and proportions of missing rings and tree die-off were much lower in anthropogenic-managed forests than disturbance-free ones. Additionally, the occurrence of Qinghai spruce radial growth decline and increased mortality in recent time in our disturbance-free forests could be well explained by global-change-type drought in conjunction with elevated temperature and warming-related pest outbreaks. These results would be of fundamental significance for the further understanding of the changing forests, which could provide new clues for forest management and conservation in the future.Anthropogenic-management could mitigate declines in growth and survival of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) in the east Qilian Mountains, northeast Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Intercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectIntercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectThe validation of MODIS C5 and GLASS V3.0 is carried out over rugged surface.Intercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectThe percentage of product successful retrievals is vulnerable to complex topography.Intercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectThe consistency of the two products is dominated by biome other than topography.Intercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectIntercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectGLASS performs similarly to MODIS through comparison with mountain field LAI data.Intercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectIntercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectIntercomparison and validation of MODIS and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products over mountain areas: A case study in southwestern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Erosion helps keep mountains standing tall - ScienceDirectErosion helps keep mountains standing tall - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Physiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors - ScienceDirectPhysiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors - ScienceDirectMountain land use and climate warming are the main drivers of grasslands quality change.Physiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors - ScienceDirectGeneral tendency in the increase in biomass and greenness was mainly correlated with environmental factors.Physiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors - ScienceDirectNegative changes show degradation at localized patches mainly correlated by anthropogenic factors.Physiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors - ScienceDirectGrazing increase biomass and greenness at low stocking rates but reduce them at high.Physiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors - ScienceDirectMountain grasslands provide valuable ecosystem services for sustainable development and human wellbeing. These habitats have suffered important changes related with their physiognomic (biomass) and physiologic (greenness) properties. Some of these changes received significant attention i.e. woody encroachment, while others, like the changes in biomass and greenness of those grasslands that have not experienced woody encroachment are almost unknown. We calculated physiognomic and physiologic properties for dense grasslands not affected by woody encroachment through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper. Imagery taken in the late-1980s and late-2000s in the Spanish Pyrenees were analyzed with multi-temporal vectors to detect increases or decreases of biomass and greenness. To understand the source of these changes, we modeled them with anthropogenic (land use, i.e. grazing, ski resorts, and related infrastructures) and environmental factors (topographic, lithologic and climatic). Anthropogenic factors were most strongly correlated with decrease in the biomass and greenness, showing degradation patterns of the grasslands at localized patches. Nonetheless, environmental factors were most strongly correlated with positive changes in both indices, detecting a continuous pattern in the increase in biomass and greenness. In areas that had high livestock stocking rates, grasslands biomass and greenness decrease, while in areas that had low stocking rates, biomass and greenness increases. Grasslands at low elevation showing decrease in biomass and greenness were either on gentle slopes and largely affected by human activities, or on steep slopes locally affected by ski resorts. In areas that have been disturbed by anthropogenic factors, the increase of rain in early summer trigger erosion processes, enhancing the negative effect of anthropic pressure on grassland greenness and biomass. In contrast, grasslands at high elevations, on steep slopes, and those that had north or west aspects and that had an acidic lithology, with less continentality, and that received more rain, had the most increase in biomass and greenness. Those results suggest that changes in mountain grasslands, apart from woody encroachment, are deeply altering their physiology and physiognomy, pointing out direct relationships with current management practices and climate trends.Physiognomic and physiologic changes in mountain grasslands in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors -

ScienceDirectSpatially-explicit participatory planning is a relatively new approach for managing visitors to protected areas. In this study we used public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) mapping and global positioning system (GPS) tracking to monitor mountain bikers frequenting national parks for tourism and recreation in Northern Sydney, Australia. PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions.

The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM data set is one of the most complete and most widely used DEM data sets; it provides accurate information on elevations over bare land areas. However, the accuracy of SRTM data over vegetated mountain areas is relatively low as a result of the high relief and the penetration limitation of the C-band used for obtaining global DEM products. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of SRTM DEMs and correct them over vegetated mountain areas with small-footprint airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data, which can develop elevation products and vegetation products [e.g., vegetation height, Leaf Area Index (LAI)] of high accuracy. The assessing results show that SRTM elevations are systematically higher than those of the actual land surfaces over vegetated mountain areas. The mean difference between SRTM DEM and Lidar DEM increases with vegetation height, whereas the standard deviation of the difference increases with slope. To improve the accuracy of SRTM DEM over vegetated mountain areas, a regression model between the SRTM elevation bias and vegetation height, LAI, and slope was developed based on one control site. Without changing any coefficients, this model was proved to be applicable in all the nine study sites, which have various topography and vegetation conditions. The mean bias of the corrected SRTM DEM at the nine study sites using this model (absolute value) is 89% smaller than that of the original SRTM DEM, and the standard deviation of the corrected SRTM elevation bias is 11% smaller.A practical method for SRTM DEM correction over vegetated mountain areas - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Grove Mountains meteorite recovery and relevant data distribution service - ScienceDirectGrove Mountains meteorite recovery and relevant data distribution service - ScienceDirectGrove Mountains meteorite recovery and relevant data distribution service - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The central role of disturbances in mountain forests of Europe - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The central role of disturbances in mountain forests of Europe - ScienceDirectMountain permafrost landscapes of Yakutia - ScienceDirectAn analysis is made of the spectrum of altitudinal zonality of mountain permafrost landscapes of Yakutia.

Proteomic and transcriptomic research into these portions of the mountain pine beetle life cycle have shed light on physiological processes that were already known to play important roles (detoxification of host secondary metabolites, reproductive physiology, and biosynthesis of cryoprotectants) and have revealed new territory for research (immune response, stress physiology). We discuss our overall findings in the context of an insect that is spreading to a new geographic range and encountering new hosts and a changing climate.The Proteomics and Transcriptomics of Early Host Colonization and Overwintering Physiology in the Mountain Pine Beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mercury accumulation in the surface layers of mountain soils: A case study from the Karkonosze Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectMercury accumulation in the surface layers of mountain soils: A case study from the Karkonosze Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectMercury accumulation in the surface layers of mountain soils: A case study from the Karkonosze Mountains, Poland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Testing the efficacy of the glacial buzzsaw: insights from the Sredinny Mountains, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectTesting the efficacy of the glacial buzzsaw: insights from the Sredinny Mountains, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Testing the efficacy of the glacial buzzsaw: insights from the Sredinny Mountains, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectIndiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectIndiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectIndiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectIndiana bat colonies were smaller and bats displayed less fidelity to roosts than in the Midwest.Indiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectRoosts were mainly tall, solar-exposed pine snags, particularly yellow pine snags.Indiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectCreating or preserving large pine snags may aid Indiana bat recovery in this region.Indiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectConsider landscape context when developing conservation strategies for Indiana bats.Indiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectIndiana bats roost in ephemeral, fire-dependent pine snags in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectA global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectThis paper provides the first global estimate of C stored in mountain grasslands and shrublands.A global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectA global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectThis C is accounted for in a robust manner when considering the UNFCCC's mitigation objectives.A global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectA global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectA global estimate of carbon stored in the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands, and the implications for climate policy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Human impacts to mountain streams - ScienceDirectMountain streams are here defined as channel networks within mountainous regions of the world. This definition encompasses tremendous diversity of physical and biological conditions, as well as history of land use. Human effects on mountain streams may result from activities undertaken within the stream channel that directly alter channel geometry, the dynamics of water and sediment movement, contaminants in the stream, or aquatic and riparian communities. Examples include channelization, construction of grade-control structures or check dams, removal of beavers, and placer mining. Human effects can also result from activities within the watershed that indirectly affect streams by altering the movement of water, sediment, and contaminants into the channel. Deforestation, cropping, grazing, land drainage, and urbanization are among the land uses that indirectly alter stream processes. An overview of the relative intensity of human impacts to mountain streams is provided by a table summarizing human effects on each of the major mountainous regions with respect to five categories: flow regulation, biotic integrity, water pollution, channel alteration, and land use. This table indicates that very few mountains have streams not at least moderately affected by land use. The least affected mountainous regions are those at very high or very low latitudes, although our scientific ignorance of conditions in low-latitude mountains in particular means that streams in these mountains might be more altered than is widely recognized. Four case studies from northern Sweden (arctic region), Colorado Front Range (semiarid temperate region), Swiss Alps (humid temperate region), and Papua New Guinea (humid tropics) are also used to explore in detail the history and effects on rivers of human activities in mountainous regions. The overview and case studies indicate that mountain streams must be managed with particular attention to upstream/downstream connections, hillslope/channel connections, process domains, physical and ecological roles of disturbance, and stream resilience.Human impacts to mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Discriminating types of precipitation in Qilian Mountains, Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectHulugou River Basin (HRB) of Qilian Mountains, eastern edge of Tibetan Plateau.Discriminating types of precipitation in Qilian Mountains, Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectTraditional manual observations only record point-scale precipitation rather than regional-scale precipitation.

Neanderthals disappeared from the Cantabrian region at the time of the S-I glacial advance during a cold and wet period at the end of the MIS3. If they had adapted to environmental changes, including abrupt cold events (H6, H5) with important environmental consequences, factors other than environmental ones may have been the cause.

Hydrological models can be a useful tool for the anticipation of these events and the issuing of timely warnings. One of the main challenges of setting up such a system is finding appropriate model parameter values for ungauged catchments. Previous studies have shown that the transfer of parameter sets from hydrologically similar gauged catchments is one of the best performing regionalization methods. However, a remaining key issue is the identification of suitable descriptors of similarity. In this study, we use decision tree learning to explore parameter set transferability in the full space of catchment descriptors. For this purpose, a semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model is set up for 35 catchments in ten Chinese provinces. Hourly runoff data from in total 858 storm events are used to calibrate the model and to evaluate the performance of parameter set transfers between catchments. We then present a novel technique that uses the splitting rules of classification and regression trees (CART) for finding suitable donor catchments for ungauged target catchments. The ability of the model to detect flood events in assumed ungauged catchments is evaluated in series of leave-one-out tests. We show that CART analysis increases the probability of detection of 10-year flood events in comparison to a conventional measure of physiographic-climatic similarity by up to 20%. Decision tree learning can outperform other regionalization approaches because it generates rules that optimally consider spatial proximity and physical similarity. Spatial proximity can be used as a selection criteria but is skipped in the case where no similar gauged catchments are in the vicinity. We conclude that the CART regionalization concept is particularly suitable for implementation in sparsely gauged and topographically complex environments where a proximity-based regionalization concept is not applicable.Modeling flash floods in ungauged mountain catchments of China: A decision tree learning approach for parameter regionalization - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Contribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectContribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectComplex radiation environment at high-mountain altitude is measured.Contribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectThe contribution of secondary cosmic ray neutrons is explicitly obtained.Contribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectA model for assessment of the effective dose due to secondary cosmic ray particles for high mountain altitude is developed.Contribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectThe model is based on straightforward modelling of atmospheric cascade.Contribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectContribution of cosmic ray particles to radiation environment at high mountain altitude: Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with experimental data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Nontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectNontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectA sensitive and reliable UHPLC/QTOF-MS method was developed for the global metabolite profiling of Mountain Cultivated Ginseng (MCG) leaves.Nontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectApplication of UHPLC/QTOF-MS-based metabolomics approach together with multivariate statistical analysis for discriminating the cultivation age of MCG leaves ranging from 6 to 18 years and revealing 39 key age-dependent markers.Nontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectNontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectNontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Nontargeted metabolomics approach for the differentiation of cultivation ages of mountain cultivated ginseng leaves using UHPLC/QTOF-MS - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Natural foci of Borrelia lusitaniae in a mountain region of Central Europe - ScienceDirectLyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in Europe.

Two canopy and one sub-canopy tree species, (Vismia tomentosa, Clusiaceae, an as of yet unknown Lauracee, and Spirotheca rosea, Bombacaceae) were the experimental objects. Seasonal changes as well as a long-term (18 months) trend of increasing precipitation caused an inverse reaction of the TWC of the trees. Because of a rather unlimited water supply to the trees from a permanently high water content of the soil, transpiration followed mainly the atmospheric demand of water vapor, and increasing moisture hence reduced water loss by transpiration. It was hypothesized that in spite of the reduction in transpiratory water loss photosynthetic carbon acquisition would be not or less affected due to an increase in water use efficiency. Concomitant measurements of photosynthetic net CO2 uptake showed the expected increase of WUE in V. tomentosa and S. rosea, but no clear reaction of the Lauracee. Accompanying measurements of stem extension growth confirmed an undiminished growth of V. tomentosa and S. rosea but showed also suspended growth of the Lauracee during the wettest months. While TWC can be continuously monitored with the heat dissipation technique, WUE is determined by leaf porometry in campaigns for which access to the canopy is required. Simultaneous recordings of the gas exchange of leaves at 4 different positions in the crown of one of the experimental trees (V. tomentosa) showed the usability of the trait WUE in combination with the total daily water consumption as indicator set for assessing the response of trees to a subtly changing climate. However, not all tree species appear as likewise useful indicator trees.Water relations and photosynthetic water use efficiency as indicators of slow climate change effects on trees in a tropical mountain forest in South Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Climate change, poverty and livelihoods: adaptation practices by rural mountain communities in Nepal - ScienceDirectEffects of climate change tend to be more severe where people rely on weather dependent rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. In rural mountain communities with limited livelihood options, adaptive capacity is low due to limited information, poor access to services, and inequitable access to productive assets. Few studies have reported on the current status of rural and remote mountain areas in Nepal with little known about adaptation strategies in use. This article is based on a study in the remote mountainous Jumla District of Nepal to explore how climate change is affecting the livelihood of local communities and how different wellbeing groups are differentially impacted. Looking from a wellbeing lens, adaptation practices by households as well as local support mechanisms were explored to predict the severity of effects now and into the future. Using a climate vulnerability and capacity analysis (CVCA) process, major climate hazards and their effects on livelihood resources were analyzed. In addition, participatory social research methods were used to analyze the coping strategies of different wellbeing groups. Results show that changing weather patterns have significantly challenged the livelihoods of a community, experiencing resource degradation, food scarcity, lack of basic services, and increasing social inequalities. The changing climate is an additional burden to the poor people in the mountains who are already living in poverty, are vulnerable and excluded with predictions of additional risks to livelihoods and further inequity in the future.Climate change, poverty and livelihoods: adaptation practices by rural mountain communities in Nepal - ScienceDirectClimate change, poverty and livelihoods: adaptation practices by rural mountain communities in Nepal - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Climate change, poverty and livelihoods: adaptation practices by rural mountain communities in Nepal - ScienceDirectPopular Gentle is a PhD scholar at the School of Environmental Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Australia.

They are unique relatively natural ecosystems consisting of long-lived species in an otherwise densely populated human landscape. Despite this, centuries of intensive forest management in many of these forests have eclipsed evidence of natural processes, especially the role of disturbances in long-term forest dynamics. Recent trends of land abandonment and establishment of protected forests have coincided with a growing interest in managing forests in more natural states. At the same time, the importance of past disturbances highlighted in an emerging body of literature, and recent increasing disturbances due to climate change are challenging long-held views of dynamics in these ecosystems. Here, we synthesize aspects of this Special Issue on the ecology of mountain forest ecosystems in Europe in the context of broader discussions in the field, to present a new perspective on these ecosystems and their natural disturbance regimes. Most mountain forests in Europe, for which long-term data are available, show a strong and long-term effect of not only human land use but also of natural disturbances that vary by orders of magnitude in size and frequency. Although these disturbances may kill many trees, the forests themselves have not been threatened. The relative importance of natural disturbances, land use, and climate change for ecosystem dynamics varies across space and time. Across the continent, changing climate and land use are altering forest cover, forest structure, tree demography, and natural disturbances, including fires, insect outbreaks, avalanches, and wind disturbances. Projected continued increases in forest area and biomass along with continued warming are likely to further promote forest disturbances. Episodic disturbances may foster ecosystem adaptation to the effects of ongoing and future climatic change. Increasing disturbances, along with trends of less intense land use, will promote further increases in coarse woody debris, with cascading positive effects on biodiversity, edaphic conditions, biogeochemical cycles, and increased heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Together, this may translate to disturbance-mediated resilience of forest landscapes and increased biodiversity, as long as climate and disturbance regimes remain within the tolerance of relevant species. Understanding ecological variability, even imperfectly, is integral to anticipating vulnerabilities and promoting ecological resilience, especially under growing uncertainty. Allowing some forests to be shaped by natural processes may be congruent with multiple goals of forest management, even in densely settled and developed countries.A walk on the wild side: Disturbance dynamics and the conservation and management of European mountain forest ecosystems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A walk on the wild side: Disturbance dynamics and the conservation and management of European mountain forest ecosystems - ScienceDirectOligocene-Miocene burial and exhumation of the southernmost Gangdese mountains from sedimentary and thermochronological evidence - ScienceDirectOligocene-Miocene burial and exhumation of the southernmost Gangdese mountains from sedimentary and thermochronological evidence - ScienceDirectLow temperature thermochronology data were collected from the Kailas conglomerate and Gangdese batholith.Oligocene-Miocene burial and exhumation of the southernmost Gangdese mountains from sedimentary and thermochronological evidence - ScienceDirectThe Kailas conglomerate show a remarkably consistent stratigraphic architecture and dynamic mechanisms.Oligocene-Miocene burial and exhumation of the southernmost Gangdese mountains from sedimentary and thermochronological evidence - ScienceDirectThe regional uplift initiated during the deposition of the Kailas conglomerates.Oligocene-Miocene burial and exhumation of the southernmost Gangdese mountains from sedimentary and thermochronological evidence - ScienceDirectOligocene-Miocene burial and exhumation of the southernmost Gangdese mountains from sedimentary and thermochronological evidence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mountain Pass solutions for non-local elliptic operators - ScienceDirectMountain Pass solutions for non-local elliptic operators - ScienceDirectArchitecture of basin-mountain systems and their influences on gas distribution: A case study from the Sichuan basin, South China - ScienceDirectArchitecture of basin-mountain systems and their influences on gas distribution: A case study from the Sichuan basin, South China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Jettencave, Southern Harz Mountains, Germany: Geophysical observations and a structural model of a shallow cave in gypsum/anhydrite-bearing rocks - ScienceDirectThe Jettencave, Southern Harz Mountains, Germany: Geophysical observations and a structural model of a shallow cave in gypsum/anhydrite-bearing rocks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Endemism of plants in the Uluguru Mountains, Morogoro, Tanzania - ScienceDirectEndemism of plants in the Uluguru Mountains, Morogoro, Tanzania - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mountain torrents: Quantifying vulnerability and assessing uncertainties - ScienceDirectVulnerability assessment for elements at risk is an important component in the framework of risk assessment. The vulnerability of buildings affected by torrent processes can be quantified by vulnerability functions that express a mathematical relationship between the degree of loss of individual elements at risk and the intensity of the impacting process. Based on data from the Austrian Alps, we extended a vulnerability curve for residential buildings affected by fluvial sediment transport processes to other torrent processes and other building types. With respect to this goal to merge different data based on different processes and building types, several statistical tests were conducted. The calculation of vulnerability functions was based on a nonlinear regression approach applying cumulative distribution functions. The results suggest that there is no need to distinguish between different sediment-laden torrent processes when assessing vulnerability of residential buildings towards torrent processes. The final vulnerability functions were further validated with data from the Italian Alps and different vulnerability functions presented in the literature. This comparison showed the wider applicability of the derived vulnerability functions. The uncertainty inherent to regression functions was quantified by the calculation of confidence bands. The derived vulnerability functions may be applied within the framework of risk management for mountain hazards within the European Alps. The method is transferable to other mountain regions if the input data needed are available.Mountain torrents: Quantifying vulnerability and assessing uncertainties - ScienceDirectWaves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectWaves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectUnstructured wave model with buoy and satellite observations in the Red Sea.Waves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectRift valley orography provides dominant controls on wind and wave fields.Waves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectWaves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectAcross-basin winds at mountain gaps generate largest wave heights, notably at Tokar.Waves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectWaves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectWaves in the Red Sea: Response to monsoonal and mountain gap winds - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Characterization of atmospheric aerosols in the Adirondack Mountains using PIXE, SEM/EDX, and Micro-Raman spectroscopies - ScienceDirectWe are making detailed measurements of the composition of atmospheric aerosols collected in the Adirondack Mountains as a function of particle size using proton-induced X-ray emission, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Micro-Raman spectroscopy.

The mesoscale numerical simulation model WRF 3.0 was used to determine the regional circulation previous to the deep convection. GPS radio occultation data were used to validate the simulations. It was found that updrafts generated by mountain waves constitute a possible triggering mechanism during the storms initiation. A continuous wavelet transform analysis was applied to the vertical velocity. In all cases, large amplitude stationary waves were observed just before the initiation of convection, possibly triggering it. The horizontal direction of propagation and the corresponding horizontal and vertical wavelengths of both main modes were identified. Vertical velocity and convective inhibition index were found to be potential storm forecasting flags in this region.Severe hailstorms near Southern Andes in the presence of mountain waves - ScienceDirectSevere hailstorms near Southern Andes in the presence of mountain waves -

ScienceDirectThe structural evolution of basement-involved, or thick-skinned, fold-and-thrust belts is often affected by preexisting, inherited extensional faults within the basement. Here, a crustal-scale two-dimensional finite difference model with a visco-elasto-brittle/plastic rheology is applied to investigate the formation of fold-and-thrust belts as a result of tectonic inversion, from intracontinental extension to compression. We examine the influence of frictional strain weakening, varying surface process intensity and different crustal rheologies. Intense strain weakening results in narrow and deep basins with wide shear zone spacing during the extension phase and fault reactivation and localized uplift during inversion. Little weakening of shear zones results in thrusts cross-cutting pre-existing normal faults and the development of newly-formed thrusts in distal parts of the fold-and-thrust belt during inversion. Enhanced surface mass movement localizes deformation and uplift in the central part of mountain belts. Implementation of a weak upper crust (quartzite) leads to less localized deformation compared to a strong crust (quartz-diorite). We compare modelling results to the basement-involved Kopet Dagh Mountains, NE Iran, and discuss potential lateral variation of fault reactivation and erosion rates being responsible for deeper tectonic exhumation in the eastern part of the mountain belt, relative to the West and Central Kopet Dagh.Effects of reactivated extensional basement faults on structural evolution of fold-and-thrust belts: Insights from numerical modelling applied to the Kopet Dagh Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Different duration of high-altitude pre-exposure associated with the incidence of acute mountain sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectDifferent duration of high-altitude pre-exposure associated with the incidence of acute mountain sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectDifferent duration of high-altitude pre-exposure associated with the incidence of acute mountain sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectTotally, 1010 questionnaires were analyzed; 106, 76, and 828 trekkers had pre-exposure lasting at least 3 days (group 1), less than 3 days (group 2), and 0 days (group 3), respectively.

Identified periglacial features were classified into: (a) rock glacier-like landform; (b) slightly creeping debris-mantled slopes; (c) steep debris-mantled slopes; and (d) rock falls. Results obtained from sediment sample analysis suggest activity and passive movement of a rock glacier-like landform, albeit minimal. Wind seems to play an important role in Patriot Hills local geomorphology. Periglacial features such as slightly creeping debris-mantled slope appear to have preferred slope orientation. They are commonly found onto slopes where the katabatic wind flows down. Slopewash and groundwater movement processes may be limited or non-existent since most snow disappears through sublimationPeriglacial features in Patriot Hills, Ellsworth Mountains, Antarctica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analyzing land-use change scenarios for trade-offs among cultural ecosystem services in the Southern Rocky Mountains -

ScienceDirectThe model detected a gradient of MPB severity with satisfactory levels of error.Modeling a Historical Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreak Using Landsat MSS and Multiple Lines of Evidence - ScienceDirectMountain pine beetles are significant forest disturbance agents, capable of inducing widespread mortality in coniferous forests in western North America. Various remote sensing approaches have assessed the impacts of beetle outbreaks over the last two decades. However, few studies have addressed the impacts of historical mountain pine beetle outbreaks, including the 1970s event that impacted Glacier National Park. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for outbreak severity. We incorporate historical aerial and landscape photos, aerial detection survey data, a nine-year collection of satellite imagery and abiotic data. This study presents a remote sensing based framework to (1) relate measurements of canopy mortality from fine-scale aerial photography to coarse-scale multispectral imagery and (2) classify the severity of mountain pine beetle affected areas using a temporal sequence of Landsat data and other landscape variables. We sampled canopy mortality in 261 plots from aerial photos and found that insect effects on mortality were evident in changes to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time. We tested multiple spectral indices and found that a combination of NDVI and the green band resulted in the strongest model. We report a two-step process where we utilize a generalized least squares model to account for the large-scale variability in the data and a binary regression tree to describe the small-scale variability. The final model had a root mean square error estimate of 9.8% canopy mortality, a mean absolute error of 7.6% and an R2 of 0.82. The results demonstrate that a model of percent canopy mortality as a continuous variable can be developed to identify a gradient of mountain pine beetle severity on the landscape.Modeling a Historical Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreak Using Landsat MSS and Multiple Lines of Evidence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirectA hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirectTotal nitrogen deposition at Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) is modeled.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirectOnly a few percent of nitrogen deposition originates from eastern United States.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirect40% of total deposition at RMNP is from sources within that state of Colorado.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirect27% of nitrogen disposition is from the Front Range.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirectReduced nitrogen, other than the WON, makes up 66% of the deposition budget.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park - ScienceDirectChanges in ecosystem function at Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) are occurring because of nitrogen deposition associated with emissions of nitrogen from sources in Colorado as well as other areas of the North American continent and beyond. Nitrogen species are in both reduced and oxidized forms. A year-long monitoring program was initiated to better understand their origins as well as the complex chemistry occurring during transport from source to receptor. Specifically, the goals of the study were to characterize the atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen species in gaseous, particulate, and aqueous phases in RMNP and to identify the emission sources of these various species. The apportionment strategy was designed to focus on differentiating between sources within and outside the state of Colorado and then further differentiate between sources along the Front Range of Colorado and the rest of Colorado. It was also desirous to identify the relative contributions to atmospheric nitrogen species from mobile sources, agricultural activities, and large and small point sources within the state of Colorado. The Particle Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) module available in the chemical transport model, the Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions (CAMx), is used to develop first-principle estimates of the contributions from different areas of North America. The CAMx_PSAT results are combined with measured species concentrations in a receptor modeling approach to develop final estimates of source apportionment of the various species' concentrations and deposition.A hybrid modeling approach for estimating reactive nitrogen deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park -

Sixty rather distinctive displays of debris flows, rock avalanches, and debris avalanches have been mapped in the uppermost part of the territory. Unlike contemporary sporadic and low volume debris flows, ancient (Pleistocene and Lower Holocene) accumulations are a few orders of magnitude more extensive and were of considerable geomorphologic significance in forming the steep sections of mountain valleys and slopes. This geomorphic pattern does not hold for flow type slides, the source of which is material released as a consequence of numerous deep-seated landslides. Due to deep disruption of slopes, a few high-magnitude flow type landslides (e.g., rock avalanches), quite rare in flysch mid-mountain conditions, also occurred in the Late Holocene.Geomorphic evidence of ancient catastrophic flow type landslides in the mid-mountain ridges of the Western Flysch Carpathian Mountains (Czech Republic) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geomorphic evidence of ancient catastrophic flow type landslides in the mid-mountain ridges of the Western Flysch Carpathian Mountains (Czech Republic) - ScienceDirectNote: The original manuscript of this paper was received in April 2007.

(northern Iran), with the aim of reconstructing the rotation history and the origin of curvature of this orogenic chain. The analyzed deposits are the sedimentary successions of the Upper Red Formation (Miocene), Lower Red Formation (Oligocene) and Eocene clastic units. Paleomagnetic results indicate that the Alborz Mts. can be considered a secondary arc that originated as a linear mountain belt that progressively acquired its present day curvature through opposite vertical axis rotations along its strike. The curvature of the arc was entirely acquired after the middle-late Miocene, which is the age of the youngest investigated sediments (Upper Red Formation). Overall, our paleomagnetic data indicate that the Alborz Mts. can be considered an orocline.Oroclinal bending in the Alborz Mountains (Northern Iran): New constraints on the age of South Caspian subduction and extrusion tectonics - ScienceDirectOroclinal bending in the Alborz Mountains (Northern Iran): New constraints on the age of South Caspian subduction and extrusion tectonics - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (308KB)Download full-size imageOroclinal bending in the Alborz Mountains (Northern Iran): New constraints on the age of South Caspian subduction and extrusion tectonics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Distribution characteristics of plants in the Ungseokbong Mountain, Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea - ScienceDirectThis study was conducted 13 surveys from 2007 through 2012.

It not only deduces the solar radio flux as an important physical quantity for solar observations, but also deducts the flat field of the radio spectrometer to display the radio spectrogram clearly. In this paper, we first introduce the basic method of calibration based on the data of the solar radio spectrometer of Purple Mountain Observatory. We then analyze the variation of the calibration coefficients, and give the calibrated results for a few flares. These results are compared with those of the Nobeyama solar radio polarimeter and the hard X-ray observations of the RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) satellite, it is shown that these results are consistent with the characteristics of typical solar flare light curves. In particular, the analysis on the correlation between the variation of radio flux and the variation of hard X-ray flux in the pulsing phase of a flare indicates that these observations can be used to study the relevant radiation mechanism, as well as the related energy release and particle acceleration processes.Calibration of Solar Radio Spectrometer of the Purple Mountain Observatory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Calibration of Solar Radio Spectrometer of the Purple Mountain Observatory - ScienceDirectSupported by National Natural Science Foundation (11173064,11233008) and the B-Category Special Project in the Strategic Science and Technology Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB09000000).Calibration of Solar Radio Spectrometer of the Purple Mountain Observatory - ScienceDirectAn evaluation of methods for determining during-storm precipitation phase and the rain/snow transition elevation at the surface in a mountain basin - ScienceDirectAn evaluation of methods for determining during-storm precipitation phase and the rain/snow transition elevation at the surface in a mountain basin - ScienceDirectAn evaluation of methods for determining during-storm precipitation phase and the rain/snow transition elevation at the surface in a mountain basin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Wood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectWood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectWood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectAnnual peak discharge explained 79% of variance in interannual wood export.Wood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectVideo monitoring revealed wood transport at 15% bankfull flow during snowmelt diurnal hydrographs.Wood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectConceptual model and framework explain linkages between climate, hydrology, and wood processes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed.Wood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectWood export varies among decadal, annual, seasonal, and daily scale hydrologic regimes in a large, Mediterranean climate, mountain river watershed - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectIndividual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectHarsh winters may favour the evolution of enhanced spatial memory in resident birds.Individual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectWe tested spatial memory in chickadees from different elevations with radio frequency identification technology.Individual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectHigh-elevation birds outperformed low-elevation birds in a spatial memory task.Individual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectThis is the first test of spatial memory variation in a food-caching bird in the wild.Individual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectFor food-caching animals inhabiting environments with strong seasonal variation, harsh winter conditions may limit access to naturally available food and favour the evolution of enhanced spatial memory. Spatial memory enables animals to remember the locations of food caches for overwinter survival, therefore animals in harsher conditions may benefit more from more accurate spatial memory than conspecifics living under relatively mild conditions. Despite numerous laboratory studies lending indirect support to the hypothesis that a harsh environment favours the evolution of spatial memory, there is no direct evidence showing fitness consequences of variation in spatial memory. As a step towards evaluating this hypothesis in natural populations, we established spatial arrays of programmable bird feeders equipped with radio frequency identification technology (RFID) to test for individual variation in spatial memory in food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, at two elevations differing in winter climate severity. Individuals could only access food at a single rewarding feeder within an array of eight, and each individual had to learn the location of their unique rewarding feeder. Birds at higher elevations visited the arrays significantly more frequently than birds at lower elevations, suggesting more intense food caching. They also performed better at locating their rewarding feeder than birds from lower elevations. Individuals showing better performance participated in more overall trials, suggesting a link between food-caching propensity and memory performance, but higher overall levels of activity within each array yielded less accurate memory performance. Finally, rotating the arrays showed that birds relied specifically on spatial memory in order to locate their rewarding feeder. To our knowledge, this is the first explicit test of spatial memory performance in food-caching birds under natural conditions. Our results corroborate earlier laboratory-based work showing large individual variation in spatial memory performance and lay the groundwork for future investigation into the fitness consequences of individual variation and the evolution of spatial memory.Individual variation in spatial memory performance in wild mountain chickadees from different elevations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Increasing aeolian dust deposition to snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains inferred from snowpack, wet deposition, and aerosol chemistry - ScienceDirectIncreasing aeolian dust deposition to snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains inferred from snowpack, wet deposition, and aerosol chemistry - ScienceDirectSnowpack calcium can be used as a surrogate for aeolian dust deposition to snow.Increasing aeolian dust deposition to snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains inferred from snowpack, wet deposition, and aerosol chemistry - ScienceDirectIncreasing aeolian dust deposition to snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains inferred from snowpack, wet deposition, and aerosol chemistry - ScienceDirectIncreasing aeolian dust deposition to snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains inferred from snowpack, wet deposition, and aerosol chemistry - ScienceDirectA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectDescribed novel epidemiology and characteristics of SCL-90 pre- and post-high-altitude exposureA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectIdentified the associations between SCL-90 factors and AMSA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectIdentified the predictive role of baseline somatization score for AMSA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectFound associations between non-AMS-related symptoms and SCL-90 itemsA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectThe current study aimed to identify the predictive values of psychological factors that are evaluated by the Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90) for acute mountain sickness (AMS).A higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectA higher baseline somatization score at sea level as an independent predictor of acute mountain sickness - ScienceDirectAMS is correlated with the baseline somatization score at sea level, which was measured using the SCL-90.

Components are driven toward increased functionality, reliability, and weight savings. In the arena of mountain bike rear shocks, air shocks lead the way in both weight savings and user adjustment over their coil spring counterparts. Not only do air shocks allow multiple controls over both compression and rebound damping but they also allow easy control for rider sag, adjusting for varied sized riders and rider suspension travel preferences. They do so with significant weight saving over coil spring competitors. A downside to air shocks over coil are the thermal issues surrounding housing an air spring concentric with the shock damping mechanism as well as the seal-friction issues associated with containing the air. The continual compressing of the air and the air seal friction are thermal dynamics that coil shocks do not experience. Also, the insulation of the damper mechanism by the air spring constrains more heat in the air shock. The net result of these thermal complexities is that air shocks typically get much hotter than coil shocks and as such cannot easily be used in continual high load riding scenarios such as downhill racing and long distance downhill riding. This paper examines some of these issues by developing a mountain bike rear air shock model incorporating air spring and frictional thermal effects. Heat is generated by compression and friction, stored in material and air thermal capacitances, and transferred between system elements and eventually to atmosphere. Damper energy generation effects are ignored in this paper and saved for a future study. The effects of shock design on thermal time constants and maximum temperatures are evaluated. Certain model predictions are compared to laboratory data.Sequence stratigraphy of the late middle Jurassic open shelf platform of the Tuwaiq Mountain Limestone Formation, central Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectMiddle Jurassic (Callovian) strata of Tuwaiq Mountain Limestone Formation, central Saudi Arabia are composed of thin- to thick-bedded, grainy and muddy limestones and dolostones with various skeletal and nonskeletal components. Facies analysis documents low- to high-energy environments, including lagoon, back reef, reef framework, fore-reef and intra-shelf basin lithofacies associations. Because of the narrow lateral distribution of facies and the presence of distinctive fossils, the depositional system likely represents an open marine shelf. Two third-order depositional sequences can be distinguished in the stratigraphic measured section. Transgressive sequences show deepening-upward trends, in which shallow water (lagoonal and back reef) facies are overlain by deeper-water (fore-reef and intra-shelf basin) facies. Regressive sequences show shallowing-upward trends in which deep-water facies are overlain by shallow-water facies. Most sequence boundaries in the study area are of the nonerosional (SB2) type. Correlation of depositional sequences in the studied section reveals that relatively shallow marine conditions predominated in the area.Sequence stratigraphy of the late middle Jurassic open shelf platform of the Tuwaiq Mountain Limestone Formation, central Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Drainage Retention Capacity (DREC) of Krisak Mountain Meadows Agricultural Area (Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic) for Mitigation of Negative Impacts of Climate Change - ScienceDirectDrainage Retention Capacity (DREC) of Krisak Mountain Meadows Agricultural Area (Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic) for Mitigation of Negative Impacts of Climate Change - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Data Research and Consulting.Contrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectContrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectIn stream, spatial density of wood decreased nonlinearly as channel width increased.Contrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectIn river, spatial density of wood increased with increasing channel width.Contrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectPatterns of wood storage depend on the ratio of channel width to riparian tree height.Contrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectRelation between total and specific wood storage differs between stream and river.Contrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectContrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Personal and Professional Profile of Mountain Medicine Physicians - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to define and describe the personal and professional profile of mountain medicine physicians including general physical training information and to include a detailed overview of the practice of mountain sports.Personal and Professional Profile of Mountain Medicine Physicians - ScienceDirectPersonal and Professional Profile of Mountain Medicine Physicians - ScienceDirectDetailed results have been provided for gender, age, marital status, general training frequency and methods, professional status, additional medical qualifications, memberships in professional societies and alpine clubs, mountain sports practice, and injuries sustained during the practice of mountain sports.Personal and Professional Profile of Mountain Medicine Physicians - ScienceDirectThis study has provided a detailed overview concerning the personal and professional profile of mountain medicine physicians.

At altitude, his blood glucose levels began to rise, necessitating increased insulin delivery. Typical symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) developed, and he became increasingly hyperglycemic and unwell. Upon presentation to an emergency clinic, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was diagnosed and was managed with insulin, intravenous fluids with potassium, and acetazolamide orally. No other potential causes for diabetic ketoacidosis were identified. Hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis resolved with treatment as expected, but an increased insulin requirement was noted for the next 48 hours, until returning to expected levels when acetazolamide was discontinued. This case describes an episode of mild diabetic ketoacidosis potentially precipitated by moderate to severe acute mountain sickness, and an apparent hyperglycemic effect of acetazolamide. Individuals with type 1 diabetes traveling to altitude and their physicians should be vigilant for this complication and should be aware of the effects of conventional first-line therapies for acute mountain sickness on insulin requirement, glycemic control, and preexisting microvascular diabetes complications.Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Acute Mountain Sickness: Case Report and Review of Treatment Options in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectAn integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectAndosolization is the main process affecting pedogenesis.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoils at highest latitudes have high analytical proximity with underlying bedrock.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectSoils at lowest latitudes have volcanic fingerprint.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectPSD analysis identifies great soil homogeneity with a fine silt aeolian component.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectOver recent decades, andic soils have been increasingly found in non-volcanic mountain ecosystems (NVME) in many parts of the world. In Italy, this type of soil has proved to be greatly affected by aeolian deposits and to be widely distributed geographically.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectHowever, there are still many open questions, especially regarding the genesis of these soils. This paper focuses on five representative pedons taken from NVME. Soil forming processes and relationships between soil and underlying bedrock were investigated by using an integrated approach including geochemical, magnetic, mineralogical, micromorphological and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. The 5 pedons showed andic character and similar morphology and micromorphology (e.g. silt illuviation, pedorelicts), as well as large differences in terms of soil reaction and clay mineralogy. The analysis of the vertical distribution of C, Al and Fe extracted in pyrophosphate along with related geochemical indices (e.g. Cp/Alp) enabled us to indicate andosolization as the main process of soil formation and to exclude podzolization. With respect to the soil-bedrock relationship, 2 soils showed great similarity to the underlying bedrock along with a clear aeolian particle size distribution footprint, whereas, in the remaining 3 soils, there was a clear soil-bedrock discontinuity and an evident volcanic fingerprint. Some of the soil-bedrock differences related to the geographical settings and latitude.An integrated approach to studying the genesis of andic soils in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Landscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectLandscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectMountain pine beetle and forest harvest effects on subsequent fire were assessed.Landscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectChange in percent canopy cover was calculated from multi-temporal LiDAR.Landscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectHigher MPB tree mortality yielded greater fire-induced reduction in canopy cover.Landscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectOlder harvest treatments also saw greater reduction in canopy cover from fire.Landscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectLandscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Morphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia - ScienceDirectMorphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia - ScienceDirectMorphotectonics of the Tunka rift is in accordance with deep geodynamic processes of the region.Morphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia - ScienceDirectThe Tunka rift basins are complicated by inversion deformations.Morphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia - ScienceDirectThe India-Asia collision on the development of the Tunka rift is very significant and well pronounced also.Morphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia - ScienceDirectMorphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia - ScienceDirectThe peculiarities of the neotectonic structure of the Tunka rift, which are clearly expressed morphologically as is typical of the Baikal rift system, as well as its unique features are in accordance with deep geodynamic processes of the region. On the other hand, the development of the rift basin structures of the southwestern area near Baikal is complicated by inversion deformations. Local uplifts followed by deformations of the basin sedimentary cover and inverted morphostructures expressed in relief are fixed against the background of the general subsidence of blocks of the pre-Cenozoic basement grabens. The Tunka rift has repeatedly experienced inversion deformations throughout its history. The last wave of such deformations involved the southwestern region near Baikal in the second half of the late Pleistocene. During the Quaternary, the positive component prevailed in the whole range of vertical movements of the inter-rift and interbasin blocks; since the late Neogene, these structures have experienced a slow but steady uplift, accompanied by their extension at the expense of the bordering basins.Morphotectonics of the Tunka rift and its bordering mountains in the Baikal rift system, Russia -

ScienceDirectThree-dimensional (3D) modeling and restoration are powerful in describing the geological characteristics and kinematics which cannot be fully accomplished by the two-dimensional modeling methods. In this study, we applied 3D modeling and restoration to the Beisantai anticline along the mountain front of the Northern Tianshan. The Beisantai anticline shows an EW-trending structure in the shallow layers with NS-trending structures in the deep layers. The 3D seismic reflection data visualize the growth strata well, which record the evolution of the anticline and the influence of Cenozoic India-Asian collision. Our results suggest that a combination of multiple deformations of this anticline on different layers developed during different episodes. In addition, multiphase deformation and strain distribution along the eastern part of the northern Tianshan was implied. Combined with an analysis of the burial and hydrocarbon-generating history from borehole data, we proposed new potential exploration areas in this region and multistage tectonic effects for hydrocarbon accumulation. This work not only highlights our understanding of the structural decomposition of a multiphase structure associated with growth strata, but also the structural evolution of the northern Tianshan and the adjacent petroleum-producing Junggar Basin.Multiphase deformation deduced from 3D construction and restoration: Implication for the hydrocarbon exploration in the mountain front of the Northern Tianshan -

Insights and Implications From Long-Term Monitoring in the Austrian Alps - ScienceDirectThe intensifying retreat of mountain glaciers is a highly visible indicator of global climate change and affects local geomorphological processes and hydrology. In the Austrian Alps, pictures and maps of glaciers date back to the early 17th century. Regular length change surveys started in 1891, glacier runoff measurements in 1897, and mass balance data in 1953. Glacier inventories have mapped area changes of all glaciers since the Little Ice Age. Long time series and high data density allow a discussion of the representativeness of monitored glaciers, supporting the setup of measurements in other mountain regions. Length changes are being measured for about 10% of all glaciers, all other parameters on less than 1%. Each parameter captures different aspects of recession, for example inventories and fluctuations reflect spatial, mass balance, and runoff temporal variabilities. The representativity of measured glaciers for the total sample changes over time. Glacier disintegration, debris cover, and proglacial lakes are challenging for future monitoring. A large enough number of monitoring areas is needed to ensure the supply of reliable data for developing local adaptation measures and process models for other regions in the world.What Future for Mountain Glaciers?
