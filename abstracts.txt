In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.VIIRS Nightfire Remote Sensing Volcanoes - ScienceDirectA new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons -

ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.Data assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectData assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectEnsemble Kalman Filter is applied for volcano data assimilation in 3D.Data assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectEnKF is a robust multi-data stream inversion approach for assessing volcanic unrest.Data assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectSensitivity tests are conducted to optimize EnKF strategies for geodetic data.Data assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectIntra-EnKF iterations improve EnKF forecasts for temporally limited InSAR.Data assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectEnKF provides optimization strategies for data collection when equipment is limited.Data assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectData assimilation strategies for volcano geodesy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Atmospheric-ionospheric disturbances following the April 2015 Calbuco volcano from GPS and OMI observations - ScienceDirectElectromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectElectromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectDiscussion on superimposed EM signals related to the 2010-2011 seismvolcanic crisis of Taal volcano (Philippines).Electromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectVolcano monitoring can be effective by continuous magnetotelluric data processing if the setting of stations is well-adapted.Electromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectElectric signals appear before the crisis and are superimposed to possible resistivity variations.Electromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectResults give a frame for monitoring active volcanoes with Electromagnetic devices.Electromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectElectromagnetic signals on active volcanoes: Analysis of electrical resistivity and transfer functions at Taal volcano (Philippines) related to the 2010 seismovolcanic crisis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectData on the geology, petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of rocks from Kamen Volcano (Central Kamchatka Depression) are presented and compared with rocks from the neighbouring active volcanoes. The rocks from Kamen and Ploskie Sopky volcanoes differ systematically in major elemental and mineral compositions and could not have been produced from the same primary melts. The compositional trends of Kamen stratovolcano lavas and dikes are clearly distinct from those of Klyuchevskoy lavas in all major and trace element diagrams as well as in mineral composition. However, lavas of the monogenetic cones on the southwestern slope of Kamen Volcano are similar to the moderately high-Mg basalts from Klyuchevskoy and may have been derived from the same primary melts. This means that the monogenetic cones of Kamen Volcano represent the feeding magma for Klyuchevskoy Volcano. Rocks from Kamen stratovolcano and Bezymianny form a common trend on all major element diagrams, indicating their genetic proximity. This suggests that Bezymianny Volcano inherited the feeding magma system of extinct Kamen Volcano. The observed geochemical diversity of rocks from the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes can be explained as the result of both gradual depletion over time of the mantle N-MORB-type source due to the intense previous magmatic events in this area, and the addition of distinct fluids to this mantle source.Relationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectRelationship between Kamen Volcano and the Klyuchevskaya group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges - ScienceDirectAscent of magma through Earth's crust is normally associated with, among other effects, ground deformation and gravity changes. Geodesy is thus a valuable tool for monitoring and hazards assessment during volcanic unrest, and it provides valuable data for exploring the geometry and volume of magma plumbing systems. Recent decades have seen an explosion in the quality and quantity of volcano geodetic data. New datasets (some made possible by regional and global scientific initiatives), as well as new analysis methods and modeling practices, have resulted in important changes to our understanding of the geodetic characteristics of active volcanism and magmatic processes, from the scale of individual eruptive vents to global compilations of volcano deformation. Here, we describe some of the recent developments in volcano geodesy, both in terms of data and interpretive tools, and discuss the role of international initiatives in meeting future challenges for the field.Volcano Geodesy: Recent developments and future challenges -

Elemental composition, percentage of fine particles and loss on ignition were determined in sediment layers of eleven gravity cores retrieved from four mud volcanoes (Sagres, Bonjardim, Soloviev and Porto) and three undefined structures located on the deep Portuguese margin of the Gulf of Cadiz. Calcium was positively correlated to Sr and inversely to Al as well as to most of the trace elements. Vertical profiles of Ba, Cd and As concentrations, and their ratios to Al, in Porto and Soloviev showed pronounced enhancements in the top 50-cm depth. Sub-surface enhancements were less pronounced in other mud volcanoes and were absent in sediments from the structures. These profiles were interpreted as diagenetic enrichments related to the anaerobic oxidation of methane originated from upward methane-rich fluxes. The observed barium fronts were most likely caused by the presence of barite which precipitated at the sulphate-methane transition zone. Cd and As enrichments have probably resulted from successive dissolution/precipitation of sulphides in response to vertical shifts of redox boundaries.Vertical distribution of major, minor and trace elements in sediments from mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz: evidence of Cd, As and Ba fronts in upper layers -

To this aim, in the last decade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have been proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a function of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is possible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up to now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon tracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion planes.Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirectUsing telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique, we propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting of the Cherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after crossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is imaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to reconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the advantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution.Volcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirectVolcanoes muon imaging using Cherenkov telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Remote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectRemote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectDamavand volcano is investigated using both day and nighttime satellite imageries.Remote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectSurface thermal anomalies occur around the volcano based on TIR data.Remote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectThe close spatial relationships exist between thermal anomalies and geothermal manifestations.Remote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectRelationship between thermal anomalies, hydrothermal alterations and volcano-induced deformation were explored quantitatively.Remote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectArc-shaped pattern of thermal anomalies may explain with proposed tectonic setting.Remote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectRemote sensing of Damavand volcano (Iran) using Landsat imagery: Implications for the volcano dynamics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectLong-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectPressure variations measured within the conduit of a MV system provide insights on sensitivity to ambient pressure changesLong-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectEarthquake events have been recorded by the observatory in relation to local geology, tectonic settings and fault geometryLong-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectPeak ground acceleration can be used as a proxy to estimate triggering thresholds of MVs activity in the near-fieldLong-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectSignals not related to external triggers give hints on the internal dynamics of the Athina MVLong-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectLong-term in situ observations at the Athina mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Taking the pulse of mud volcanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Quantification of carbon dioxide emissions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (Eastern-Central Europe, Romania) - ScienceDirectQuantification of carbon dioxide emissions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (Eastern-Central Europe, Romania) - ScienceDirectWe present the first estimation of CO2 flux (focused emissions and diffuse soil degassing) from a seemingly inactive volcano from Eastern-Central Europe.Quantification of carbon dioxide emissions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (Eastern-Central Europe, Romania) - ScienceDirectQuantification of carbon dioxide emissions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (Eastern-Central Europe, Romania) - ScienceDirectThe flux data is consistent with other research from petrology and geophysics that indicate degassing of a deep seated magmatic body.Quantification of carbon dioxide emissions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (Eastern-Central Europe, Romania) - ScienceDirectQuantification of carbon dioxide emissions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (Eastern-Central Europe, Romania) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) for volcano monitoring in two dimensions: Opportunities and challenges.

Prominent depletion in volatiles confirms the anomalous behavior of the Tolbachik fluid systems. Vitreous basalts contain minor amounts of water (0.16-0.27 wt.%) and carbon dioxide (95-440 ppm). New data on volatiles in the Tolbachik plagioclase lapilli show very low contents of CO2 and total gas (exclusive of H2O) and enrichment in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) relative to the basalts. In general, analysis of basalts and plagioclase lapilli from different eruptions trace a progressive increase in reduced fluids (CO and CH4) and decrease in CO2 and total gas from past to present events. The concentrations of CO2 decrease, while those of CO and CH4 in basalts and plagioclase lapilli increase systematically with an increase in FeO/MgO ratios and K2O contents in the lavas and in anorthite component in plagioclase.Genesis of volatiles in suprasubduction basaltic melts from Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Families of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectFamilies of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectPresence of characteristic repeating events in Yasur seismicityFamilies of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectFamilies of repeating explosion quakes and deeper events have been identified.Families of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectFamilies represent modes of oscillations of specific parts of the volcanic conduit.Families of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectTemporal evolution of families can be influenced by external and internal factors.Families of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectFamilies of similar events and modes of oscillation of the conduit at Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Walking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectWalking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectNew findings within Roccamonfina paleontological siteWalking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectReport on what is probably the oldest human fossil path or trackway ever foundWalking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectMultiple occupation/use of topographic benches and terracesWalking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectArchaeology and 3D modelling to demonstrate actuality of ichnological evidenceWalking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectWalking along the oldest human fossil pathway (Roccamonfina volcano, Central Italy)? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Detection of plumes at Redoubt and Etna volcanoes using the GPS SNR method - ScienceDirectDetection of plumes at Redoubt and Etna volcanoes using the GPS SNR method - ScienceDirectDetection of Plumes at Redoubt and Etna Volcanoes using the GPS SNR MethodDetection of plumes at Redoubt and Etna volcanoes using the GPS SNR method - ScienceDirectKristine M.

We show that this easily recorded type of seismicity is usually the earliest reported precursor to eruptions and show that the total energy released during this seismicity is an excellent proxy for the intruded magma volume. It is therefore extremely useful for eruption forecasting. We present several case studies showing its forecasting value for eruptions ranging from VEI explosivity 0 to 6, and for magma types ranging from basaltic to dacitic.Volcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectGeochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectGeochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectTrace element analyses on tephras from the Ulleung and Baegdusan (Changbai) volcanoes.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe Ulleung volcano is similar to the ordinary intraplate volcanoes.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe Baegdusan volcano resulted from both contributions of the stagnant Pacific plate and overlying asthenospheric mantle.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe intraplate Baegdusan (Changbai) and Ulleung volcanoes located on the border of China, North Korea, and East/Japan Sea, respectively, have been explained by appeals to both hotspots and asthenospheric mantle upwelling (wet plume) caused by the stagnant Pacific plate. To understand the origin of the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanism, we performed geochemical analyses on the tephra deposits in the East/Japan Sea basins originating from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes. The volcanic glass in the tephra from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes ranged from alkaline trachyte to peralkaline rhyolite and from phonolite to trachyte, respectively. The tephra from the two intraplate volcanoes showed highly enriched incompatible elements, such as Tb, Nb, Hf, and Ta, distinct from those of the ordinary arc volcanoes of the Japanese islands. The straddle distribution of the Th/Yb and Ta/Yb ratios of the tephra deposits from the Baegdusan volcano may originate from the alkali basaltic magma resulting from mixing between the wet plume from the stagnant Pacific plate in the transition zone and the overlying shallow asthenospheric mantle. In contrast, the deposits from the Ulleung volcano show a minor contribution of the stagnant slab to the basaltic magma, implying either partial melting of a more enriched mantle, smaller degrees of partial melting of a garnet-bearing mantle source, or a combination of both processes as the magma genesis. Our study indicated that the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes have different magma sources and evolutionary histories.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes -

This wide back-arc lava plateau, with hundreds of monogenetic pyroclastic cones, covers a large area behind the active Andean volcanic arc. Here we focus on the northern Llancanelo volcanic field, particularly in Las Bombas volcano. Las Bombas volcano is an eroded, but still recognizable, scoria cone located in a circular depression surrounded by a basaltic lava flow, suggesting that Las Bombas volcano was there when the lava flow field formed and, therefore, the lava flow engulfed it completely. While this explanation seems reasonable, the common presence of similar landforms in this part of the field justifies the need to establish correctly the stratigraphic relationship between lava flow fields and these circular depressions. The main purpose of this research is to investigate Las Bombas volcano 3D subsurface architecture by means of geophysical methods. We carried out a paleomagnetic study and detailed topographic, magnetic and gravimetric land surveys. Magnetic anomalies of normal and reverse polarity and paleomagnetic results point to the occurrence of two different volcanic episodes. A circular low Bouguer anomaly was detected beneath Las Bombas scoria cone indicating the existence of a mass deficit. A 3D forward gravity model was constructed, which suggests that the mass deficit would be related to the presence of fracture zones below Las Bombas volcano cone, due to sudden degassing of younger magma beneath it, or to a single phreatomagmatic explosion. Our results provide new and detailed information about Las Bombas volcano subsurface architecture.Subsurface architecture of Las Bombas volcano circular structure (Southern Mendoza, Argentina) from geophysical studies - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Juvenile magma recognition and eruptive dynamics inferred from the analysis of ash time series: The 2015 reawakening of Cotopaxi volcano - ScienceDirectJuvenile magma recognition and eruptive dynamics inferred from the analysis of ash time series: The 2015 reawakening of Cotopaxi volcano - ScienceDirectJuvenile ash fragments are recognized in Cotopaxi ash based on the presence of unaltered glass containing few microlites.

Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-year-long thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system. This provides a remarkable support for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting, particularly in remote areas where permanent ground data acquisition is hazardous, expensive and difficult.Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectLong- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectNear- and far-field earthquakes can trigger the eruption of mud volcanoes.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectResponse of mud volcanoes to earthquakes can occur in the short- and long term.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectBoth static and dynamic stresses influence eruptions.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectLong- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Differences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectMaterial failure forecast method tested as means to predict volcanic eruption timeDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectApplied to precursory seismic energy for 2007 and 2014 eruptions of Kelud volcanoDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectFailed to provide useful predictions of eruption times for 2007 and 2014 eruptionsDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectRevealed differences in precursory energy release of effusive and Plinian eruptionsDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDifferences may reflect different processes before effusive and Plinian eruptions.Differences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectAutomatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectVolcano event durations are modeled in the HMM framework.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectState duration are modeling with max and min bounds.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectEvent duration are modeled with max and min bounds and with a gamma distribution.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectNew event penalization is incorporated to reduce false positives.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectIn this paper we propose an automatic volcano event detection system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with state and event duration models. Since different volcanic events have different durations, therefore the state and whole event durations learnt from the training data are enforced on the corresponding state and event duration models within the HMM. Seismic signals from the Llaima volcano are used to train the system. Two types of events are employed in this study, Long Period (LP) and Volcano-Tectonic (VT). Experiments show that the standard HMMs can detect the volcano events with high accuracy but generates false positives. The results presented in this paper show that the incorporation of duration modeling can lead to reductions in false positive rate in event detection as high as 31% with a true positive accuracy equal to 94%. Further evaluation of the false positives indicate that the false alarms generated by the system were mostly potential events based on the signal-to-noise ratio criteria recommended by a volcano expert.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectSohail Masood is now with the Department of Computer Science, University of Lahore, Gujrat Campus, Pakistan.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectSalman Khan is now with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar, Pakistan.Detection of plumes at Redoubt and Etna volcanoes using the GPS SNR method - ScienceDirectDetection of plumes at Redoubt and Etna volcanoes using the GPS SNR method - ScienceDirectDetection of Plumes at Redoubt and Etna Volcanoes using the GPS SNR MethodDetection of plumes at Redoubt and Etna volcanoes using the GPS SNR method - ScienceDirectKristine M.

We show that this easily recorded type of seismicity is usually the earliest reported precursor to eruptions and show that the total energy released during this seismicity is an excellent proxy for the intruded magma volume. It is therefore extremely useful for eruption forecasting. We present several case studies showing its forecasting value for eruptions ranging from VEI explosivity 0 to 6, and for magma types ranging from basaltic to dacitic.Volcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano-tectonic earthquakes: A new tool for estimating intrusive volumes and forecasting eruptions - ScienceDirectGeochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectGeochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectTrace element analyses on tephras from the Ulleung and Baegdusan (Changbai) volcanoes.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe Ulleung volcano is similar to the ordinary intraplate volcanoes.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe Baegdusan volcano resulted from both contributions of the stagnant Pacific plate and overlying asthenospheric mantle.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe intraplate Baegdusan (Changbai) and Ulleung volcanoes located on the border of China, North Korea, and East/Japan Sea, respectively, have been explained by appeals to both hotspots and asthenospheric mantle upwelling (wet plume) caused by the stagnant Pacific plate. To understand the origin of the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanism, we performed geochemical analyses on the tephra deposits in the East/Japan Sea basins originating from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes. The volcanic glass in the tephra from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes ranged from alkaline trachyte to peralkaline rhyolite and from phonolite to trachyte, respectively. The tephra from the two intraplate volcanoes showed highly enriched incompatible elements, such as Tb, Nb, Hf, and Ta, distinct from those of the ordinary arc volcanoes of the Japanese islands. The straddle distribution of the Th/Yb and Ta/Yb ratios of the tephra deposits from the Baegdusan volcano may originate from the alkali basaltic magma resulting from mixing between the wet plume from the stagnant Pacific plate in the transition zone and the overlying shallow asthenospheric mantle. In contrast, the deposits from the Ulleung volcano show a minor contribution of the stagnant slab to the basaltic magma, implying either partial melting of a more enriched mantle, smaller degrees of partial melting of a garnet-bearing mantle source, or a combination of both processes as the magma genesis. Our study indicated that the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes have different magma sources and evolutionary histories.Geochemical fingerprint of the primary magma composition in the marine tephras originated from the Baegdusan and Ulleung volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Review of ten years of volcano deformations recorded by the ground-based InSAR monitoring system at Stromboli volcano: a tool to mitigate volcano flank dynamics and intense volcanic activity - ScienceDirectStromboli volcano (Southern Italy) is one of the most monitored volcano in the world with a surveillance network that includes a permanently sited ground-based SAR interferometer (GBInSAR). This work is the review of the GBInSAR data gained from the last decade of monitoring activity. The analysis of the entire dataset of GBInSAR measurements allowed the assessment of the deformation field of the northern part of the summit crater area and the Sciara del Fuoco depression. In detail, the main displacements recognized can be related to different factors: 1) the inflation/deflation respectively immediately before and after each new effusive event; 2) the bulging of localized sectors of the volcano involved in the vent opening; 3) the gravitational sliding of the Sciara del Fuoco infill; 4) the movement of lava flows. Accelerations in this sector are related to sheet intrusions, while the possibility of vent opening, associated with small sliding, or catastrophic flank failure are related to highly overpressurized sheets, able to produce high displacement rate in the Sciara del Fuoco.Review of ten years of volcano deformations recorded by the ground-based InSAR monitoring system at Stromboli volcano: a tool to mitigate volcano flank dynamics and intense volcanic activity - ScienceDirectIn the summit crater area, the increases in the displacement rate are related to the pressurization of the shallow conduit system, as the consequence of the variation in the magma level (magmastatic pressure) or to the lateral magma migration (lateral conduit expansion or dike intrusion) in response to the increase of the overpressure component. Fluctuations in the displacement rate in the summit crater area can be related to the magma overturning within the conduit, with the increases in displacement rate during the upwelling of less dense magma, while displacement rate decreases as the degassed magma column is pushed out from the conduit (lava flows or overflows). Instead, the decrease in the displacement rate without coeval lava outpouring could be related to the sink of the degassed magma due to density contrast between the gas-poor and the gas-charged magmas. Using the displacement rate in the summit crater area as a proxy for the variation in the pressure condition in conduit (both magmastatic and overpressure components), thresholds for the crises characterized by the occurrence of overflows (eventually associated with major explosions) and flank effusions (eventually associated with paroxysmal explosions) are identified. Small conduit overpressure will produce overflows (sometimes associated with crater-rim collapses), while large magma overpressure will laterally expand the conduit forming NE-SW striking sheets, feeding eruptive vents at the base of the summit crater area and within the Sciara del Fuoco, generating conditions of instability that can evolve into catastrophic collapse of the instable flank.Causes of distal volcano-tectonic seismicity inferred from hydrothermal modeling -

Diurnal variations occur only in the coolest fourth fumarole, where gas temperature, gas pressure and CO2 concentration are inversely correlated with atmospheric pressure.

This study presents an overview of plumbing systems imaged at different depths and geodynamic settings, in order to contribute to assessing the factors that control their geometry. Data were derived from personal field surveys and through the analysis of publications; observations include local lithology and tectonics of the host rock with special reference to local fault kinematics and related stress tensor, regional tectonics (general kinematics and far-field stress tensors), geology and shape of the volcano, topographic settings, and structural and petrochemical characteristics of the plumbing system. Information from active volcanoes and eroded extinct volcanoes is discussed; the shallow plumbing system of active volcanoes has been reconstructed by combining available geophysical data with field information derived from outcropping sheets, morphometric analyses of pyroclastic cones, and the orientation and location of eruptive fissures. The study of eroded volcanoes enabled to assess the plumbing system geometry at deeper levels in the core of the edifice or underneath the volcano-substratum interface. Key sites are presented in extensional, transcurrent and contractional tectonic settings from North and South-America, Iceland, the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea and Africa. The types of sheet arrangements illustrated include swarms of parallel dykes, diverging rift patterns, centrally-inclined sheets, ring and radial dykes, circum-lateral collapse sheets, sills, and mixed members. This review shows that intrusive sheet emplacement at a volcano depends upon the combination of several local and regional factors, some of which are difficult to be constrained. While much progress has been made, it is still very challenging to forecast the likely paths and geometry of sheet propagation and emplacement during volcanic unrest events.Structure of volcano plumbing systems: A review of multi-parametric effects - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Antarctic volcanoes unmasked - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectEvidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectA zone of multiple sills localizes shear deformation at Piton des Neiges volcano.Evidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectSill magnetic fabric reveals cointrusive normal slip of the intrusion hanging wall.Evidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectThe sill zone acted as a sliding surface for a debris avalanche.Evidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectShear deformation, cointrusive sill slip and avalanche are directed toward the sea.Evidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectRepeated sill injections may increase volcano instability, leading to flank failure.Evidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectEvidence of sheared sills related to flank destabilization in a basaltic volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The September 14, 2015 phreatomagmatic eruption of Nakadake first crater, Aso Volcano, Japan: Eruption sequence inferred from ballistic, pyroclastic density current and fallout deposits - ScienceDirectThe September 14, 2015 phreatomagmatic eruption of Nakadake first crater, Aso Volcano, Japan: Eruption sequence inferred from ballistic, pyroclastic density current and fallout deposits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The September 14, 2015 phreatomagmatic eruption of Nakadake first crater, Aso Volcano, Japan: Eruption sequence inferred from ballistic, pyroclastic density current and fallout deposits - ScienceDirectPresent address: Nishikokubu Elementary School, 1972-1 Suwanomachi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0037, Japan.Volcanic gas emissions and degassing dynamics at Ubinas and Sabancaya volcanoes;

This wide back-arc lava plateau, with hundreds of monogenetic pyroclastic cones, covers a large area behind the active Andean volcanic arc. Here we focus on the northern Llancanelo volcanic field, particularly in Las Bombas volcano. Las Bombas volcano is an eroded, but still recognizable, scoria cone located in a circular depression surrounded by a basaltic lava flow, suggesting that Las Bombas volcano was there when the lava flow field formed and, therefore, the lava flow engulfed it completely. While this explanation seems reasonable, the common presence of similar landforms in this part of the field justifies the need to establish correctly the stratigraphic relationship between lava flow fields and these circular depressions. The main purpose of this research is to investigate Las Bombas volcano 3D subsurface architecture by means of geophysical methods. We carried out a paleomagnetic study and detailed topographic, magnetic and gravimetric land surveys. Magnetic anomalies of normal and reverse polarity and paleomagnetic results point to the occurrence of two different volcanic episodes. A circular low Bouguer anomaly was detected beneath Las Bombas scoria cone indicating the existence of a mass deficit. A 3D forward gravity model was constructed, which suggests that the mass deficit would be related to the presence of fracture zones below Las Bombas volcano cone, due to sudden degassing of younger magma beneath it, or to a single phreatomagmatic explosion.

Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-year-long thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system. This provides a remarkable support for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting, particularly in remote areas where permanent ground data acquisition is hazardous, expensive and difficult.Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectLong- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectNear- and far-field earthquakes can trigger the eruption of mud volcanoes.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectResponse of mud volcanoes to earthquakes can occur in the short- and long term.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectBoth static and dynamic stresses influence eruptions.Long- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectLong- and short-term triggering and modulation of mud volcano eruptions by earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Differences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectMaterial failure forecast method tested as means to predict volcanic eruption timeDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectApplied to precursory seismic energy for 2007 and 2014 eruptions of Kelud volcanoDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectFailed to provide useful predictions of eruption times for 2007 and 2014 eruptionsDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectRevealed differences in precursory energy release of effusive and Plinian eruptionsDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDifferences may reflect different processes before effusive and Plinian eruptions.Differences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDifferences of precursory seismic energy release for the 2007 effusive dome-forming and 2014 Plinian eruptions at Kelud volcano, Indonesia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectAutomatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectVolcano event durations are modeled in the HMM framework.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectState duration are modeling with max and min bounds.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectEvent duration are modeled with max and min bounds and with a gamma distribution.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectNew event penalization is incorporated to reduce false positives.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models - ScienceDirectIn this paper we propose an automatic volcano event detection system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with state and event duration models. Since different volcanic events have different durations, therefore the state and whole event durations learnt from the training data are enforced on the corresponding state and event duration models within the HMM. Seismic signals from the Llaima volcano are used to train the system. Two types of events are employed in this study, Long Period (LP) and Volcano-Tectonic (VT). Experiments show that the standard HMMs can detect the volcano events with high accuracy but generates false positives. The results presented in this paper show that the incorporation of duration modeling can lead to reductions in false positive rate in event detection as high as 31% with a true positive accuracy equal to 94%. Further evaluation of the false positives indicate that the false alarms generated by the system were mostly potential events based on the signal-to-noise ratio criteria recommended by a volcano expert.Automatic detection of volcano-seismic events by modeling state and event duration in hidden Markov models -

Synthetic tests indicate robustness and reliability of the results. Areas of high scattering attenuation coincide with the volcanic edifice and the summit at which recent eruptions took place. The intrinsic dissipation pattern shows a strong contrast between the east and west side of the volcanic structure with the low values observed in the west interpreted as solidified magma bodies.

An isogeny volcano is a connected component of a larger graph called a cordillera. In this paper, we further explore properties of how to compute volcanoes given that we have already computed one of a different degree. This allows us to compute volcanoes of composite degree more efficiently than a direct construction using modular polynomials.Computing isogeny volcanoes of composite degree - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Preliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectPreliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectWe report the data on a radon survey conducted at Villarrica volcano, Chile.Preliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectThese, with those of Galeras, are the sole measurements on South American volcanoes.Preliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectHigher emissions occur on the NNW sector of the cone: a zone of potential weakness.Preliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectThis research may contribute to improve volcano monitoring and surveillance.Preliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectPreliminary radon measurements at Villarrica volcano, Chile - ScienceDirectTo date, the Villarrica radon measurements reported here are, together with those collected at Galeras (Colombia), the sole radon data reported from South American volcanoes.

This question is particularly pertinent to hazard forecasting for dome-building volcanoes, where effusive activity may persist for years to decades, and may be punctuated by periods of repose, and sudden explosive activity. Here we review historical eruptive activity of fifteen lava dome-building volcanoes over the past two centuries, with the goal of creating a hierarchy of exchangeable (i.e., similar) behaviours. Eruptive behaviour is classified using empirical observations that include patterns of SO2 flux, eruption style, and magma composition. We identify two eruptive regimes: (i) an episodic regime where eruptions are much shorter than intervening periods of repose, and degassing is temporally correlated with lava effusion; and (ii) a persistent regime where eruptions are comparable in length to periods of repose and gas emissions do not correlate with eruption rates. A corollary to these two eruptive regimes is that there are also two different types of repose: (i) inter-eruptive repose separates episodic eruptions, and is characterised by negligible gas emissions and (ii) intra-eruptive repose is observed in persistently active volcanoes, and is characterised by continuous gas emissions. We suggest that these different patterns of can be used to infer vertical connectivity within mush-dominated magmatic systems. We also note that our recognition of two different types of repose raises questions about traditional definitions of historical volcanism as a point process. This is important, because the ontology of eruptive activity (that is, the definition of volcanic activity in time) influences both analysis of volcanic data and, by extension, interpretations of magmatic processes. Our analysis suggests that one identifying exchangeable traits or behaviours provides a starting point for developing robust ontologies of volcanic activity. Moreover, by linking eruptive regimes to conceptual models of magmatic processes, we illustrate a path towards developing a conceptual framework not only for comparing data between different volcanoes but also for improving forecasts of eruptive activity.Similarities and differences in the historical records of lava dome-building volcanoes: Implications for understanding magmatic processes and eruption forecasting - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe Lausche Hill is a polycyclic volcano of Lower Oligocene age.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe Lausche Volcano covers a pre-volcanic surface.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectSix Oligocene volcanoes of the Lausitz Mts. are preserved in their subaerial level.The polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectThe polycyclic Lausche Volcano (Lausitz Volcanic Field) and its message concerning landscape evolution in the Lausitz Mountains (northern Bohemian Massif, Central Europe) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Structural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectStructural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectRepeating seismic experiments reveal variation in seismic reflectivity beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan.Structural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectStructural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectSeismic reflectivity decreased by 30% with deflation after 2009.Structural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectChange in seismic velocity in the intermediate layer at the reflector can explain the reflectivity variation.Structural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectThe velocity change can be caused by temperature change through the progress of activity.Structural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectStructural evolution beneath Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, revealed through rounds of controlled seismic experiments - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano infrasound: A review - ScienceDirectExploding volcanoes, which produce intense infrasound, are reminiscent of the veritable explosion of volcano infrasound papers published during the last decade. Volcano infrasound is effective for tracking and quantifying eruptive phenomena because it corresponds to activity occurring near and around the volcanic vent, as opposed to seismic signals, which are generated by both surface and internal volcanic processes. As with seismology, infrasound can be recorded remotely, during inclement weather, or in the dark to provide a continuous record of a volcano's unrest. Moreover, it can also be exploited at regional or global distances, where seismic monitoring has limited efficacy. This paper provides a literature overview of the current state of the field and summarizes applications of infrasound as a tool for better understanding volcanic activity. Many infrasound studies have focused on integration with other geophysical data, including seismic, thermal, electromagnetic radiation, and gas spectroscopy and they have generally improved our understanding of eruption dynamics. Other work has incorporated infrasound into volcano surveillance to enhance capabilities for monitoring hazardous volcanoes and reducing risk. This paper aims to provide an overview of volcano airwave studies (from analog microbarometer to modern pressure transducer) and summarizes how infrasound is currently used to infer eruption dynamics. It also outlines the relative merits of local and regional infrasound surveillance, highlights differences between array and network sensor topologies, and concludes with mention of sensor technologies appropriate for volcano infrasound study.Volcano infrasound: A review - ScienceDirectVolcano infrasound: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation of the vertical distribution of Nabro volcano aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed by LIDAR - ScienceDirectVariation of the vertical distribution of Nabro volcano aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed by LIDAR - ScienceDirectThe volcanic aerosol layer in the stratosphere was observed using lidar.Variation of the vertical distribution of Nabro volcano aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed by LIDAR - ScienceDirectThe aerosol layer show different vertical profiles and optical properties with time.Variation of the vertical distribution of Nabro volcano aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed by LIDAR - ScienceDirectNon-spherical particle is more favorable to gravitational sedimentation.Variation of the vertical distribution of Nabro volcano aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed by LIDAR - ScienceDirectAn e-folding decay time of the layer is 117 days.Variation of the vertical distribution of Nabro volcano aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed by LIDAR - ScienceDirectFeature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectFeature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectA system for automatic recognition of Long Period events at Cotopaxi Volcano (Ecuador) is based on supervised learning.Feature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectThe feature extraction and selection of the relevant features allow identifying Long Period events.Feature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectThe analysis of the relevant features in the time, frequency, and scale domain allow detecting Long Period events.Feature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectThe optimal design for an automatic detection system of Long Period events has been based on classification techniques.Feature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectFeature selection of seismic waveforms for long period event detection at Cotopaxi Volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Glacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectGlacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectDuring Late Pleistocene the Nevado de Toluca volcano was ice-covered.Glacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe interaction between lava dome growth and glacier is reconstructed here.Glacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectA large amount of melting water was released forming thick fluvioglacial deposits.Glacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectIce-capped volcanoes are susceptible to lahar activity prior to an eruption.Glacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectGlacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageGlacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at ice-caped volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Magma sources in the mantle wedge beneath the volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group and Kizimen based on seismic tomography modeling - ScienceDirectThis study presents a 3D model of the P and S seismic velocities above the Kamchatkan slab obtained as a result of tomographic inversion of arrival times of body waves from deep seismicity in the subduction zone.

In the seismogenic zone at depths from 80 to 150 km, we observe a low-velocity anomaly, which probably reflects the presence of the relatively thick oceanic crust sinking together with the subducting slab. This anomaly may also represent a zone of phase transitions, melting, and release of fluids from the slab. In the cross sections, we observe vertical and inclined low-velocity anomalies connecting the slab with the volcanic groups that probably represent the paths of ascending fluids and melts, which feed the volcanoes. In the case of Kizimen, we observe a single conduit connecting the volcano with the slab transformation area at 100 km depth. Beneath the Klyuchevskoy group, we identify several linear inclined patterns having different dipping angles. This may show that the volcanoes of the group are fed from different segments of the slab and might be one of the reasons for the diversity of lava compositions in the volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group.Magma sources in the mantle wedge beneath the volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy group and Kizimen based on seismic tomography modeling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Structural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectStructural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectWe compared tectonic structures, volcanoes and magma paths in central Andes.Structural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectDifferent scenarios of magma-tectonic interaction explain complex magma path trends.Structural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectMagma tracked strike-slip faults or vertical strata oblique to principal stress axes.Structural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectMagma emplaced also at reverse faults and fold hinge normal to regional compression.Structural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectShallow magma paths are more sensitive to preexisting structures than regional stress.Structural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectStructural control on volcanoes and magma paths from local- to orogen-scale: The central Andes case - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectLong-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectGNSS and InSAR time series were jointly analyzed.Long-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectWe proposed an InSAR artifact correction method based on PCA.Long-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectWe provided precise time series maps describing ground displacement at PdF.Long-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectResults revealed a widespread seaward motion affecting the Eastern Flank of PdF.Long-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectWe discussed possible origins of the mobile flank motion.Long-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectLong-term ground displacement observations using InSAR and GNSS at Piton de la Fournaise volcano between 2009 and 2014 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirectUnderstanding the overall catalytic activity trend for rational catalyst design is one of the core goals in heterogeneous catalysis. In the past two decades, the development of density functional theory (DFT) and surface kinetics make it feasible to theoretically evaluate and predict the catalytic activity variation of catalysts within a descriptor-based framework. Thereinto, the concept of the volcano curve, which reveals the general activity trend, usually constitutes the basic foundation of catalyst screening. However, although it is a widely accepted concept in heterogeneous catalysis, its origin lacks a clear physical picture and definite interpretation. Herein, starting with a brief review of the development of the catalyst screening framework, we use a two-step kinetic model to refine and clarify the origin of the volcano curve with a full analytical analysis by integrating the surface kinetics and the results of first-principles calculations. It is mathematically demonstrated that the volcano curve is an essential property in catalysis, which results from the self-poisoning effect accompanying the catalytic adsorption process. Specifically, when adsorption is strong, it is the rapid decrease of surface free sites rather than the augmentation of energy barriers that inhibits the overall reaction rate and results in the volcano curve. Some interesting points and implications in assisting catalyst screening are also discussed based on the kinetic derivation. Moreover, recent applications of the volcano curve for catalyst design in two important photoelectrocatalytic processes (the hydrogen evolution reaction and dye-sensitized solar cells) are also briefly discussed.Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirectA self-consistent mathematic elucidation of the origin of volcano curve was conducted by a two-step kinetic model analytically, and some interesting guidelines for catalyst design are discussed during our derivation.Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Catalyst screening: Refinement of the origin of the volcano curve and its implication in heterogeneous catalysis - ScienceDirectHaifeng Wang(East China University of Science and Technology)received the Rising Star Award in 2014, which was presented by The Catalysis Society of China.

ScienceDirectChanges in temperatures in shallow geothermal systems beneath the Manza area in the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano region, Japan with time, were reconstructed by using chemical geothermometers derived from long-term data on the water chemistry of three typical hot springs in the area from almost the last fifty years. The calculated equilibrium temperatures for quartz, anhydrite and alunite were helpful in understanding the state of the hydrothermal systems in the area. Although the measured water temperatures of the hot springs at their vents have decreased gradually since the 1970s, the temperatures of the geothermal systems in the area do not seem to be in a downward trend based on the geothermometry. The temperatures of the geothermal systems have probably fluctuated in response to changes in the volcanic activity of the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. The changes in the estimated equilibrium temperatures for appropriate minerals give us helpful information on the volcanic activity that we can-not obtain directly, by monitoring of water chemistry of hot springs in the volcanic area.Chemical Geothermometry Studies on a Geothermal System in Manza Hot Springs Near Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano, Japan - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of WRI-15.Physical Properties and Mineral Content of Sidoarjo Mud Volcano - ScienceDirectLaboratory tests were conducted to assess the physical properties and mineral content of Sidoarjo mud volcano (or known as Lusi). These information are used to estimate the compression index which is considered to be important to support the reclamation program of the impoundment area. Physical properties of Lusi such as particle size distribution, Atterberg limits and specific gravity were determined in laboratory. Mineral content was observed through XRD test. Based on the Atterberg limit, the compression index was determined. The mineral content observed from the test are Chlorite and Illite. The results show that Lusi material consist of mostly fine-grained soil about 84.47% which dominated by clay size particle about 54.47% of total dry weight. Based on USCS it is classified as high plasticity silt (MH). New correlation has been proposed to estimate compression index from liquid limit and plasticity index using available data in literature. This new approach uses A-line in plasticity chart as boundary to database for developing the equations. Based on this separation of databases, more precise equations are obtained indicated by higher R value. Compression index of Lusi mud volcano is 0.367 from liquid limit-based calculation and is 0.454 from plasticity index-based calculation.Physical Properties and Mineral Content of Sidoarjo Mud Volcano - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of organizing committee of The 5th International Conference of Euro Asia Civil Engineering Forum (EACEF-5).Monogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectMonogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectMonogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater cluster confirmed by paleomagnetic dataMonogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectMonogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectMonogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectUbehebe Crater cluster is extinct, and not a continuing volcanic hazard.Monogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectMonogenetic origin of Ubehebe Crater maar volcano, Death Valley, California: Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence - ScienceDirectIt is also supported through a reinterpretation and recalculation of the published 10Be age results (Sasnett et al., 2012) from an innovative and bold exposure-age study on very young materials.

Further, the phenomena occurring on the surface of this volcano endow us with a remarkable perspective of recent martian geological changes. In the vicinity of this volcano cone, most of the lava is covered with a thick layer of loose sediments (probably clay). The presence of such sediments at the base of the volcano cone has led to the formation of several major landslides. Moreover, liquid water flow on the volcano cone has created a myriad of radial channels. The formation of such structures on the cone of a volcano is only plausible as a result of eruption of a mud volcano from its crater. Besides, the constant discharge of mud-like materials as well as hot water from the volcano paves the way for the growth and evolution of hydrothermal organisms.The role of mud volcanoes in the evolution of Hecate Tholus Volcano on the surface of Mars - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectCharacter of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectCulturally sensitive approaches to crisis response enhance local capacity and reduce vulnerabilty.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectSocial and cultural linkages are critical parts of crisis communication strategies.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectHazard mitigation relies on individuals' response to hazard information provided.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectSupporting regulation and a key role of local leaders is necessary in disaster education.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectCommunity preparedness works best when the local culture is considered in all activities.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectVolcano disaster mitigation is a priority in Indonesia's national development plan due to the large number of active volcanoes, high frequency of eruptions and dense population within volcanic hazards zones. As a consequence of these factors and the many decades of experience in mitigation of volcanic risk, Indonesia demonstrates that effective community response is critical to avoid disasters.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectUnderstanding of hazards, risks and early-warning systems are the main factors in building an effective community response. The level of understanding of these factors is proportional to a community's independence in taking appropriate actions and is reflected in the community's preparedness. Further, the experience gained from responses to the eruptions of Sinabung and Kelud as well as from other Indonesian volcanoes shows that a local leader plays an important role in mobilizing a community. Such a leader utilizes knowledge of local culture (local wisdom) and an understanding of the community's character to encourage community members to participate and empower themselves. Sharing of information and the formulation of a disaster mitigation plan by government and community also results in a shared commitment to increase participation and community empowerment.Character of community response to volcanic crises at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes - ScienceDirectIndonesia uses four volcano alert levels to activate community mitigation plans.

Investigation of the magmatic processes responsible for the eruption of the volcano and the conditions of the magma chamber is important in order to understand the volcanism of this system. Owing to their higher abundance and younger age, trachyandesitic rocks are the main components of this volcano. To get insights into the crystallization of these rocks, we carried out a quantitative and qualitative petrographic study of three main volcanic units erupted between 63 and 66.5 years ago. Crystal Size Distribution (CSD) studies can reveal details about magmatic processes. Measuring 4732 individual plagioclase crystals and conducting a CSD study, revealed a non-straight and concave-up CSD curve for nearly all of the studied volcanic units which suggests the occurrence of similar physico-chemical processes responsible for their magmatism. Plagioclase crystals occur as microlites and phenocrysts; the phenocrysts show either oscillatory zoning or sieve textures. Each segment of the CSD curves are consistent with a particular plagioclase texture in all the studied volcanic units. The presence of different plagioclase textures and the concave-up shape of the CSD curves suggests the variation of the physico-chemical conditions of the magma chamber during the magmatism of the Damavand in this time period. Mixing of magmas with different crystal populations can be an alternative for this phenomena.Quantitative textural investigation of trachyandesites of Damavand volcano (N Iran): Insights into the magmatic processes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigation of the Dashigil mud volcano (Azerbaijan) using beryllium-10 - ScienceDirectInvestigation of the Dashigil mud volcano (Azerbaijan) using beryllium-10 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Monitoring crustal changes at volcanoes by seismic noise interferometry: Mt.

Many remote sensing techniques have been applied to tracking anomalies and eruptive precursors, and monitoring ongoing volcanic eruptions, offering obvious advantages over in situ techniques especially during hazardous activity. Whilst spaceborne instruments provide a distinct advantage for collecting data remotely in this regard, they still cannot match the spatial detail or time resolution achievable using portable imagers on the ground or aircraft. Hand-held infrared camera technology has advanced significantly over the last decade, resulting in a proliferation of commercially available instruments, such that volcano observatories are increasingly implementing them in monitoring efforts. Improved thermal surveillance of active volcanoes has not only enhanced hazard assessment but it has contributed substantially to understanding a variety of volcanic processes. Drawing on over a decade of operational volcano surveillance in Italy, we provide here a critical review of the application of infrared thermal cameras to volcano monitoring. Following a summary of key physical principles, instrument capabilities, and the practicalities and methods of data collection, we discuss the types of information that can be retrieved from thermal imagery and what they have contributed to hazard assessment and risk management, and to physical volcanology. With continued developments in thermal imager technology and lower instrument costs, there will be increasing opportunity to gather valuable observations of volcanoes. It is thus timely to review the state of the art and we hope thereby to stimulate further research and innovation in this area.Volcano surveillance using infrared cameras - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcanotectonic evolution of central Jordan: Evidence from the Shihan Volcano -

ScienceDirectRheology of compressed ash depends on temperature, compression rate, and time.Rheology of basaltic ash from Stromboli volcano inferred from intermittent compression experiments - ScienceDirectMagnitude relation between characteristic time and set time is key for rheology.Rheology of basaltic ash from Stromboli volcano inferred from intermittent compression experiments - ScienceDirectAfter ash-dominated Strombolian eruption, considerable amount of ash falls back to the volcanic conduit. By the fallback ash, the formation of a dense near-surface region is expected because it is compacted by weights of its own and other fallback clasts. The dense cap causes the gas pressure inside the conduit to increase, which promotes a forthcoming eruption. Under such conditions, the rheology of the fallback ash plays an important role in this cyclical eruption mechanism. However, little attention has been given to the point. We examined the rheology of ash collected at Stromboli volcano via intermittent compression experiments changing temperature and compression time/rate. The elastic modulus, the viscosity, and the relaxation time were estimated by a viscoelastic Maxwell model. The results show that the elasticity and the viscosity dominantly depend on the compression rate and the temperature respectively, although both of them vary with time. Thus, the ash behaves either elastically or viscously depending on the external conditions and time. The viscoelastic characteristics can be explained by magnitude relationships between the characteristic relaxation time and times for compression and rest processes. This indicates that the balance of the time scales is key to determining the rheological characteristics.Rheology of basaltic ash from Stromboli volcano inferred from intermittent compression experiments - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Revised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectRevised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectTephra volumes are calculated from isopach data for Cascade Range eruptions.Revised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectVolumes are calculated using the models of Carey et al. (1995) and Sulpizio (2005).Revised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe models estimate the behavior of the distal isopachs.Revised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectPreferred volume estimates are provided based on a model for thickness versus distance.Revised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectIsopach maps from tephra eruptions from Mount St. Helens were reported in Carey et al. (1995) and for tephra eruptions from Glacier Peak in Gardner et al. (1998). For exponential thinning, the isopach data only define a single slope on a log thickness versus square root of area plot. Carey et al. (1995) proposed a model that was used to estimate a second slope, and volumes were presented in both studies using this model. A study by Sulpizio (2005) for estimating the second slope and square root of area where the lines intersect involves a systematic analysis of many eruptions to provide correlation equations. The purpose of this paper is to recalculate the volumes of Cascades eruptions and compare results from the two methods. In order to gain some perspective on the methods for estimating the second slope, we use data for thickness versus distance beyond the last isopach that are available for some of the larger eruptions in the Cascades. The thickness versus square root of area method is extended to thickness versus distance by developing an approximate relation between the two assuming elliptical isopachs with the source at one of the foci. Based on the comparisons made between the Carey et al. (1995) and Sulpizio (2005) methods, it is felt that the later method provides a better estimate of the second slope. For Mount St. Helens, the estimates of total volume using the Sulpizio (2005) method are generally smaller than those using the Carey et al. (1995) method. For the volume estimates of Carey et al. (1995), the volume of the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens is smaller than six of the eight previous eruptions. With the new volumes using the Sulpizio (2005) method, the 1980 eruption is smaller in volume than the upper end of the range for only three of the layers (Wn, Ye, and Yn) and is the same size as layer We. Thus the 1980 eruption becomes representative of the mid-range of volumes rather than being in the lower range.Revised tephra volumes for Cascade Range volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Principal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra - ScienceDirectPrincipal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra - ScienceDirectWe develop a benchmarking dataset for volcano seismic pattern recognition.Principal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra - ScienceDirectHierarchical clustering on SOM patterns does not reproduce the known input patterns.Principal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra - ScienceDirectHierarchical clustering applied to PCA results captures the known input patterns.Principal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra - ScienceDirectClustering on PCA results promising for automated pattern recognition in spectraPrincipal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra - ScienceDirectVariations in the spectral content of volcano seismicity related to changes in volcanic activity are commonly identified manually in spectrograms. However, long time series of monitoring data at volcano observatories require tools to facilitate automated and rapid processing. Techniques such as self-organizing maps (SOM) and principal component analysis (PCA) can help to quickly and automatically identify important patterns related to impending eruptions. For the first time, we evaluate the performance of SOM and PCA on synthetic volcano seismic spectra constructed from observations during two well-studied eruptions at Klauea Volcano, Hawai'i, that include features observed in many volcanic settings. In particular, our objective is to test which of the techniques can best retrieve a set of three spectral patterns that we used to compose a synthetic spectrogram. We find that, without a priori knowledge of the given set of patterns, neither SOM nor PCA can directly recover the spectra. We thus test hierarchical clustering, a commonly used method, to investigate whether clustering in the space of the principal components and on the SOM, respectively, can retrieve the known patterns. Our clustering method applied to the SOM fails to detect the correct number and shape of the known input spectra. In contrast, clustering of the data reconstructed by the first three PCA modes reproduces these patterns and their occurrence in time more consistently. This result suggests that PCA in combination with hierarchical clustering is a powerful practical tool for automated identification of characteristic patterns in volcano seismic spectra. Our results indicate that, in contrast to PCA, common clustering algorithms may not be ideal to group patterns on the SOM and that it is crucial to evaluate the performance of these tools on a control dataset prior to their application to real data.Principal component analysis vs. self-organizing maps combined with hierarchical clustering for pattern recognition in volcano seismic spectra -

ScienceDirectAn active continental margin, strongly disturbed later by intense volcanic activityFirst palynostratigraphical evidence for a Late Eocene to Early Miocene age of the volcano-sedimentary series of Dschang, western part of Cameroon and its implications for the interpretation of palaeoenvironment - ScienceDirectThe volcano-sedimentary infill of the Dschang basin in the Western part of Cameroon is poorly known. The present study provides the first biostratigraphical data of the volcano-sedimentary sequence and allows constraining the age and the position of this basin within the regional context of Central Africa. The studied sequence is composed of three depositional units. The first unit is a fining-upwards sequence of coarse-grained sandstone that gets finer towards the top, passing to thick layers of fossiliferous claystone. The second unit is strongly affected by volcanic activity and consists of a volcano-sedimentary sequence. The third unit is marked by basaltic volcanism and covers the series. Diverse and well-preserved palynomorphs were recovered and are used to provide valuable information for age determination of the Dschang volcano-sedimentary sequence, namely to be of late Eocene- Early Miocene age. The recovered spores, pollen, green algae and fungal remains from the bottom of the sequence include Bombacidites spp., Clavainaperturites cf. clavatus, Crototricolpites sp., Perfotricolpites digitatus, Proteacidites spp., Psilastephanocolporites minor, Psilastephanocolporites spp., Retitrescolpites spp., Retitricolporites irregularis, Retitricolporites spp., Retitriporites sp., Spirosyncolpites bruni (probably synonymous to Spirosyncolpites spiralis), Striatopollis bellus, (considered synonymous to Striatopollis catatumbus), Striatopollis sp., Tetracolporites quadratus, Tetratricolporites sp., ?Verrutricolporites rotundiporis, Cyathidites sp., Laevigatosporites spp., Polypodiaceoisporites spp., Verrucatosporites usmensis, Verrucatosporites spp., Botryococcus sp., Tasmanites sp., and fungal remains.First palynostratigraphical evidence for a Late Eocene to Early Miocene age of the volcano-sedimentary series of Dschang, western part of Cameroon and its implications for the interpretation of palaeoenvironment - ScienceDirectThe samples are assigned to the Verrucatosporites usmensis Zone of Salard-Cheboldaeff (1979).

Despite the all-weather capabilities of radar remote sensing and its high performance in monitoring of change, the contribution of radar data to operational monitoring activities has been limited in the past. This is largely due to: (1) the high costs associated with radar data; (2) traditionally slow data processing and delivery procedures; and (3) the limited temporal sampling provided by spaceborne radars. With this paper, we present new data processing and data integration techniques that mitigate some of these limitations and allow for a meaningful integration of radar data into operational volcano monitoring decision support systems. Specifically, we present fast data access procedures as well as new approaches to multi-track processing that improve near real-time data access and temporal sampling of volcanic systems with SAR data. We introduce phase-based (coherent) and amplitude-based (incoherent) change detection procedures that are able to extract dense time series of hazard information from these data. For a demonstration, we present an integration of our processing system with an operational volcano monitoring system that was developed for use by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). Through an application to a historic eruption, we show that the integration of SAR into systems such as AVO can significantly improve the ability of operational systems to detect eruptive precursors. Therefore, the developed technology is expected to improve operational hazard detection, alerting, and management capabilities.Integrating SAR and derived products into operational volcano monitoring and decision support systems -

The hanging wall of the Shanchiao Fault is the location of recent major volcanic activities. Low velocity zones in the southeast of Dayoukeng (DYK) may be interpreted as hydrothermal reservoirs or water-saturated Tertiary bedrock related to Cenozoic structures in the shallow crust. High velocities conspicuously dominate the east of the TVG, where the earliest stages of volcanism in the TVG are located, but where surface hydro-geothermal activities were absent in recent times. Between the Shanchiao Fault and Kanchiao Fault high velocities were detected, which converge below Mt. CS and may be related to early stages of magma conduits that gradually consolidated. These two faults may play a significant role with the TVG. The submarine volcanism adjacent to the Keelung coastline also requires further attention.Shallow crustal velocities and volcanism suggested from ambient noise studies using a dense broadband seismic network in the Tatun Volcano Group of Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow crustal velocities and volcanism suggested from ambient noise studies using a dense broadband seismic network in the Tatun Volcano Group of Taiwan - ScienceDirectWas at b and c affiliations between June 2012 and December 2014.Very-low-frequency resistivity, self-potential and ground temperature surveys on Taal volcano (Philippines): Implications for future activity - ScienceDirectVery-low-frequency resistivity, self-potential and ground temperature surveys on Taal volcano (Philippines): Implications for future activity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geoconservation and geotourism in Arxan-Chaihe Volcano Area, Inner Mongolia, China - ScienceDirectIn East Inner-Mongolia, the Arxan-Chaihe Volcano Area (ACVA) constitutes an important component part of the Cenozoic volcanic eruption area in Northeast China, with great scientific and aesthetic value. The area has received much attention since the 1980s. The Arxan National Geopark was established in 2004 and the Zalantun Autonomous Geopark in 2010, and volcanic geoconservation and geotourism developed to a certain degree, along with some common problems in geopark development. This paper analyzes the characteristics, geoconservation, and geotourism of volcanic geoheritage in the area. The main problems identified are the inefficient conservation management, uncoordinated development, and the limited interpretation system. We provide some suggestions on the problems in order to promote the local development, such as strengthening legislation, training tour guides as volcanologists with a background in geology who can interpret volcano geoheritage correctly, building a web site, and combining the two geoparks to apply for designation as a global geoparkGeoconservation and geotourism in Arxan-Chaihe Volcano Area, Inner Mongolia, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geothermal potential assessment of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano based on rock thermal conductivity measurements and numerical modeling of heat transfer - ScienceDirectGeothermal potential assessment of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano based on rock thermal conductivity measurements and numerical modeling of heat transfer - ScienceDirectA methodology to quantify geothermal potential is proposed.Geothermal potential assessment of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano based on rock thermal conductivity measurements and numerical modeling of heat transfer - ScienceDirectLaboratory thermal conductivity measurements on rock samples.Geothermal potential assessment of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano based on rock thermal conductivity measurements and numerical modeling of heat transfer - ScienceDirectCoupled groundwater flow and heat transfer modeling in geological porous media.Geothermal potential assessment of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano based on rock thermal conductivity measurements and numerical modeling of heat transfer - ScienceDirectExplosive eruptive history of Pantelleria, Italy: Repeated caldera collapse and ignimbrite emplacement at a peralkaline volcano - ScienceDirectExplosive eruptive history of Pantelleria, Italy: Repeated caldera collapse and ignimbrite emplacement at a peralkaline volcano - ScienceDirectExplosive eruptive history of Pantelleria, Italy: Repeated caldera collapse and ignimbrite emplacement at a peralkaline volcano - ScienceDirectSmall-scale background activity punctuated by 9 ignimbrite eruptionsExplosive eruptive history of Pantelleria, Italy: Repeated caldera collapse and ignimbrite emplacement at a peralkaline volcano - ScienceDirect5 caldera collapse events, 3 more than previously definedExplosive eruptive history of Pantelleria, Italy: Repeated caldera collapse and ignimbrite emplacement at a peralkaline volcano - ScienceDirectFuture large explosive eruptions cannot be ruled out.Explosive eruptive history of Pantelleria, Italy: Repeated caldera collapse and ignimbrite emplacement at a peralkaline volcano - ScienceDirectStaged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectStaged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectStaged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectDepth calculations from barometry correspond to existing seismic data.Staged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectPetrography and petrology indicate magma convection in the mid-to-shallow crust.Staged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectLong-lived crustal basalt reservoir maintains lava lakes via magma convection.Staged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectNew mineral-melt thermobarometry and mineral chemistry data are presented for basaltic scoriae erupted from the Mbwelesu crater of Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu, during persistent lava lake activity in 2005 and 2007. These data reveal crystallisation conditions and enable the first detailed attempt at reconstruction of the central magma plumbing system of Ambrym volcano. Pressures and temperatures of magma crystallisation at Ambrym are poorly constrained. This study focuses on characterising the magma conditions underlying the quasi-permanent lava lakes at the basaltic central vents, and examines petrological evidence for magma circulation.Staged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectStaged storage and magma convection at Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu - ScienceDirectResorption textures combined with effectively constant mafic mineral compositions suggest phenocryst convection in a storage region of consistent magma composition. In addition, basalt erupted at Ambrym has predominantly maintained a constant composition throughout the volcanic succession. This, coupled with recurrent periods of elevated central vent activity on the scale of months, suggest frequent magmatic recharge via steady-state melt generation at Ambrym.The October 16, 2013 rainfall-induced landslides and associated lahars at Izu Oshima Volcano, Japan -

ScienceDirectVolcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectDetailed geologic and structural map of Amiata VolcanoVolcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectVolcanic spreading occurs because the edifice sinks into shaley and anhydrite layers.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectVolcanic spreading formed summit grabens and basal uplift diapiric thrusts.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectBasal thrust structures are ideal heat-traps for geothermal energy accumulation.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectModelling shows that spreading could still be active.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectWe made a stratigraphic, structural and morphologic study of the Amiata Volcano in Italy. We find that the edifice is dissected by intersecting grabens that accommodate the collapse of the higher sectors of the volcano. In turn, a number of compressive structures and diapirs exist around the margin of the volcano. These structures create an angular drainage pattern, with stream damming and captures, and a set of lakes within and around the volcano. We interpret these structures as the result of volcanic spreading of Amiata on its weak substratum, formed by the late Triassic evaporites (Burano Anhydrites) and the Middle-Jurassic to Early-Cretaceous clayey chaotic complexes (Ligurian Complex). Regional doming created a slope in the basement facilitating the outward flow and spreading of the ductile layers forced by the volcanic load.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectWe model the dynamics of spreading with a scaled lubrication approximation of the Navier Stokes equations, and numerically study a set of solutions. In the model we include simple functions for volcanic deposition and surface erosion that change the topography over time. Scaling indicates that spreading at Amiata could still be active. The numerical solution shows that, as the central part of the edifice sinks into the weak basement, diapiric structures of the underlying formations form around the base of the volcano. Deposition of volcanic rocks within the volcano and surface erosion away from it both enhance spreading. In addition, a sloping basement may constitute a trigger for spreading and formation of trains of adjacent diapirs. As a feedback, the hot hydrothermal fluids decrease the shear strength of the anhydrites facilitating the spreading process.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectFinally, we observe that volcanic spreading has created ideal heat traps that constitute todays' exploited geothermal fields at Amiata. Normal faults generated by volcanic spreading, volcanic conduits, and direct contact between volcanic rocks (which host an extensive fresh-water aquifer) and the rocks of the geothermal field, constitute ideal pathways for water recharge during vapour extraction for geothermal energy production. We think that volcanic spreading could maintain faults in a critically stressed state, facilitating the occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity.Volcanic spreading forcing and feedback in geothermal reservoir development, Amiata Volcano, Italia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Carbonado-like diamond from the Avacha active volcano in Kamchatka, Russia - ScienceDirectCarbonado-like diamond from the Avacha active volcano in Kamchatka, Russia - ScienceDirectCarbonado-like diamonds identified in lavas of the active Avacha volcano.Carbonado-like diamond from the Avacha active volcano in Kamchatka, Russia - ScienceDirectCarbonado-like diamond from the Avacha active volcano in Kamchatka, Russia - ScienceDirectThe assemblage was formed via the mechanism of CVD.Carbonado-like diamond from the Avacha active volcano in Kamchatka, Russia - ScienceDirectCarbonado-like diamond from the Avacha active volcano in Kamchatka, Russia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Simulated Volcano Plot of Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Stepped Pt Surfaces - ScienceDirectSimulated Volcano Plot of Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Stepped Pt Surfaces - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectMud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectShallow underground electrical and seismic imaging was undertaken on a Mud Volcano.Mud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectThe hydrochemical properties of mineralized fluids were assessed.Mud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectReconstruction of the geometry of the shallow upward migration was obtained.Mud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectThe results can be used in areas where the morphological evidence is absent.Mud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectMud volcanoes are common geological phenomenons observed worldwide as in Italy.

Therefore, the understanding of their structure and hydrogeological circuits in the subsurface is an important key to define hazard and risk conditions in the adjacent areas.Mud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectMud volcanoes in central Italy: Subsoil characterization through a multidisciplinary approach - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectFirst detailed volcano-tectonic study of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province in LibyaVolcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirect432 lava shields and pyroclastic cones in the province cluster into two subzones.Volcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectStrike of 1000 (mostly normal) faults coincides with that of the volcanic fissures.Volcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectNumerical models suggest that some normal faults were used as parts of dyke paths.Volcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonics of the Al Haruj Volcanic Province, Central Libya - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mantle CO2 degassing at Mt.

Vulture volcano (Italy): Relationship between CO2 outgassing of volcanoes and the time of their last eruption - ScienceDirectThe new estimate of CO2 budget in the Mt.

This relation is also valid by using data from worldwide volcanoes highlighting that deep degassing can occur over very long time too.

However, variations in gas wetness can be ascribed to molecular fractionation during the gas rise. In contrast, the water shows seasonal variations in isotopic composition and surface evaporation is proposed as a mechanism to explain high water salinities in salsa lakes. By contrast, gryphons have geochemical signals suggesting a deep-seated water source.When mud volcanoes sleep: Insight from seep geochemistry at the Dashgil mud volcano, Azerbaijan - ScienceDirectThese results demonstrate that the plumbing system of dormant mud volcanoes is continuously recharged from deeper sedimentary reservoirs and that a branched system of conduits exists in the shallow subsurface. While the gas composition is consistently similar throughout the crater, the large assortment of water present reflects the type of seep (i.e. gryphons versus pools and salsa lakes) and their location within the volcano. Our data highlight the importance of a carefully planned sampling strategy when the target is water geochemistry, whereas the methane content and isotopic composition is relatively independent of the particular seep morphology.When mud volcanoes sleep: Insight from seep geochemistry at the Dashgil mud volcano, Azerbaijan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Longevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectLongevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectCrypto-tephra reveals a previously unrecognized record of volcanism.Longevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectLongevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectDramatic change in eruption style, volume and frequency in Auckland regionLongevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectHazard modeling needs to be revisited.Longevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectLongevity of a small shield volcano revealed by crypto-tephra studies (Rangitoto volcano, New Zealand): Change in eruptive behavior of a basaltic field - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The MU-RAY detector for muon radiography of volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe MU-RAY detector for muon radiography of volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Three-dimensional crustal movement and the activities of earthquakes, volcanoes and faults in Hainan Island, China - ScienceDirectThree-dimensional crustal movement and the activities of earthquakes, volcanoes and faults in Hainan Island, China - ScienceDirectYaxuan Hu, Senior engineer of Second Crust Monitoring and Application Center, China Earthquake Administration.

We describe the lithofacies association of these unusual volcaniclastic dykes, interpret the setting of dyke-forming fractures and the emplacement mechanism of internal deposits, and discuss their probable relationships with the explosive eruption and major lateral collapse events that occurred at the end of the Neostromboli period.Volcaniclastic dykes tell on fracturing, explosive eruption and lateral collapse at Stromboli volcano (Italy) - ScienceDirectThe dyke volcaniclastic deposits contain juvenile magmatic fragments (pyroclasts) suggesting a primary volcanic origin. Their petrographic characteristics are coincident with the Neostromboli products. The architecture of the infilling deposits comprises symmetrically-nested volcaniclastic units, separated by sub-vertical boundaries, which are parallel to the dyke margins. The volcanic units are composed of distinctive lithofacies. The more external facies is composed of fine and coarse ash showing sub-vertical laminations, parallel to the contact wall. The central facies comprises stratified, lithic-rich breccia and lapilli-tuff, whose stratification is sub-horizontal and convolute, discordant to the dyke margins. Only at Le Croci dyke, the final unit shows a massive tuff-breccia facies.Volcaniclastic dykes tell on fracturing, explosive eruption and lateral collapse at Stromboli volcano (Italy) - ScienceDirectThe volcaniclastic dykes experienced a polyphasic geological evolution comprising three stages. The first phase consisted in fracturing, explosive intrusion related to magma rising and upward injection of magmatic fluids and pyroclasts. The second phase recorded the dilation of fractures and their role as pyroclastic conduits in an explosive eruption possibly coeval with the lateral collapse of the Neostromboli lava cone. Finally, in the third phase, the immediately post-eruption mass-flow remobilization of pyroclastic deposits took place on the volcano slopes.Volcaniclastic dykes tell on fracturing, explosive eruption and lateral collapse at Stromboli volcano (Italy) -

ScienceDirectSignificant intercontinental volcanism can be observed in our reference model.Numerical modeling of deep oceanic slab dehydration: Implications for the possible origin of far field intra-continental volcanoes in northeastern China - ScienceDirectIntra-continental volcanoes have different origins compared to arc volcanoes, and several conflicting geodynamic mechanisms of intra-continental magmatism have been proposed, which require quantitative testing. In this paper, we investigate numerically possible influences of deep subducted slab dehydration processes for the development of intra-continental volcanoes distributed in northeastern China. We employ 2D thermo-mechanical numerical models to investigate the complex dynamics of long-term subduction process, including slab interaction with mantle transition zone, deep oceanic plate dehydration, trench rollback, and back-arc extension. Our experiments show systematically that water can be transported to the transition zone by stagnant slabs hydrating the overlaying deep asthenospheric mantle. Positively buoyant partially molten hydrous plumes arising from the hydrated area formed atop the slabs can propagate upwards and form partially molten mantle regions under the far field continental plate. Our numerical models thus suggest that the development of widely distributed intra-continental volcanism in northeastern China could be related to the rising of multiple relatively small hydrous plumes triggered by stagnant paleo-Pacific slab dehydration in the transition zone.Numerical modeling of deep oceanic slab dehydration: Implications for the possible origin of far field intra-continental volcanoes in northeastern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Linking geochemical processes in mud volcanoes with arsenic mobilization driven by organic matter - ScienceDirectLinking geochemical processes in mud volcanoes with arsenic mobilization driven by organic matter - ScienceDirectLinking geochemical processes in mud volcanoes with arsenic mobilization driven by organic matter - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectSeismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectWe perform double-difference earthquake relocation and body wave tomography.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectWe use a t* inversion method to obtain attenuation structure beneath the volcano.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectWe interpret a zone of low Vp and low Qp reaching to 6 km depth as a magma chamber.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectWe analyze migration of pre-eruptive earthquakes to investigate eruption triggers.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectHeterogeneous focal mechanisms of 2008 earthquakes suggest a complex stress regime.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectOkmok volcano is an active volcanic caldera located on the northeastern portion of Umnak Island in the Aleutian arc, with recent eruptions in 1997 and 2008. The Okmok area had ~900 locatable earthquakes between 2003 and June 2008, and an additional ~600 earthquakes from the beginning of the 2008 eruption to mid 2009, providing an adequate dataset for seismic tomography. To image the seismic velocity structure of Okmok, we apply waveform cross-correlation using bispectrum verification and double-difference tomography to a subset of these earthquakes. We also perform P-wave attenuation tomography using a spectral decay technique. We examine the spatio-temporal characteristics of seismicity in the opening sequence of the 2008 eruption to investigate the path of magma migration during the establishment of a new eruptive vent. We also incorporate the new earthquake relocations and three-dimensional (3D) velocity model with first-motion polarities to compute focal mechanisms for selected events in the 2008 pre-eruptive and eruptive periods.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectSeismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectSeismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectPresent address: Spectraseis Inc., 1899, Wynkoop Street, Suite 350, Denver CO 80202.Seismicity and seismic structure at Okmok Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectDeformations and slope instability on Stromboli volcano: Integration of GBInSAR data and analog modeling - ScienceDirectDeformations and slope instability on Stromboli volcano: Integration of GBInSAR data and analog modeling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geological and geotechnical characterization of the debris avalanche and pyroclastic deposits of Cotopaxi Volcano (Ecuador).

Structural, morphological, geodetic and geophysical evidence supports the continuous deformation of their flanks. While identification of instability has been recognized in well-documented examples, until recently the initial stages of such processes have been difficult to capture. Using a combination of geological, geodetic and geophysical data analysis, we study the stability of the Cumbre Vieja. New descending radar interferometric data, covering a volcanologically quiet period between 1992 and 2008 at Cumbre Vieja, indicate movement away from the satellite on the western volcano flank. Using an inversion of stacked velocity maps, we determine the geometry and slip for a near-horizontal dislocation beneath the western flank of Cumbre Vieja. Our ground deformation modelling results (position and depth) are in agreement with a low-density anomaly constrained by gravity data. The previously undetected intereruptive ground deformation at Cumbre Vieja volcano flanks was explained as an indicator of a kinematic passive response model of the flank, where the flanks were mobilized only during periods of magmatic activity (shallow dike intrusions) and remained stable and undeformed during intereruptive periods. Here, we present new results indicating that active creeping stress release due to gravitational loading is also a dominant deformation mechanism for (current) intereruptive periods at Cumbre Vieja, which would contribute positively to the stabilization of the edifice and reduce the associated hazard related to the volcano flank dynamics. This study at Cumbre Vieja can be considered as a prototype for similar volcanoes around the Macaronesian islands group (e.g., Fogo, Teide, El Hierro, Pico) and elsewhere.Shallow flank deformation at Cumbre Vieja volcano (Canary Islands): Implications on the stability of steep-sided volcano flanks at oceanic islands - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Platinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectPlatinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectPrimitive arc basalt magma represents the 1941 eruption of Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka.Platinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectPlatinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectSulfide melt inclusions are highly variable in Ni/Cu and PGE, Ag, Te, Au, Pb and Bi.Platinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectPlatinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectTolbachik sulfide melts are compositionally similar to sulfides in magmatic deposits.Platinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectPlatinum-group elements and gold in sulfide melts from modern arc basalt (Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Strongly gliding harmonic tremor during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectStrongly gliding harmonic tremor during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectStrongly gliding harmonic tremor during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Transtension driving volcano-edifice anatomy: Insights from Andean transverse-to-the-orogen tectonic domains - ScienceDirectTranstension driving volcano-edifice anatomy: Insights from Andean transverse-to-the-orogen tectonic domains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Continental margin large-scale instability controlling the flank sliding of Etna volcano - ScienceDirectEtna volcano is affected by a downward sliding of its eastern flank, as rapid as a few cm/year, whose nature is highly debated. Recently collected marine geological and geophysical data allows a detailed image of the morphostructural setting of the continental margin facing the volcano. Here, a large bulge offsets the margin that is deeply affected by widespread semicircular steps, interpreted as evidence of large-scale gravitational instability. Such features permeate the whole margin and extend inshore to the volcano sector where the larger ground deformations are measured. Both submarine instability and subaerial flank sliding are bounded by two regional tectonic lineaments interpreted as weakness lines. These cross the coastline to accommodate the basinward movement of this large sector of the continental margin topped by the Etna volcanic pile. The new data allows re-interpreting the tectonic setting of the coastal belt and proposing a novel structural model, highlighting the active role of the continental margin instability to drive the seaward sliding of the volcano's eastern flank. This model may suggest why a very active basaltic volcano has so unusually developed in front of an active thrust belt.Continental margin large-scale instability controlling the flank sliding of Etna volcano - ScienceDirectContinental margin large-scale instability controlling the flank sliding of Etna volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Soil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectSoil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectSoil CO2 flux is measured in the Tatun Volcano Group, Taiwan.Soil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe flux spatial distribution is related to degassing pattern.Soil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectSoil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectHelium and carbon isotopes of soil gas reveal shallow degassing features.Soil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectSoil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Soil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan - ScienceDirectDeceased.Simulation of nonisothermal metasomatism of peridotite from mantle wedge beneath the Avacha group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectComprehensive studies of mineralogy, fluid and melt inclusions, and gas phase in minerals from a representative collection of peridotite xenoliths that underwent metasomatism and convective partial melting in the mantle wedge beneath Avacha Volcano were used to simulate interactions between mantle wedge material and magmatic fluids of constant and variable compositions at different depths, as well as metasomatic effects of fluids derived from subduction slabs. The obtained virtual dynamic patterns of metasomatic zoning across the mantle wedge show how composition variations of fluids and PT conditions at their sources influence the facies of metasomatized mantle wedge harzburgite. The compositions of the Avacha xenoliths and crustal rodingite from Kamchatka compared with results of physicochemical modeling suggest that eruptions of Avacha Volcano brought metasomatized material of the upper mantle wedge to the surface. The rocks underwent multistage metasomatism along cracks in a relatively narrow temperature range. Such processes are apparently common to seismically deformed permeable lithosphere above magma reservoirs. However, the mineralogical zoning of the Kamchatka crustal rhodingites differs from that in cracked metasomatic peridotite above the sources of magmatic fluids in the mantle wedge beneath the Kamchatka arc.Simulation of nonisothermal metasomatism of peridotite from mantle wedge beneath the Avacha group of volcanoes (Kamchatka) -

ScienceDirectThis paper discusses the origin of gas seepages (free gas or dissolved gas in ground water or brine) sampled with the Nautile submarine during the Nautinil cruise at the seafloor of the deep water area of the Nile turbiditic system on different mud volcanoes and brine pools. Generally, the gas is wet and includes C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4, CO2. These gas samples show no evidence of biodegradation which is not the case of the gas present in the deep hydrocarbon accumulations at depth. It indicates that the gas expelled by the mud volcanoes is not issued from direct leakages from deep gas fields. The collected gas samples mainly have a thermogenic origin and show different maturities. Some samples show very high maturities indicating that these seepages are sourced from great depths, below the Messinian salt. Moreover, the different chemical compositions of the gas samples reflect not only differences in maturity but also the fact that the gas finds its origin in different deep source rocks. Carbon dioxide has an organic signature and cannot result from carbonate decomposition or mantle fluids. The crustal-derived radiogenic isotopes show that the analyzed gas samples have suffered a fractionation processes after the production of the radiogenic isotopes, due either to oil occurrence at depth interacting with the flux of gas, and/or fractionation during the fluid migration.Origins of hydrocarbon gas seeping out from offshore mud volcanoes in the Nile delta - ScienceDirectOrigins of hydrocarbon gas seeping out from offshore mud volcanoes in the Nile delta - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectA geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectk-means clustering has been applied to a trivariate dataset concerning the most active area of the Campi Flegrei caldera.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectThe multivariate set consists of resistivity, P-wave velocity and density parameters, extracted from univariate sections.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectAs findings of the k-means analysis, six compact and separated clusters have been identified.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectA linear regression allowed two classes of clusters to be recognized each class has been represented in the joint parameter space by a planar equation.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectPeculiar combinations among the analyzed parameters has been defined through this equation and its partial derivatives.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectA geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectBased on drilling and stratigraphy data and recent seismic activity, the interface has been interpreted in terms of a change in the rocks rheology in such a way, the brittle-to-ductile transition inside the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system has been retrieved.A geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectA geophysical k-means cluster analysis of the Solfatara-Pisciarelli volcano-geothermal system, Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Development and spatial distribution of soils on an active volcano: Mt Etna, Sicily - ScienceDirectDevelopment and spatial distribution of soils on an active volcano: Mt Etna, Sicily - ScienceDirectAs an active volcano, Mt Etna presents complex environments for soil formation.Development and spatial distribution of soils on an active volcano: Mt Etna, Sicily - ScienceDirectSoils of chronosequence of lava flows analysed;

For this reason, characterization of volcano distribution at a global scale can be used to obtain insights concerning dynamic aspects of planetary interiors. Until present, studies of this type commonly have focused on volcanic features of a specific type (e.g., large volcanoes in Venus or hot-spot volcanism on Earth), or have concentrated on relatively small regions (i.e., vent distribution within individual volcanic fields), but no comparison of extensive databases has been made by using the same tools in both planets. In this work, the description of the distribution of volcanic features observed over the entire surface of Venus is made using the same tool used for Earth, and is applied to an extensive database. The analysis is based on density contours obtained with the Fisher kernel. As a result, several groupings of volcanoes are identified refining the already documented concentration of volcanoes on the BAT zone. In particular some doughnut-like patterns are observed that might be related to the action of mantle plumes. The occurrence of such features on Earth, as well as the existence of a uniform distribution of background volcanism on both planets, suggests similarities on their geodynamic behavior that had not been identified previously.Insights into the dynamics of planetary interiors obtained through the study of global distribution of volcanoes II: Tectonic implications from Venus -

ScienceDirectMS remains to be a challenge for researchers and neurologists across globe.Multiple sclerosis in India: Iceberg or volcano - ScienceDirectMultiple sclerosis (MS)1 is a chronic neurodegenerative disease involving destruction of the myelin sheath around axons of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. There has been a tremendous transformation in its perspective across globe. In recent years, its prevalence has changed dramatically worldwide and India is no exception. Initially, MS was believed to be more common in the Caucasians of Northern Europe and United States; however, it has been found to be present in Indian subcontinent as well. There has been a considerable shift in MS prevalence in India and this has really changed the notion of considering India as a low risk zone for MS. In this review, a concise overview and latest update on changing scenario of MS in India is presented along with some major challenges regarding it persisting across globe even today. In India, remarkable upsurge is needed in carrying out large scale population-based epidemiological studies to get an idea about the true incidence and prevalence rates of MS viz a viz disease burden. Through this review, we have probably tried to identify the actual picture of MS prevalence in India and this could serve as harbinger for upcoming research and at the same time it would definitely aid in working out future strategies for MS management in the country.Multiple sclerosis in India: Iceberg or volcano - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (70KB)Download full-size imageMultiple sclerosis in India: Iceberg or volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multiple sclerosis in India: Iceberg or volcano - ScienceDirectAbbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; CS, clinically definite; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSIF, Multiple Sclerosis International Federation; WHO, World Health Organization.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectSystematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectAtmospheric uncertainties for InSAR are estimated a priori using atmospheric models.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectUncertainties are dependent on volcano topography and geographical location.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectDetection thresholds are calculated for InSAR monitoring of Cascade volcanoes.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectPre-eruptive unrest is most likely to be observed at low relief, shield volcanoes.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectThis approach is widely applicable for near-real-time monitoring on arc-wide scales.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectSatellite Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is suited to monitoring ground deformation on the scale of volcanic arcs, providing insight into the eruptive cycle over both long and short time periods. However, these measurements are often contaminated with atmospheric artefacts caused by changes in the refractivity of the atmosphere. Here, we test the use of two large-scale atmospheric models, ERA-Interim (ERA-I) and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), to correct atmospheric uncertainties in InSAR data from the Cascades Volcanic Arc, United States. At Lassen Volcanic Center, we find that NARR reduces interferogram standard deviation in 79% of cases by an average of 22%.Systematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectSystematic assessment of atmospheric uncertainties for InSAR data at volcanic arcs using large-scale atmospheric models: Application to the Cascade volcanoes, United States - ScienceDirectCOMET (Centre for the Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, volcanoes and Tectonics).Pyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectPyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectWe present new augite and enstatite standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis (82).Pyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectPyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectPyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectPyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (97KB)Download full-size imagePyroxene standards for SIMS oxygen isotope analysis and their application to Merapi volcano, Sunda arc, Indonesia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rapid changes in magma storage beneath the Klyuchevskoy group of volcanoes inferred from time-dependent seismic tomography - ScienceDirectRapid changes in magma storage beneath the Klyuchevskoy group of volcanoes inferred from time-dependent seismic tomography - ScienceDirectRapid changes in magma storage beneath the Klyuchevskoy group of volcanoes inferred from time-dependent seismic tomography - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The 2013 eruption of Chaparrastique volcano (El Salvador): Effects of magma storage, mixing, and decompression - ScienceDirectThe 2013 eruption of Chaparrastique volcano (El Salvador): Effects of magma storage, mixing, and decompression - ScienceDirectThe 2013 eruption of Chaparrastique volcano (El Salvador): Effects of magma storage, mixing, and decompression - ScienceDirectMajor and trace element modelling excludes fractional crystallization as the primary mechanism controlling the bulk rock variability, whereas geochemical data align along a mixing trend between two end-members representative of the primitive basalt and the differentiated basaltic andesite. Trace element and isotope data indicate that the primary source of magmatism is an enriched MORB-like mantle with the contribution of fluxes of metasomatic fluids and/or melts produced by the subducted slab. The role played by slab-fluid inputs of carbonate origin and slab-melts from the hemipelagic sediments seems to be minimal. Assimilation/contamination processes of magmas by crustal rocks are also negligible. In contrast, the geochemical signature of magmas is greatly influenced by slab-derived aqueous fluids produced prevalently by progressive dehydration of marine sediments and altered basaltic crust.The 2013 eruption of Chaparrastique volcano (El Salvador): Effects of magma storage, mixing, and decompression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Forced transport of thermal energy in magmatic and phreatomagmatic large volume ignimbrites: Paleomagnetic evidence from the Colli Albani volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectForced transport of thermal energy in magmatic and phreatomagmatic large volume ignimbrites: Paleomagnetic evidence from the Colli Albani volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectLarge-volume ignimbrites are dominated by the mass flux.Forced transport of thermal energy in magmatic and phreatomagmatic large volume ignimbrites: Paleomagnetic evidence from the Colli Albani volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectPyroclastic flows are thermodynamically isolated for several tens of kilometers.Forced transport of thermal energy in magmatic and phreatomagmatic large volume ignimbrites: Paleomagnetic evidence from the Colli Albani volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectPhreatomagmatism affects emplacement temperature even in large-volume eruptions.Forced transport of thermal energy in magmatic and phreatomagmatic large volume ignimbrites: Paleomagnetic evidence from the Colli Albani volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectForced transport of thermal energy in magmatic and phreatomagmatic large volume ignimbrites: Paleomagnetic evidence from the Colli Albani volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.River responses to the 2010 major eruption of the Merapi volcano, central Java, Indonesia - ScienceDirectThis study examines the fluvial readjustment of a Javanese river impacted by the major eruption of the Merapi volcano (Indonesia) in October and November 2010. The basin of the Opak River, located on the southern flank of the Merapi, was subject to substantial sediment input related to massive pyroclastic deposits that were remobilized by numerous lahars during the year after the eruption. Two study sites were equipped in order to evaluate the morphodynamic evolution of the riverbed of the Opak River. Topographic surveys, bedload particle marking, and suspended sediment sampling revealed an important sediment mobilization during efficient flash floods. Surprisingly, no bed aggradation related to the progradation of a sediment wave was observed. Two years after the eruptive event, marked bed incision was observed. The Opak River readjustment differs from that of other fluvial systems affected by massive eruptions in two ways. Firstly, local population extracted the sand and blocks injected by the eruption as they represent a valuable economic resource. Secondly, several dams trapped the major part of the sediment load remobilized by lahars.River responses to the 2010 major eruption of the Merapi volcano, central Java, Indonesia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano-tectonic deformation in the Kivu Region, Central Africa: Results from six years of continuous GNSS observations of the Kivu Geodetic Network (KivuGNet) - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic deformation in the Kivu Region, Central Africa: Results from six years of continuous GNSS observations of the Kivu Geodetic Network (KivuGNet) - ScienceDirectA continuous GNSS network of 15 stations is operating in the Kivu Region.Volcano-tectonic deformation in the Kivu Region, Central Africa: Results from six years of continuous GNSS observations of the Kivu Geodetic Network (KivuGNet) - ScienceDirectWe record both inter-eruptive and co-eruptive deformation from Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo.Volcano-tectonic deformation in the Kivu Region, Central Africa: Results from six years of continuous GNSS observations of the Kivu Geodetic Network (KivuGNet) - ScienceDirectCurrent deformation indicates ongoing magma accumulation at Nyamulagira-Nyiragongo.Volcano-tectonic deformation in the Kivu Region, Central Africa: Results from six years of continuous GNSS observations of the Kivu Geodetic Network (KivuGNet) - ScienceDirectVolcano-tectonic deformation in the Kivu Region, Central Africa: Results from six years of continuous GNSS observations of the Kivu Geodetic Network (KivuGNet) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectThe eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectFirst detailed account of the eruptive history of Aluto volcanoThe eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectThe eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectThe eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectPost-caldera eruptions dominated by highly-evolved peralkaline rhyolitesThe eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectThe eruptive history and magmatic evolution of Aluto volcano: new insights into silicic peralkaline volcanism in the Ethiopian rift - ScienceDirectGeophysical and geochemical methods applied to investigate fissure-related hydrothermal systems on the summit area of Mt.

ScienceDirectOvariectomy influences the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity and the photic phase shifts in the volcano mouse - ScienceDirectRecently, the relationship between the circadian system and female reproduction has been of great interest; ovarian hormones can modify the amount and distribution of daily activity differently in rodent species. The volcano mouse Neotomodon alstoni is a species in which it is possible to study the circadian rhythm of locomotion, and it offers comparative information about the influence of ovaries on the circadian system. In this study, we used infrared crossings to compare free movement in intact and sham-operated or ovariectomized mice. We analyzed behavioral and endocrine changes related to the estrous cycle and locomotor circadian rhythm in free-running mice and photic phase shifting. Evidence shows that intact mice present a scalloped pattern of daily activity during the estrous cycle. In constant darkness, the ovariectomy reduces the total amount of activity, shortens the free-running circadian period of locomotion and increases photic phase shifts during the early subjective night. During entrainment, the ovariectomized mice increased the amplitude of total activity during the scotophase, and delay the time of activity onset. These results suggest that ovarian hormones in N. alstoni modulate the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in a species-specific manner.Ovariectomy influences the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity and the photic phase shifts in the volcano mouse - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Metal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectMetal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectSoils from Greenstone Belts (GB) are enriched in Cr and Ni.Metal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectMetal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectA new geochemical index, the Fe-independent accumulation factor (Af-Fe), is introduced.Metal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectMore than 90% of the metal dynamic in GB soils is associated to Fe enrichment.Metal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectMetal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (282KB)Download full-size imageMetal accumulation in soils derived from volcano-sedimentary rocks, Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt, northeastern Brazil - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcano's screams may explain eruption's awesome power - ScienceDirectVolcano's screams may explain eruption's awesome power - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Three-armed rifts or masked radial pattern of eruptive fissures?

The mud volcano, known as LUSI, began erupting near the Banjarpanji-1 exploration well in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia. LUSI offers a unique opportunity to study the genesis and development of a mud volcano.The LUSI mud volcano triggering controversy: Was it caused by drilling? - ScienceDirectFor the first time, this paper presents all raw and interpreted drilling data, so any interested party can perform their own assessment. Our study suggests that LUSI mud volcano was a naturally occurring mud volcano in an area prone for its mud volcanism. Pressure analysis done on the Banjarpanji well shows that the pressure exerted at the well is lower than the fracture pressure at the last casing shoe, and suggests that the well was intact and did not suffer an underground blowout. This is further supported by evidence and observation made during drilling (such as circulation was done on an open BOP) and subsequent relief wells (Sonan and temperature log runs).The LUSI mud volcano triggering controversy: Was it caused by drilling? - ScienceDirectThis study offers a different alternative to earlier hypothesis that events at the Banjarpanji well were the trigger for the LUSI mud volcano. More work is needed by the scientific community to study the sequence of events in order to explain and clarify the real trigger of LUSI.The LUSI mud volcano triggering controversy: Was it caused by drilling? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Trace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectTrace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectThe highest temperature gases sampled directly for trace elements.Trace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectTrace element pattern was studied for the rift/plume volcano emissions.Trace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectConcentrations and fluxes of 67 metals and metalloids in gases were quantified.Trace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectGaseous and aerosol modes of trace element transport were resolved.Trace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectTrace elements in the gas emissions from the Erta Ale volcano, Afar, Ethiopia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Deep long-period earthquakes beneath Washington and Oregon volcanoes - ScienceDirectDeep long-period earthquakes beneath Washington and Oregon volcanoes - ScienceDirectDeep long-period earthquakes beneath Washington and Oregon volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Deep long-period earthquakes beneath Washington and Oregon volcanoes - ScienceDirectPermanent address: 3221 W.

After the eruption and heavy rain, the volcanic activity subsided to calm period, crater bottom was refilled with water, and water level increased in the Nakadake crater. The next tremor reappeared in 2014 and tracked to eruption in November 2014. This eruptive pattern and water level variation in the crater repeatedly appeared on the surface, and it should be related to the hydrothermal dynamics beneath Aso volcano.The oscillation model of hydrothermal dynamics beneath Aso volcano, southwest Japan after small eruption on May 2011: A new understanding model using repeated absolute and relative gravity measurement -

ScienceDirectAccurately delimiting boundaries is required for characterizing landforms through measurement of their geomorphometric parameters. Volcanism produces a wide range of landforms, from symmetric cones to very irregular massifs, that can gradually merge with the surroundings and contain other elements, thus complicating landform delimitation. Most morphometric studies of volcanoes delimit landforms manually, with the inconvenience of being time-consuming and subjective. Here we propose an algorithm, NETVOLC, for automatic volcano landform delimitation based on the premise that edifices are bounded by concave breaks in slope. NETVOLC applies minimum cost flow (MCF) networks for computing the best possible edifice outline using a DEM and its first- and second-order derivatives. The main cost function considers only profile convexity and aspect; three alternative functions (useful in complex cases) also consider slope, elevation and/or radial distance. NETVOLC performance is tested by processing the Mauna Kea pyroclastic cone field. Results using the main cost function compare favorably to manually delineated outlines in 2/3rds of cases, whereas for the remaining 1/3rd of cases an alternative cost function is needed, introducing some degree of subjectivity. Our algorithm provides a flexible, objective and time-saving tool for automatically delineating volcanic edifices. Furthermore, it could be used for delineating other landforms with concave breaks in slope boundaries. Finally, straightforward modifications can be implemented to extend the algorithm capabilities for delimiting landforms bounded by convex breaks in slope, such as summit craters and calderas.NETVOLC: An algorithm for automatic delimitation of volcano edifice boundaries using DEMs - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectFast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectDecomposition of the seismic wavefield into basic components by Independent Component AnalysisFast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectImprovement of the location procedure and polarization analysisFast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectContribution to source/propagation studiesFast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectUseful tool for volcano monitoring practiceFast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectIn the present work a new approach for the analysis of polarization of seismic signals is proposed. The method is based on Independent Component Analysis and allows the identification and separation of the basic sources, which are naturally polarized into the vertical and horizontal planes. The results from the case study of a swarm of volcano-tectonic earthquakes occurred at Campi Flegrei in October 2015 are impressive: a clear separation of the P- and S-wave seismic phases in the time domain is obtained. In addition, the efficiency of the method in retrieving the polarization parameters is demonstrated by the comparison with other standard techniques. The presented approach provides wavefield decomposition and polarization analysis in a single step, thus avoiding a priori cumbersome filtering procedures and segmentation of the signals. It is useful for discriminating and analysing different seismic phases and can be applied to a variety of volcanic and tectonic signals, therefore it can strongly support all the studies on propagation and source mechanism. Moreover, due to its fastness and robustness this stand-alone tool can be routinely used in the volcano monitoring practice.Fast wavefield decomposition of volcano-tectonic earthquakes into polarized P and S waves by Independent Component Analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.First determination of magma-derived gas emissions from Bromo volcano, eastern Java (Indonesia) - ScienceDirectFirst determination of magma-derived gas emissions from Bromo volcano, eastern Java (Indonesia) - ScienceDirectGas emissions from Bromo volcano in Indonesia are characterised for the first time.First determination of magma-derived gas emissions from Bromo volcano, eastern Java (Indonesia) - ScienceDirectBromo is one of the strongest and persistent sources of volcanic gas in Indonesia.First determination of magma-derived gas emissions from Bromo volcano, eastern Java (Indonesia) - ScienceDirectThe magmatic gas CO2/sulphur signature of Java volcanism is constrained at 3 to 4.First determination of magma-derived gas emissions from Bromo volcano, eastern Java (Indonesia) - ScienceDirectFirst determination of magma-derived gas emissions from Bromo volcano, eastern Java (Indonesia) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The volcano that hides ice like Mars - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Clinopyroxene-melt element partitioning during interaction between trachybasaltic magma and siliceous crust: Clues from quartzite enclaves at Mt.

Numerous microbially controlled sediment-surface morphologies are evident, such as flat cohesive mats that commonly pass into mats with wrinkles, reticulates, and tufts, together with erosion pockets and mat chips. These microbial mats form cohesive surface layers that lead to biostabilization of the sediment surface. Fluidization of the underlying sediments is due to tidal influences and pressurized gas escape from decay and photosynthesis of microbial mats and causes deformation and rupture of the cohesive surface mat layer via vertical and sub-vertical pipes. Extrusion of fluidized sediments and water through these pipes leads to redeposition of sediment grains above the surface mat layer to form sand volcanoes and mounds. Most of the sand volcanoes present in the intertidal flats and supratidal pools show a symmetrical morphology, whereas in tidal channels asymmetrical forms are more common. Extrusion of underlying sediments through several adjacent vents leads to coalescence of sand volcanoes to form sand mounds. In this study sand volcanoes are also compared with other cone-like features from the Red Sea, such as gas domes and crab mounds. This comparison should help in differentiating similar cone-like features associated with microbial mats in the rock record.The influence of microbial mats on the formation of sand volcanoes and mounds in the Red Sea coastal plain, south Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Temporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectTemporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectTemporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectPost-caldera lavas are geochemically distinct from older lavas.Temporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectEvidences of short-term changes in the mantle sourceTemporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectInvolvement of different metasomatic agents and variable degrees of partial meltingTemporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectPyroclastic Series eruption triggered caldera collapse and gave access to new magma.Temporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectTemporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectTemporal magma source changes at Gaua volcano, Vanuatu island arc - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Monitoring volcanoes using seismic noise correlations - ScienceDirectMonitoring volcanoes using seismic noise correlations - ScienceDirectMonitoring volcanoes using seismic noise correlations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectHydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectTwo years of seismicity data were collected on a mid-ocean ridge central volcano.Hydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectSeismicity marks the bottom of along-axis hydrothermal cells feeding the volcano's vent field.Hydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectThe cells tap heat from an axial magma chamber (AMC), whose shape helps to organize the flow.Hydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectHydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectHydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo, Norway.Hydrothermal seismicity beneath the summit of Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge - ScienceDirectThe effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on digestion and mortality in the volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) - ScienceDirectThe effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on digestion and mortality in the volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pluto ice volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Chapter 13 Seismic Wave Scattering in Volcanoes - ScienceDirectChapter 13 Seismic Wave Scattering in Volcanoes - ScienceDirectAt high frequencies, diffusion approximation is appropriate to describe the energy seismogram envelope.

The aim of this study is to investigate its tectonic evolution through a detailed structural analysis based on remote sensing and field data. The structural and aerogeophysics data indicate that at least three major deformational events affected the basin. Event E1 caused the activation of the two main basin-bounding fault zones, the Guaratubinha Master Fault and the Guaricana Shear Zone. These structures, oriented N20-45E, are associated with well-defined right-lateral to oblique vertical faults, conjugate normal faults and vertical flow structures. Progressive transtensional deformation along the two main fault systems was the main mechanism for basin formation and the deposition of thick coarse-grained deposits close to basin-borders. The continuous opening of the basin provided intense intermediate and acid magmatism as well as deposition of volcaniclastic sediments. Event E2 characterizes generalized compression, recorded as minor thrust faults with tectonic transport toward the northwest and left-lateral activation of the NNE-SSW Palmital Shear Zone. Event E3 is related to the Mesozoic tectonism associated with the South Atlantic opening, which generated diabase dykes and predominantly right-lateral strike-slip faults oriented N10-50W. Its rhomboidal geometry with long axis parallel to major Precambrian shear zones, the main presence of high-angle, strike-slip or oblique faults, the asymmetric distribution of geological units and field evidence for concomitant Neoproterozoic magmatism and strike-slip movements are consistent with pull-apart basins reported in the literature.The role of post-collisional strike-slip tectonics in the geological evolution of the late Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary Guaratubinha Basin, southern Brazil - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (289KB)Download full-size imageThe role of post-collisional strike-slip tectonics in the geological evolution of the late Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary Guaratubinha Basin, southern Brazil - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectModeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectWe modeled the failure of magmatic foams using the fiber bundle model.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectBubble wall widths in foams were measured and used as fiber strengths in the model.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectModeled foam strengths were in agreement with previous experimental measurements.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectThe model predicts average power-law exponents of Stromboli's infrasonic activity.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectResults suggest a technique to predict recurrence intervals of paroxysmal eruptions.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectModeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling the failure of magmatic foams with application to Stromboli volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectCurrently at: Department of Earth Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 3B1, Canada.Deep structure and origin of active volcanoes in China - ScienceDirectHigh-K andesite petrogenesis and crustal evolution: Evidence from mafic and ultramafic xenoliths, Egmont Volcano (Mt.

Taranaki) and comparisons with Ruapehu Volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectGroup 1 and most Group 2 xenoliths have major, trace element and Sr, Nd and Pb isotope compositions indicating affinity with the host volcanic rocks. Geochemical variation can be modelled by assimilation fractional crystallisation (AFC) and fractional crystallisation (FC) of basaltic parents assuming an assimilant with the composition of average crystalline basement and Group 1 xenoliths have compositions approximating the solid material extracted during these processes. Some Group 2 xenoliths have relatively unevolved Sr and Nd isotopic compositions and they are interpreted to have derived as crystal cumulates from a more primitive parental basalt or through metasomatic alteration of other xenolith types by isotopically less evolved fluids or melts. Some Group 3 xenoliths could have originally been pyroxene cumulates but the granoblastic textures of others are more consistent with an origin as restites generated during anatexis of amphibolite. Group 4 xenoliths have textures similar to those of mantle-derived peridotite xenoliths found in intraplate basalts.High-K andesite petrogenesis and crustal evolution: Evidence from mafic and ultramafic xenoliths, Egmont Volcano (Mt. Taranaki) and comparisons with Ruapehu Volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThe geochemical variation is consistent with a system fed by mantle-derived magmas that underplated and intruded the lower crust. At this level AFC and FC and crustal anatexis generated cumulates and pyroxene restite represented by the mafic and ultramafic xenoliths. The magmas segregating at these deep levels moved higher into the crust where a complex dispersed magma storage and plumbing system formed. Here magmas evolved further through AFC and FC with the formation of cumulates and crystal mushes that are represented by some Group 1 and Group 2 xenoliths. Xenoliths were further modified by interaction with host magmas or by alteration at the side walls of magma storages and conduits.High-K andesite petrogenesis and crustal evolution: Evidence from mafic and ultramafic xenoliths, Egmont Volcano (Mt.

Numerical modeling of mud volcanoes, of which few exist, can provide insight into eruptive behavior and contribute to hazard evaluation. In this paper, we present a simple model to describe fluid escape from an underground reservoir through a conduit, extruded as a mud volcano at the surface. The governing equations result in oscillatory behavior, and we study the influence of changes in rheological properties of surrounding rock and fluid characteristics of the mud on extrusion dynamics. We focus on understanding long-term eruption behavior, flow cycles, and decay factors. Model results can be used to estimate the discharge rates and extruded volume from assumptions on the mud reservoir and conduit, or conversely, the reservoir or conduit properties from discharge rates.Modelling eruption cycles and decay of mud volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Eruptive history and tectonic setting of Medicine Lake Volcano, a large rear-arc volcano in the southern Cascades - ScienceDirectEruptive history and tectonic setting of Medicine Lake Volcano, a large rear-arc volcano in the southern Cascades - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The geochemical characteristics of the mud liquids in the Wushanting and Hsiaokunshui Mud Volcano region in southern Taiwan: Implications of humic substances for binding and mobilization of arsenic - ScienceDirectThe geochemical characteristics of the mud liquids in the Wushanting and Hsiaokunshui Mud Volcano region in southern Taiwan: Implications of humic substances for binding and mobilization of arsenic - ScienceDirectThe geochemical characteristics of the mud liquids in the Wushanting and Hsiaokunshui Mud Volcano region in southern Taiwan: Implications of humic substances for binding and mobilization of arsenic - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Doppler weather radar observations of the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectDoppler weather radar observations of the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectDoppler weather radar observations of the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Loss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectLoss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectLoss to residential buildings is computed for a re-eruption of Laacher See volcano.Loss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectThe loss depends on the wind-field which varies with season.Loss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectLoss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectThe estimated loss translates to Mean Damage Ratios (MDR) of about 4.Loss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectThe MDR is very close to the MDR of the 1991 VEI 6 Pinatubo eruption.Loss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectLoss of residential buildings in the event of a re-awakening of the Laacher See Volcano (Germany) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectStrombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectYasur's explosive styles equal ash-free and ash-rich explosive styles at Stromboli.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectEach explosive style has a distinct geophysical signature.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectThere is a general correlation between explosive style and explosion intensity.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectExplosive styles exhibit a regime-like persistence through time.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectCompared to Stromboli, Yasur exhibits an overall higher explosion intensity.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectIn late 2008 we recorded a continuous multi-parameter data set including Doppler radar, infrared and infrasound data at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu. Our recordings cover a transition in explosive style from ash-rich to ash-free explosions followed again by a phase of high ash discharge. To assess the present paradigm of Strombolian behavior in this study we investigate the geophysical signature of these different explosive episodes and compare our results to observations at Stromboli volcano, Italy. To this end we characterize Yasur's surface activity in terms of material movement, temperature and excess pressure. The joint temporal trend in these data reveals smooth variations of surface activity and regime-like persistence of individual explosion forms over days. Analysis of all data types shows ash-free and ash-rich explosive styles similar to those found at Stromboli volcano. During ash-free activity low echo powers, high explosion velocities and high temperatures result from the movement of isolated hot ballistic clasts. In contrast, ash-rich episodes exhibit high echo powers, low explosion velocities and low temperatures linked to the presence of colder ash-rich plumes. Furthermore ash-free explosions cause high excess pressure signals exhibiting high frequencies opposed to low-amplitude, low-frequency signals accompanying ash-rich activity. To corroborate these findings we compare fifteen representative explosions of each explosive episode. Explosion onset velocities derived from Doppler radar and infrared camera data are in excellent agreement and consistent with overall observations in each regime. Examination of infrasound recordings likewise confirms our observations, although a weak coupling between explosion velocity and excess pressure indicates changes in wave propagation. The overall trend in explosion velocity and excess pressure however demonstrates a general correlation between explosive style and explosion intensity, and points to stability of the uppermost conduit on timescales shorter than at Stromboli volcano.Strombolian surface activity regimes at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu, as observed by Doppler radar, infrared camera and infrasound - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Progressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectProgressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectIzu-Oshima volcano of Izu-Bonin arc shows systematic temporal geochemical variation.Progressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectEvidence of interaction between frontal arc and reararc magmas was obtained.Progressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectTemporal geochemical variation provides constraints on magma supply and its storage.Progressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectProgressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectProgressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectThis study demonstrates that interaction between frontal arc and backarc magma needs to be considered to achieve better understanding of material transfers and elemental budgets at subduction zones.Progressive mixed-magma recharging of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan: A guide to magma chamber volume - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectProlonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectA rimless depression (vent complex) includes at least 9 vents, analogous to a terrestrial compound volcano.Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectThe locus of eruption has migrated over time.Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectThe vents have a wide range of ages.Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectThe long axis of the vent complex is radial to the Caloris basin, and nearby vents fall close to the same line.Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectCaloris radial fracturing may extend at depth much nearer to the basin edge than is apparent at the surface.Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectProlonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Emplacement of the final lava dome of the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectEmplacement of the final lava dome of the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the stability of the final lava dome primarily resulted from sufficient fracturing and clearing of the conduit by preceding explosions that allowed efficient degassing of the magma during effusion.

The stress indicator principles, widely recognised for magmatic systems, have been discussed and applied to mud volcano settings such as in the Northern Apennines and the Azerbaijan Greater Caucasus, as well as in other instances where the analysis was fully based on a remote sensing study. The results of these applications are promising, the obtained maximum horizontal stress (SH) directions generally showing a good correlation with those determined in the upper crust by classical methods (i.e., earthquake focal mechanism solutions, well bore breakouts). Therefore, stress information from mud volcanoes could be used as a proxy for stress orientation (1) where stress data is lacking, (2) where settings are inaccessible (i.e., underwater or the surface of planets), or simply (3) as supplementary stress indicators. This study also pays special attention to structural elements that may control fluid expulsion at various length scales, and pathways that should have spawned the mud volcanoes and controlled their paroxysmal events and eruptions. Different types of sub-planar brittle elements have been found to focus fluid flow rising up-through fold cores, where the vertical zonation of stresses may take part in this process by creating distinctive feeder fracture/fault sets. On a regional scale, mud volcanoes in active fold-and-thrust belts may occur over wider areas, such as the prolific mud volcanism in Azerbaijan, or may cluster along discrete structures like the steep Pede-Apennine thrust in the Northern Apennines, where the generation of overpressures is expected to establish a positive feedback loop allowing for fault movement and mud volcanism.Mud volcanoes: Indicators of stress orientation and tectonic controls - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The geomorphology of the flanks of the Lord Howe Island volcano, Tasman Sea, Australia - ScienceDirectThe geomorphology of the flanks of the Lord Howe Island volcano, Tasman Sea, Australia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectAssessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectAquifer of Djibouti is vulnerable to contamination by anthropological activities.Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectHydrogeochemical explored as a tool of protecting groundwater resources.Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectMultivariate statistics with geochemical modeling revealed the main sources of contamination.Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectTwo factors were found that explained major hydrochemical processes in the aquifer.Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectThere are a relationship between seawater intrusion and recharge contamination.Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectAssessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa - ScienceDirectThe Principal component Analysis and the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis have led to the confirmation of the hypotheses developed in the previous hydrochemical study in which two factors explain the major hydrochemical processes in the aquifer.

Application to data acquired at Vulcano Island (southern Italy) from 1993 to 1996 - ScienceDirectUnderstanding the dynamics of volcanic-hydrothermal systems is a key factor for discriminating between magmatic and hydrothermal nature of the sources responsible for the unrest phenomena observed in active volcanic areas. Numerous studies of geophysical data monitoring in volcano-geothermal districts has indeed proven that close relationships exist between the volcanic and hydrothermal fluid circulation and the anomalous geophysical signals observed at the ground surface. In this paper, a simultaneous analysis that integrates resistivity and gravity data is suggested as a useful tool to infer a consistent conceptual model of hydrothermal volcanic systems and their evolution. An application of the proposed analysis to repeated resistivity and gravity measurements performed on Vulcano Island (Aeolian Archipelago, Sicily, southern Italy) is presented with the aim of gaining information on the dynamics of the volcanic-hydrothermal system. The examined period ranges from December 1993 to September 1996, when significant changes in chemical properties, temperatures and emission rates of La Fossa crater fumaroles were observed, all indicating an increase in the flux of hot deep magmatic gases. The results of our analysis, which refers to a profile located at the foot of the northwest flank of La Fossa cone, suggest that underground cyclic water-to-vapour transformations govern the shallow hydrothermal system dynamics, generally described by a negative correlation between the monitored resistivity and gravity data. The occurrence of positive correlations between the two analysed parameters could be ascribed to volcanic dynamics, which would mask the normal hydrological and hydrothermal system behaviour.Joint analysis of electric and gravimetric data for volcano monitoring.

The main pyroclastic flow events occurring at Arenal during the present period of eruptive activity have been characterized and simulated using the geophysical flow model TITAN2D. The simulations performed, coupled with analyses of the evolution of Arenal concerning the topographic and morphological development of the volcanic edifice and the eruptive activity; provide insight into various temporal and spatial patterns of pyroclastic flow hazard. Increased pyroclastic flow frequency is shown to be related to the vertical growth rate of the active crater. The topographic evolution of the volcanic edifice and of the morphology of the lava field explain several observed spatial hazard patterns relating to flow directionality and run-out, and lava effusion rates are shown to be related to pyroclastic flow magnitude and volume. Identified patterns highlight the dynamism of pyroclastic flow hazard at Arenal, and its close relationship to the evolution of the volcanic edifice and of the eruptive activity. The simulations performed also draw attention to the sensitivity of pyroclastic flow emplacement to topographic features and to topographic change, highlighting the importance of up to date and accurate representations of the topography (DEMs) of the volcano for related hazard assessments.Spatial and temporal controls on pyroclastic flow hazard at Arenal volcano, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectSpatial and temporal controls on pyroclastic flow hazard at Arenal volcano, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectEvolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectPartial melting of ocean crust involved in generation of primary magmas.Evolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectHydrous melts of MORB exert a control over key trace elements.Evolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectBasaltic andesites and andesites are the product of FC and AFC.Evolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectPartial melting of underplated amphibole-basalt at mid-crustal depths.Evolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectEvolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectErupted lavas from Mutnovsky Volcano provide evidence for partial melting of the subducting slab, which likely occurs along the entire Kamchatka volcanic front based on comparison of regional data.Download full-size imageEvolution and genesis of volcanic rocks from Mutnovsky Volcano, Kamchatka - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Precursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectPrecursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThree swarms of earthquakes with unusual characteristics preceded the first eruption of Tongariro volcano in over a century.Precursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectPrecursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThe seismicity alerted us that an eruption was possible, but provided no indication of timing.Precursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectPrecursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectPrecursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectPrecursory characteristics of the seismicity before the 6 August 2012 eruption of Tongariro volcano, North Island, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThis seismicity alerted GNS Science and other organisations to the unrest of Tongariro, and the Volcanic Alert Level and Aviation Colour Code were raised to publicise this.

Amiata volcano (Italy) - ScienceDirectThe most evident change occurred in the registered signals over the period is represented by the sudden increase in CO2 concentration measured starting from April 2010. Along with this increase in CO2, a slight increase in water temperature and in SO4 concentration, associated to a decrease in pH, was also recorded. This trend has been interpreted as an evidence for the augmented inflow of deep gases into the shallow aquifer. The CO2 continuous signal recorded by the Bagnore automatic station has been then processed by applying multiple statistical techniques (i.e. artificial neural network analysis and Census I method) in the search for anomalies possibly related to local seismic activity. Anomalous signals have been detected starting from April 24, 2010, and the correlation with the most energetic seismic events has been tentatively proposed.Detecting CO2 anomalies in a spring on Mt.

They exhibit a broad range of morphological properties that are here classified as Type 1 (steep-sided cones typically with a summit crater), Type 2 (nearly flat features with single or multiple central/summit craters or cones) and Type 3 (nearly circular features in plan view, characterized by steep sides and a broadly flat summit area). Their origins have not been determined with certainty, but our study utilizing the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images supports the interpretation of mud volcanism, based on the observed morphological characteristics of these small edifices and comparisons with terrestrial analogs. Additionally, hydrated minerals detected on these edifice features in data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), further support the mud volcano hypothesis. Injection features such as clastic mega-pipes and sand blow features may coexist with the mud volcanoes. Alternative mechanisms such as magmatic volcanism are not excluded, but they have less support from our remote sensing observations. Further confirmation or rejection of the mud volcano hypothesis will require in-situ investigation by landers or rovers.Small edifice features in Chryse Planitia, Mars: Assessment of a mud volcano hypothesis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Living with volcanoes: The sustainable livelihoods approach for volcano-related opportunities - ScienceDirectAlthough the negative impacts of volcanism on society are well documented and accepted, many possible benefits from volcanoes are not always fully considered. This paper provides suggestions for understanding and implementing volcanoes' benefits by suggesting further application of existing risk management frameworks to volcanology: living with risk by using the sustainable livelihoods approach at the local level. This paper presents an overview bringing established paradigms into volcanic risk management where they are sometimes absent despite their advantages.

However, the sustainable livelihoods approach is not a panacea, so limitations are discussed along with why living near a volcano cannot solve all livelihood concerns.

This is notably well-shown by the compilation of historical data onshore Trinidad. It appears that each eruptive mud volcano has its own period of catastrophic activity, and this period is variable from one volcano to another. The frequency of the eruptions seems essentially controlled by local pressure regime within the sedimentary pile. The dynamics of expulsion of the mud volcanoes during the quiescent phases has been studied with the help of temperature measurements within the mud conduits. The mud temperature in these conduits is notably concurrently controlled by the gas flux (endothermic gas depressurizing induces a cooling effect), and by the mud flux (mud is a vector for convective heat transfer). Complex temperature distribution was observed in large conduits and pools. Especially in the bigger pools, the temperature distribution characterizes convective cells with an upward displacement of mud above the deep outlet, and ring-shaped rolls associated with the burial of the mud on the flanks of the pools. In tube-like shaped narrow conduits, the temperature is more regular, but we observed different types of profiles, with either downward increasing or decreasing temperatures. Near constant to even negative gradients compared to the general temperature gradient are typical for very dynamic fluid systems. The temperature profiles varied from one place to another, as well as over time. The temperatures measured within the conduits and their base show that the fluid flow is not constant but highly variable through short time-periods. We observed locally a significant daily change of the temperature of the expelled mud which shows also that the mud flux is changing very rapidly due to the migration dynamics of the mud in fracture systems. We also observed very short time-period cyclic variations with a frequency of several minutes. These high frequencies temperature changes could be related to the dynamics of two-phase flows (gas and mud) through the mud volcano conduits.Cyclic activity of mud volcanoes: Evidences from Trinidad (SE Caribbean) -

ScienceDirectEarthquake triggering of hydrothermal and volcanic systems is ubiquitous, but the underlying processes driving these systems are not well-understood. We numerically investigate the influence of seismic wave interaction with volcanic systems simulated as a trapped, high-pressure fluid reservoir connected to a fluid-filled fault system in a 2-D poroelastic medium. Different orientations and earthquake magnitudes are studied to quantify dynamic and static stress, and pore pressure changes induced by a seismic event. Results show that although the response of the system is mainly dominated by characteristics of the radiated seismic waves, local structures can also play an important role on the system dynamics. The fluid reservoir affects the seismic wave front, distorts the static overpressure pattern induced by the earthquake, and concentrates the kinetic energy of the incoming wave on its boundaries. The static volumetric stress pattern inside the fault system is also affected by the local structures. Our results show that local faults play an important role in earthquake-volcanic systems dynamics by concentrating kinetic energy inside and acting as wave-guides that have a breakwater-like behavior. This generates sudden changes in pore pressure, volumetric expansion, and stress gradients. Local structures also influence the regional Coulomb yield function. Our results show that local structures affect the dynamics of volcanic and hydrothermal systems, and should be taken into account when investigating triggering of these systems from nearby or distant earthquakes.Numerical simulations (2D) on the influence of pre-existing local structures and seismic source characteristics in earthquake-volcano interactions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Structural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectStructural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectA previously unreported active fault system has been identified.Structural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectThe active fault system is generated by caldera resurgence.Structural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectMain thermal anomalies of the ground are related to the caldera structure and resurgence.Structural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectAn inferred magmatic intrusion is responsible for resurgence, recent volcanism and geothermal activity.Structural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectStructural analysis and thermal remote sensing of the Los Humeros Volcanic Complex: Implications for volcano structure and geothermal exploration - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Isolation of aquatic yeasts with the ability to neutralize acidic media, from an extremely acidic river near Japan's Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano - ScienceDirectThe Yukawa River is an extremely acidic river whose waters on the east foot of the Kusatu-Shirane Volcano (in Gunma Prefecture, Japan) contain sulfate ions. Here we isolated many acid-tolerant yeasts from the Yukawa River, and some of them neutralized an acidic R2A medium containing casamino acid. Candida fluviatilis strain CeA16 had the strongest acid tolerance and neutralizing activity against the acidic medium. To clarify these phenomena, we performed neutralization tests with strain CeA16 using casamino acid, a mixture of amino acids, and 17 single amino acid solutions adjusted to pH 3.0, respectively. Strain CeA16 neutralized not only acidic casamino acid and the mixture of amino acids but also some of the acidic single amino acid solutions. Seven amino acids were strongly decomposed by strain CeA16 and simultaneously released ammonium ions. These results suggest strain CeA16 is a potential yeast as a new tool to neutralize acidic environments.Isolation of aquatic yeasts with the ability to neutralize acidic media, from an extremely acidic river near Japan's Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectVolatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectVolatile fluxes from volcanoes at subduction zones are reviewed.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectPersistent degassing is the major emission source of most of volatiles.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectDiffuse emission of H2O, CO2 and Cl by springs and soil gases are also important.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectLower crust foundering controls the volatile budget of the subduction zone crust.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectGlobal volatile fluxes from subaerial volcanoes at subduction zones were estimated based on a compilation of fluxes from various sources, including persistent degassing, hot and cold springs, soil degassing, and eruptions. Because worldwide comprehensive datasets are not available, especially for diffuse volatile discharges, volatile fluxes from Japan arcs were estimated based on detailed datasets, and the regional fluxes were extrapolated to the global flux with consideration of the regional characteristics of volcanic volatile compositions, which were estimated based on volcanic gas compositions of persistent degassing. The estimated global fluxes indicate that persistent degassing is the major source of volatiles, especially for S with a contribution of 80%. Diffuse discharges and persistent degassing are similarly important sources of H2O, CO2, and Cl, but the contribution of explosive eruptions is less than 15% for all the volatiles. The estimates of diffuse degassing fluxes include large errors due to limited data. However, the potential impact of these sources on the global flux indicates the importance of further studies to quantify these fluxes. The volatile budget of subduction zone volcanism was evaluated by comparing the estimated volatile fluxes, the volatile contents in the crust, and the primitive magma volatile contents. The contribution of volatiles remaining in the crust are not significant; however, consideration of lower crust foundering significantly alters the volatile budget estimate because the primitive magma supply rate should be significantly increased to account for the lower crust foundering.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectThe eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectWe analyse the geomorphology and the stratigraphy of the eastern flank of the Merapi volcano.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectWe describe the lithological facies of the eastern flank of the Merapi.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectWe have identified a drainage anomaly caused by a detritic fan.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectWe update the conceptual model of the stratovolcanoes edifices.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectMerapi volcano in central Java Island is considered to be the most active and dangerous andesitic volcano in Indonesia. The volcanic history of Merapi volcano is complex, and often perturbed by frequent episodes of eruptive edifice building and subsequent erosion and collapse. In this paper, we present a detailed field, literature, and GIS-study of the well-preserved eastern flank of Merapi, which has been spared from major eruptions, in order to reconstruct the geologic and geomorphic history of the edifice. Here, the most recent deposits arise from the remobilization of the old volcanic materials by lahar, gravitational collapse of massive lava flow and local landslide processes.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectIn this study, we describe the specific deposits and subsequent alteration and removal processes. The stratigraphic analysis was performed with respect to the distinct phases of construction due to eruptions and dismantling of the volcano by erosion, gravitational collapse and the associated local to distal re-sedimentation. Based on GIS analysis and field surveys, a drainage network anomaly was detected in two main rivers, the Soka and the Brambang Rivers. We infer that an apex fan of volcaniclastic material was deposited into a central paleo-Pusur river and explains the abnormal divergence of the rivers. A new lithological 3D conceptual model is proposed based on the characterization of the lithological facies and their temporal and spatial evolution along the eastern flank of Merapi volcano.The eastern flank of the Merapi volcano (Central Java, Indonesia): Architecture and implications of volcaniclastic deposits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Episodic slow slip events and seaward flank motion at Mt.

The ability to use these thermal precursors to monitor the volcano and obtain early warning about upcoming activity is beneficial for both human safety and infrastructure security. By using a very reliably active volcano, Stromboli Volcano in Italy, a method has been developed and tested to look at changes in the frequency of small scale explosive activity and how this activity changes prior to larger, ash producing explosive events. Thermal camera footage was used to designate parameters for typical explosions at Stromboli (size of spatter field, cooling rate, frequency of explosions) and this information was applied to characterize explosions in satellite imagery. Satellite data from The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and US/Japan designed Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for numerous periods in 2002 to 2009 were analyzed for thermal features which were used to calculate an estimate of the level of activity during the given time period. The results at Stromboli showed a high level of small scale explosions which stop completely prior to large paroxysmal eruptive episodes. This activity also corresponds well to seismic and infrasonic records at Stromboli, indicating that this thermal infrared monitoring method may be used in conjunction with other detection methods where available, and also indicates that it may be a useful method for volcano monitoring when other methods (e.g. seismic instrumentation, infrasound arrays, etc.) are not available.Frequency based detection and monitoring of small scale explosive activity by comparing satellite and ground based infrared observations at Stromboli Volcano, Italy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Voluminous ice-rich and water-rich lahars generated during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectVoluminous ice-rich and water-rich lahars generated during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectVoluminous ice-rich and water-rich lahars generated during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.3D electrical resistivity imaging of the near-surface structure of mud-volcano vents - ScienceDirect3D electrical resistivity imaging of the near-surface structure of mud-volcano vents - ScienceDirect3D electrical resistivity imaging of the near-surface structure of mud-volcano vents - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Deformation of Copahue volcano: Inversion of InSAR data using a genetic algorithm - ScienceDirectDeformation of Copahue volcano: Inversion of InSAR data using a genetic algorithm - ScienceDirectDeformation of Copahue volcano: Inversion of InSAR data using a genetic algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.High precision relocation of earthquakes at Iliamna Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectHigh precision relocation of earthquakes at Iliamna Volcano, Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Contrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectContrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectWe compared pre- and syn-eruptive conditions of lavas from two nearby volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle and Villarica.Contrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectContrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectA shallow reservoir beneath Villarrica volcano was recognized.Contrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectHeating of the shallow Villarrica reservoir took place prior to the studied lava.Contrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectSimilar syn-eruptive conditions were obtained for the studied lavas.Contrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectContrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectContrasting records from mantle to surface of Holocene lavas of two nearby arc volcanic complexes: Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers and Villarrica Volcano, Southern Chile - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessment and improvement of a robust satellite technique (RST) for thermal monitoring of volcanoes - ScienceDirectThe RST approach (robust satellite technique) is a multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis already successfully used to monitor volcanoes at different geographic locations. In this work, the results of a long-term validation analysis of RST-based hot spot products are presented. This study was performed processing fourteen years of NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) records acquired over Mt. Etna area between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2008, at different overpass times (day/night), and analyzing hundreds of volcano bulletins reporting information on Mt. Etna eruptive activity, provided by visual observations and ground-based measurements. An optimized configuration of the RST approach, named RSTVOLC, is also, for the first time, presented and discussed here. This method, thanks to a better tradeoff between reliability and sensitivity, may be particularly suitable to support operational systems for volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation.Assessment and improvement of a robust satellite technique (RST) for thermal monitoring of volcanoes - ScienceDirectAssessment and improvement of a robust satellite technique (RST) for thermal monitoring of volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volcanoes and travel medicine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Englacial tephrostratigraphy of Erebus volcano, Antarctica - ScienceDirectEnglacial tephrostratigraphy of Erebus volcano, Antarctica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Magma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectMagma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectMagma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectThe depths of the reservoirs are consistent with seismicity of the study area.Magma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectMagma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectAt least three magmatic components were mixed to form the TS lava.Magma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectThe lava eruption occurred within a month or less of the magma mixing.Magma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectMagma reservoir conditions beneath Tsurumi volcano, SW Japan: Evidence from amphibole thermobarometry and seismicity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mud volcano origin of the Mottled Zone, South Levant - ScienceDirectMud volcano origin of the Mottled Zone, South Levant - ScienceDirectMud volcano origin of the Mottled Zone, South Levant - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageMud volcano origin of the Mottled Zone, South Levant - ScienceDirectMud volcano origin of the Mottled Zone, South Levant - ScienceDirectYevgeny Vapnik: Senior Researcher in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, since 1991.

Usually, expert technicians read features extracted from the seismogram, such as, cepstral derived coefficients, energy centroids, instant frequency, instant envelop, among others. However, there are few studies about the selection of important features for classifying several types of seismic events, i.e., taking into account the temporal contribution of each considered feature. This paper presents a feature selection strategy based on a relevance measure of time-variant features for seismic event classification. In this research, features are selected as those with the maximal information preserved within the time analysis. Since features selection stage is performed by incremental training, a simple k-nearest neighbor classification rule is used to properly determine the dimension of the final feature set. The employed feature extraction and feature selection methodologies are tested on an isolated event recognition task. The database used to test the methodology is composed of the following classes: volcano-tectonic, long period earthquakes, tremors and hybrid events. Data was recorded at the seismic monitoring stations located at the Nevado-del-Ruiz volcano, Colombia. Using a classifier based on hidden Markov models, accomplished results exhibit a performance improvement from 78% to 88% using the proposed methodology in comparison to the state-of-the-art feature sets.Selection of time-variant features for earthquake classification at the Nevado-del-Ruiz volcano - ScienceDirectSelection of time-variant features for earthquake classification at the Nevado-del-Ruiz volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Linear volcanic segments in the central Sunda Arc, Indonesia, identified using Hough Transform analysis: Implications for arc lithosphere control upon volcano distribution - ScienceDirectLinear volcanic segments in the central Sunda Arc, Indonesia, identified using Hough Transform analysis: Implications for arc lithosphere control upon volcano distribution - ScienceDirectThe en echelon distribution of volcanoes in the central Sunda Arc is best explained as originating from two possible sources. First, interaction with the subducting Indo-Australian Plate may induce stress in the arc lithosphere generating pathways for magma to exploit. Second, downward flexure of the arc lithosphere, as a result of mantle flow or loading by the arc, would also establish arc-normal tension towards the base of the lithosphere, where magma is supplied to volcanic systems.Linear volcanic segments in the central Sunda Arc, Indonesia, identified using Hough Transform analysis: Implications for arc lithosphere control upon volcano distribution - ScienceDirectTo the west and east of the central Sunda Arc deviations from the distribution of long, en echelon, linear segments can be understood as responses to specific stress fields in the arc lithosphere of Sumatra and eastern Nusa Tenggara, respectively. Control of volcano distribution by arc lithosphere explains why there are large variations in the depth from volcanoes to the zone of slab seismicity in the central Sunda Arc, where there is little variation in slab geometry or the rate of plate convergence.Linear volcanic segments in the central Sunda Arc, Indonesia, identified using Hough Transform analysis: Implications for arc lithosphere control upon volcano distribution - ScienceDirectLinear volcanic segments in the central Sunda Arc, Indonesia, identified using Hough Transform analysis: Implications for arc lithosphere control upon volcano distribution - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Linear volcanic segments in the central Sunda Arc, Indonesia, identified using Hough Transform analysis: Implications for arc lithosphere control upon volcano distribution - ScienceDirectNow at: Department of Earth Science & Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ, UK.Embayed intermediate volcanoes on Venus: Implications for the evolution of the volcanic plains - ScienceDirectVolcanoes on Venus are classified according to size with studies on the stratigraphic position of large volcanoes proposing that most of the large volcanoes postdate the regional volcanic materials. Some studies regarding intermediate volcanoes proposed that some of these volcanic features could be large volcanoes with embayed flow aprons, a situation that would alter the previous stratigraphic considerations about large volcanoes on Venus.Embayed intermediate volcanoes on Venus: Implications for the evolution of the volcanic plains - ScienceDirectIn this work I analyze the global population of embayed intermediate-size volcanoes and compare their summits with that of other edifices classified as large volcanoes. Intermediate-size volcanoes are considered embayed when: (1) flows from another source clearly overlap the volcano slopes, and (2) display scarps related to flank-failure processes but with the associated collapse deposits being absent (i.e. interpreted as covered). As result of the survey 88 embayed intermediate-size volcanoes have been catalogued and integrated into a Geographic Information System. These embayed volcanoes have summit sizes and characteristics similar to large volcanoes and, therefore, could be interpreted as possible large volcanoes with their flow aprons embayed. Embayment materials for these volcanoes include all the units present in the history of the volcanic plains and would indicate that this type of central volcanic edifice would occur throughout the geologic history recorded in the venusian plains.Embayed intermediate volcanoes on Venus: Implications for the evolution of the volcanic plains -

ScienceDirectTwo albitite layers were discovered near Lula village within a volcano-sedimentary sequence of likely Ordovician age in the Internal Nappe Zone (NE Sardinia). The albitites consist of up to 95% albite, with small amounts of quartz, biotite, chlorite, Fe-oxides, apatite, and monazite. They are the first albitites to be found in NE Sardinia, and the first known case of Ordovician albitites. In central and southern Sardinia the albitites occur as late Variscan dykes and small intrusions. The albitization process is attributed to hydrothermal fluids produced during the late stages of middle Ordovician volcano-plutonic activity. A comparison of the albitite compositions with the non-albitized samples reveals that albitites are characterized by strong gains of Na, slight gains of Al, Si, and Sr, and remarkable losses of K, Rb, Ba, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ti, Ni, and V. These albitites are also enriched in LREE and depleted in HREE.Ordovician Albitites Generated by Magmatic Fluids within a Volcano-Sedimentary Sequence from NW Sardinia - ScienceDirectThe volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThe volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThe volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThree volcanic centers were discovered through volcanic facies association.The volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThe main volcanic edifice in the northern Coastal Range has already been subducted.The volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThe exposed lithofacies show the erosion degree increases from south to north.The volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThe evolution of an oceanic arc from birth to death is recorded in the Northern Luzon Arc.The volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectThe volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction: A case from the northern Luzon Arc - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Some aspect of seismicity prior to the 27 November 2006 eruption of Nyamuragira volcano and its implication for volcano monitoring and risk mitigation in the Virunga area, Western Rift Valley of Africa - ScienceDirectSome aspect of seismicity prior to the 27 November 2006 eruption of Nyamuragira volcano and its implication for volcano monitoring and risk mitigation in the Virunga area, Western Rift Valley of Africa - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Chapter 7 Volcano-tectonic earthquakes at dacitic volcanoes - ScienceDirectThis chapter discusses the volcano-tectonic earthquakes associated with central and flank eruptions. The eruptions of dacitic volcanoes may occur from the central crater and from the new vents on the flank of a volcano. The lava effusion from the central and flank vents may be accompanied by a volcanic tremor. Dacitic volcanoes have a low altitude and a stratovolcano shape. The central eruption of dacitic volcanoes may have the growth of a dome in the crater with a possible formation of lava and (or) a great explosion or a sequence of numerous small explosions. The most famous dacitic volcanoes with central eruptions are Mount St. Helens in the United States, Usu in Japan, Pinatubo in the Philippines, and Karymsky in Kamchatka. Volcano-tectonic earthquakes are related to lava dome eruptions and magmatic explosions. There are only two cases of volcano-tectonic earthquakes associated with flank eruptions, and they are related to the activity of Usu volcano in Hokkaido.Chapter 7 Volcano-tectonic earthquakes at dacitic volcanoes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geotourism and volcanoes: Health hazards facing tourists at volcanic and geothermal destinations - ScienceDirectVolcano tourism and tourism to geothermal destinations is increasingly popular. If such endeavors are to be a sustainable sector of the tourism industry, tourists must be made aware of the potential health hazards facing them in volcanic environments. With the aim of creating awareness amongst the tourism industry and practitioners of travel medicine, this paper reviews the potential influences and effects of volcanic gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and hydrogen chloride/hydrochloric acid (HCl). It also reviews the negative health impacts of tephra and ash, lava flows, landslides, and mudflows. Finally, future research striving to quantify the health risks facing volcano tourists is recommended.Geotourism and volcanoes: Health hazards facing tourists at volcanic and geothermal destinations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reventador Volcano 2005: Eruptive activity inferred from seismo-acoustic observation - ScienceDirectReventador Volcano entered an eruptive phase in 2005 which included a wide variety of seismic and infrasonic activity. These are described and illustrated: volcano-tectonic, harmonic tremor, drumbeats, chugging and spasmodic tremor, long period and very long period events. The recording of this simultaneous activity on an array of three broadband, seismo-acoustic instruments provides detailed information of the state of the conduit and vent during this phase of volcanic eruption. Quasi-periodic tremor at Reventador is similar to that observed at other volcanoes and may be used as an indicator of vent aperture. Variations in the vibration modes of the volcano, frequency fluctuations and rapid temporal fluctuations suggest the influx of new material, choking of the vent and possible modification of the conduit geometry during explosions and effusion over a period of six weeks.Reventador Volcano 2005: Eruptive activity inferred from seismo-acoustic observation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Interview: Working in the volcano's mouth - ScienceDirectIf it's ultra-fresh volcanic gas and lava you want, there's nothing for it but to climb into the mouth of a volcano, says geologist Ken SimsInterview: Working in the volcano's mouth - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Consequences of volcano sector collapse on magmatic storage zones: Insights from numerical modeling - ScienceDirectMajor volcano flank collapses strongly affect the underlying magmatic plumbing system. Here, we consider the magma storage zone as a liquid pocket embedded in an elastic medium, and we perform numerical simulations in two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry as well as in three dimensions in order to evaluate the consequences of a major collapse event. We quantify the pressure decrease induced within and around a magma reservoir by a volcano flank collapse. This pressure reduction is expected to favor replenishment with less evolved magma from deeper sources. We also estimate the impact of the magma pressure decrease, together with the stress field variations around the reservoir, on the eruptive event associated with the edifice failure. We show that, for a given magma reservoir geometry, the collapse of a large strato-volcano tends to reduce the volume of the simultaneous eruption; destabilization of large edifices may even suppress magma emission, resulting in phreatic eruptions instead. This effect is greater for shallow reservoirs, and is more pronounced for spherical reservoirs than for vertically-elongated ones. It is reduced for compressible magmas containing a large amount of volatiles. Over a longer time scale, the modification of pressure conditions for dyke initiation at the chamber wall may also explain an increase in eruption rate as well as an apparent change of magma storage location.Consequences of volcano sector collapse on magmatic storage zones: Insights from numerical modeling - ScienceDirectConsequences of volcano sector collapse on magmatic storage zones: Insights from numerical modeling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Consequences of volcano sector collapse on magmatic storage zones: Insights from numerical modeling - ScienceDirectNow at Royal Museum for Central Africa, Geology Department, Leuvensesteenweg 13, Box 3080, Tervuren, Belgium.Mud volcanoes and gas hydrates in the Anaximander mountains (Eastern Mediterranean Sea) - ScienceDirectMud volcanoes and gas hydrates in the Anaximander mountains (Eastern Mediterranean Sea) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Photogrammetric monitoring of lava dome growth during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectThe 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, began with a phreatic explosion on 15 March followed by a series of at least 19 explosive events and growth and destruction of at least two, and likely three, lava domes between 22 March and 4 April. On 4 April explosive activity gave way to continuous lava effusion within the summit crater. We present an analysis of post-4 April lava dome growth using an oblique photogrammetry approach that provides a safe, rapid, and accurate means of measuring dome growth. Photogrammetric analyses of oblique digital images acquired during helicopter observation flights and fixed-wing volcanic gas surveys produced a series of digital elevation models (DEMs) of the lava dome from 16 April to 23 September. The DEMs were used to calculate estimates of volume and time-averaged extrusion rates and to quantify morphological changes during dome growth.Photogrammetric monitoring of lava dome growth during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectPhotogrammetric monitoring of lava dome growth during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectPhotogrammetric monitoring of lava dome growth during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Soil gas geochemistry in relation to eruptive fissures on Timanfaya volcano, Lanzarote Island (Canary Islands, Spain) - ScienceDirectSoil gas geochemistry in relation to eruptive fissures on Timanfaya volcano, Lanzarote Island (Canary Islands, Spain) - ScienceDirectSoil gas geochemistry in relation to eruptive fissures on Timanfaya volcano, Lanzarote Island (Canary Islands, Spain) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Topographic and sedimentary features in the Yap subduction zone and their implications for the Caroline Ridge subduction - ScienceDirectTopographic and sedimentary features in the Yap subduction zone and their implications for the Caroline Ridge subduction - ScienceDirectLandslide deposits at the slope break of the Yap forearc are identified in the seismic profile.Topographic and sedimentary features in the Yap subduction zone and their implications for the Caroline Ridge subduction - ScienceDirectA seismic angular unconformity is revealed in the Sorol Trough indicating the onset of rifting.Topographic and sedimentary features in the Yap subduction zone and their implications for the Caroline Ridge subduction - ScienceDirectA modified model for the Yap subduction zone evolution is proposed.Topographic and sedimentary features in the Yap subduction zone and their implications for the Caroline Ridge subduction - ScienceDirectStrength of plate coupling in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectStrength of plate coupling in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectWe provide an improved structural geometry based on 2-D gravity modeling.Strength of plate coupling in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectPlate coupling status in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone is relatively strong.Strength of plate coupling in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectA potential great earthquake can be expected in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone.Strength of plate coupling in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectStrength of plate coupling in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectSubduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectProgress in our understanding of how new subduction zones form is reviewed.Subduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirect3 ways that new subduction zones formed are presented: polarity reversal, transform collapse, and plume margin collapse.Subduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectFuture advances in both 2D and 3D numerical modeling expectedSubduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectHow new subduction zones form is an emerging field of scientific research with important implications for our understanding of lithospheric strength, the driving force of plate tectonics, and Earth's tectonic history. We are making good progress towards understanding how new subduction zones form by combining field studies to identify candidates and reconstruct their timing and magmatic evolution and undertaking numerical modeling (informed by rheological constraints) to test hypotheses. Here, we review the state of the art by combining and comparing results coming from natural observations and numerical models of SI. Two modes of subduction initiation (SI) can be identified in both nature and models, spontaneous and induced. Induced SI occurs when pre-existing plate convergence causes a new subduction zone to form whereas spontaneous SI occurs without pre-existing plate motion when large lateral density contrasts occur across profound lithospheric weaknesses of various origin. We have good natural examples of 3 modes of subduction initiation, one type by induced nucleation of a subduction zone (polarity reversal) and two types of spontaneous nucleation of a subduction zone (transform collapse and plumehead margin collapse). In contrast, two proposed types of subduction initiation are not well supported by natural observations: (induced) transference and (spontaneous) passive margin collapse. Further work is therefore needed to expand on and understand the implications of these observations. Our future advancing understanding of SI will come from better geologic insights, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, and with improving communications between these communities.Subduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (205KB)Download full-size imageSubduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction rate of the primordial anorthosite and KREEP crust is evaluated.Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction channel is modeled by 1-D finite difference method.Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (347KB)Download full-size imageSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Kyushu, 744 Motooka, Nishi-ku, Fukuoka 819-0395, Japan.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectThe role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectSubduction-induced mantle flow provides the key force to trigger breakup of continents.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectTimescale and location of breakup depend on the style of subduction.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectMarginal basins form when subduction is upper mantle confined.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectLower mantle subduction localises extension in continental interiors.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectModeling results reconciles Pangaea dismembering.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectThe role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectSeismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectRecent findings on seismic imaging of Asian orogens and subduction zones.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectAnisotropic tomography provides new insight into continental tectonics and mantle dynamics.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectNew results on seismotectonics and intraplate volcanism.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectSeismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (407KB)Download full-size imageSeismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamics of the Ryukyu/Izu-Bonin-Marianas double subduction system - ScienceDirectDynamics of the Ryukyu/Izu-Bonin-Marianas double subduction system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectWhy primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectWe calculated the rheological structure of oceanic plate in Archean.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectThe plate strength in Archean was much smaller than that of present-day Earth.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectMore subduction zones had existed in Hadean and Archean.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectThe primordial continents were carried into deep mantle by tectonic erosion.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectGeological observations indicate that there are only a few rocks of Archean Earth and no Hadean rocks on the surface of the present-day Earth. From these facts, many scientists believe that the primordial continents never existed during Hadean Earth, and the continental volume has kept increasing. On the other hand, recent studies reported the importance of the primordial continents on the origin of life, implying their existence. In this paper, we discussed the possible process that could explain the loss of the primordial continents with the assumption that they existed in the Hadean. Although depending on the timing of the initiation of plate tectonics and its convection style, subduction erosion, which is observed on the present-day Earth, might have carried the primordial continents into the deep mantle.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (284KB)Download full-size imageWhy primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).Subduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectSubduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectDiatom-based paleogeodetic methods are used to reconstruct coseismic land-level change.Subduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectEvidence of variable coseismic slip documented where the AD 2010 and 1960 ruptures overlap.Subduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectMixed record of uplift and subsidence illustrates down-dip and lateral slip variability.Subduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectThe Arauco Peninsula has been a persistent impediment to slip over multiple earthquake cycles.Subduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectSubduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction zone slip variability during the last millennium, south-central Chile - ScienceDirectPeer Review DISCLAIMER: This draft manuscript is distributed solely for purposes of scientific peer review.

ScienceDirectCrustal components dominate the budget of incompatible trace elements and radiogenic isotopes in continental basalts.Continental basalts record the crust-mantle interaction in oceanic subduction channel: A geochemical case study from eastern China - ScienceDirectContinental basalts, erupted in either flood or rift mode, usually show oceanic island basalts (OIB)-like geochemical compositions. Although their depletion in Sr-Nd isotope compositions is normally ascribed to contributions from the asthenospheric mantle, their enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE) is generally associated with variable enrichments in the Sr-Nd isotope compositions. This indicates significant contributions from crustal components such as igneous oceanic crust, lower continental crust and seafloor sediment. Nevertheless, these crustal components were not incorporated into the mantle sources of continental basalts in the form of solidus rocks. Instead they were processed into metasomatic agents through low-degree partial melting in order to have the geochemical fractionation of the largest extent to achieve the enrichment of LILE and LREE in the metasomatic agents. Therefore, the mantle sources of continental basalts were generated by metasomatic reaction of the depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) mantle with hydrous felsic melts. Nevertheless, mass balance considerations indicate differential contributions from the mantle and crustal components to the basalts. While the depleted MORB mantle predominates the budget of major elements, the crustal components predominate the budget of melt-mobile incompatible trace elements and their pertinent radiogenic isotopes. These considerations are verified by model calculations that are composed of four steps in an ancient oceanic subduction channel: (1) dehydration of the subducting crustal rocks at subarc depths, (2) anataxis of the dehydrated rocks at postarc depths, (3) metasomatic reaction of the depleted MORB mantle peridotite with the felsic melts to generate ultramafic metasomatites in the lower part of the mantle wedge, and (4) partial melting of the metasomatites for basaltic magmatism. The composition of metasomatites is quantitatively dictated by the crustal metasomatism through melt-peridotite reaction at the slab-mantle interface in oceanic subduction channels. Continental basalts of Mesozoic to Cenozoic ages from eastern China are used as a case example to illustrate the above petrogenetic mechanism. Subduction of the paleo-Pacific oceanic slab beneath the eastern edge of Eurasian continent in the Early Mesozoic would have transferred the crustal signatures into the mantle sources of these basalts. This process would be associated with rollback of the subducting slab at that time, whereas the partial melting of metasomatites takes place mainly in the Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic to produce the continental basalts. Therefore, OIB-like continental basalts are also the product of subduction-zone magmatism though they occur in intraplate settings.Continental basalts record the crust-mantle interaction in oceanic subduction channel: A geochemical case study from eastern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectTracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectTianshan eclogites were interacted with two fluid components during exhumation.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-LILEs component is likely released from mica-group minerals.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-LILEs component contains a significant amount of isotopically heavy Mg.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-Pb component is possibly dehydrated from epidote-group minerals.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-Pb component contains too little Mg so as not to influence the eclogites.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectTracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectPartial melting of MORB-derived garnet amphibolites and generation of trondhjemite.Hot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (485KB)Download full-size imageHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Speculations on the impact of catastrophic subduction initiation on the Earth System - ScienceDirectThe physics of subduction initiation can be studied with numerical models of lithosphere dynamics, to the extent where we can now test the potential consequences of a catastrophic subduction initiation event on the Earth System. The South American Atlantic passive margin is here used to show that, once subduction has catastrophically initiated there, a major geodynamic reconfiguration of the South American plate (SAm) is likely to take place: (1) compression in the east will be inverted to extension, because ridge push will be replaced by subduction rollback and trench retreat; (2) compression in the west will be inverted to extension due to absolute rollback; and (3) without buttressing from the east and west, the Andes will collapse. Extension at both margins of continental SAm will produce two new volcanic arcs, several thousands of kilometres long each, bounded by trenches and two new back-arc basins. The spreading rate of the Mid-Atlantic Rift will significantly increase, because of the cumulative effect of ridge-push and slab-pull in the same direction. The substantially increased volcanism all around SAm and in the MAR will most likely release massive amounts of greenhouse and (toxic) gases into the atmosphere and oceans, which might lead to major oceanic and atmospheric circulation changes. We present new numerical modelling that supports the proposed evolution of the SAm after subduction has catastrophically initiated at its eastern passive margin.Speculations on the impact of catastrophic subduction initiation on the Earth System - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectDynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectComposition and rheology of the oceanic plateau control its accretion modes.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectSlab age and seaward overriding plate motion dominate the subduction angle and style.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectJurassic crustal growth in the Lhasa Terrane needs bottom accretion of oceanic plateaus.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectFlat to steep subduction transition explains magmatic distribution in the Lhasa Terrane.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectThe oceanic plateau subduction and resulted terrane accretion have played significant roles in the continental crustal growth; however, the modes and dynamics of plateau accretion during subduction remains poorly understood. The oceanic subduction can be driven by the combined effects of slab pull, ridge push, as well as the possible overriding plate push. The latter one has been rarely studied, but can be the case during the multiple Tethyan slabs subduction and terranes accretion for the formation of Tibetan lithosphere in the Mesozoic. Using 2-D petrological-thermo-mechanical models, we systematically investigated the modes and dynamics of terrane accretion during the dominant seaward continental drifting and oceanic plateau subduction. The model results show that the plateau with continental crustal affinity favors accretion to the overriding plate during the subduction process. Three distinct terrane accretion modes are identified: frontal accretion, bottom accretion, and a transitional mode with both the frontal and bottom accretion. In contrast, the plateau with oceanic crustal affinity generally favors subduction and recycling into the deeper mantle, rather than accretion, which is mainly due to the higher density and possible eclogitization of the oceanic crustal materials during subduction. The numerical simulations further reveal that the controlling factor for the subduction style, i.e. flat versus steep subduction, is the age of the oceanic slab and the seaward overriding plate motion. The rheological properties and the convergence rate play minor roles in affecting the subducting slab angle. The model results are further compared with the Jurassic magmatic rock distribution and geochemical characteristics of the Lhasa Terrane in Tibet, which reveals (1) the transition from flat to steep subduction of the southward Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan slab; and (2) the mechanism of Jurassic crustal growth in the central Lhasa subterrane which may be strongly correlated with the bottom accretion of the subducted oceanic plateau.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Migration of fluids and melts in subduction zones and general aspects of thermophysical modeling in geology - ScienceDirectMigration of fluids and melts in subduction zones and general aspects of thermophysical modeling in geology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectLate Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectThere are Late Paleozoic granitic plutons along the Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture.Late Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectLate Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectSubduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean began in the Late Devonian and lasted till the Triassic.Late Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectLate Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (206KB)Download full-size imageLate Paleozoic granitoids from central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau: A record of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectStable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectDeparture from meteoric conditions reflected in low d-excess and lc-excess values.Stable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectGreater rainfall inputs may mask the kinetic fractionation effect.Stable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectWaters are isotopically-close to meteoric conditions or altered by recycled fluids.Stable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectMean recycled fluid inputs: 15.3% (Nicaragua) and 19.7% (Costa Rica)Stable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectEnd-member calculations reflect the degree of mixing of recycled subduction fluids.Stable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectStable isotopes evidence of recycled subduction fluids in the hydrothermal/volcanic activity across Nicaragua and Costa Rica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recycling in the subduction factory: Archaean to Permian zircons in the oceanic Cretaceous Caribbean island-arc (Hispaniola) - ScienceDirectRecycling in the subduction factory: Archaean to Permian zircons in the oceanic Cretaceous Caribbean island-arc (Hispaniola) - ScienceDirectArchean to Permian zircons in Cretaceous intra-oceanic arc rocks from the CaribbeanRecycling in the subduction factory: Archaean to Permian zircons in the oceanic Cretaceous Caribbean island-arc (Hispaniola) - ScienceDirectInherited zircons of crustal origin;

Because no extensive accretionary prism has been growing along the Ryukyu Trench, the arc provides an opportunity to examine effects of ridge subduction on structure of the forearc wedge and a clue to reconstruct ancient plate motion of the PSP that is inferred to have changed between NW and NNW. To examine this perspective, we clarified structure of the Ryukyu forearc wedge based on seismic profiles and bathymetric data and related them to ridge subduction. An erosional unconformity between pre-Neogen and Neogene rocks is widely recognized through the Ryukyu Arc, and we divided the forearc wedges into Zones I to IV from southwest to northeast by difference of depth of the erosional unconformity. We correlated these four zones to the locations of ridge subduction that have been shifting NE or SW along the Ryukyu Trench. Zone I is underlain by the largely subsided unconformity and we attributed the structure to tearing of the Eurasia plate due to subduction of the western margin of the PSP including the Luzon Arc. Zone II consists of a wide terrace on the shallow erosional unconformity, and no ridge that was subducting in this zone is known. Zone III is characterized by the seaward descending unconformity covered with a thick sequence of Neogene sediments and is related to subduction of the NW-SE trending Daito Ridge and the E-W trending Amami Plateau. Zone IV has the deeper unconformity and slope geometry and corresponds to subduction of the NNW-SSE trending Kyushu-Palau Ridge. The structure of the Ryukyu forearc is consistently related to subduction of ridges on the PSP, suggesting that the change of the plate motion of the PSP can be precisely reconstructed by further detailed survey.Differential subsidence of the forearc wedge of the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc caused by subduction of ridges on the Philippine Sea Plate - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Water in garnet pyroxenite from the Sulu orogen: Implications for crust-mantle interaction in continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectWater in garnet pyroxenite from the Sulu orogen: Implications for crust-mantle interaction in continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNumerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectWe present self-consistent subduction models with non-linear rheologies.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectBoth the thickness of overriding plate and the thermal age of slab are investigated.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThick upper plate increases the flexural wavelength and its magnitude.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectModels show that fundamental force balance of subduction depends on buoyancy.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThe mechanical strength of the oceanic lithospheres exerts a fundamental control on the dynamics and tectonics of convergent margins. Here, we use numerical models of coupled subducting-upper plates and mantle to investigate the impact of the subducting lithosphere properties on the parameters commonly measured at subduction zones. The models predict a correlation among parameters such as subducting and convergence velocities, slab dip and curvature, and stress coupling with the upper plates, such signature emerges in a dynamic system through the slab buoyancy. Similar trends are found when assessing the impact of laboratory-constrained non-linear rheologies uncertainties on the mechanical strength and mantle flow, although some features are more affected. When the role of upper plate thickness is tested, we find a positive correlation of upper plate subsidence and fore-arc topography with the buoyancy of the down-going plate. However, plasticity in the crust limits the development of topography, becoming increasingly relevant with thinner upper plates, so that no correlation can be established. Similar control is found on the width of the long-wavelength dynamic subsidence, due to flexure, which increases non-linearly with the upper plate thickness. The models constrain relations among parameters within the dynamic system driven that allow inferences on the observable parameters. The comparisons supports the idea that the subduction dynamics emerges as a global phenomenon in plate motions, bending and dynamic subsidence, yet Andean-type margin tectonics is best addressed in a regional context.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNow at: Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, Science Labs, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGlobal correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectCorrelating 24 subduction parameters and maximum earthquakes at subduction zones.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGlobal correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectEpicenters of giant earthquakes only occur at compressive/neutral overriding plates.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGiant earthquakes might be triggered at normal stress asperities on interface.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGiant earthquakes require gentle thrust dip, slow trench motion and flat interface.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectSeismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectSeismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectReveal the internal fine structure of the MTZ beneath the northeastern South China Sea using the high sensitive triplication method.Seismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectA high-velocity anomaly is found in the mantle transition zone.Seismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectPropose that new geodynamic model that the high-velocity anomaly in the MTZ was caused by the broken fragments from the high angle diving oceanic plate falling into the MTZ, and/or by the unstable thick continental lithosphere dropping into the MTZ sequentially or almost simultaneously.

Global averages of plate margin geometries, sediment thickness, plate age, and convergence rate are used to construct generic models of accretionary and erosive margins. Of these parameters, our analysis shows that the largest uncertainty in these models is the geotherm for the incoming oceanic plate. Despite these uncertainties, the subduction thrust of similarly aged accretionary margins is slightly warmer than erosive margins primarily due to the effect of sediment insulating the subduction thrust at accretionary margins. If the updip limit of seismicity is thermally controlled, warmer accretionary margins suggest shallower seismogenic updip limits, counter to the observation that erosional margins are more likely to generate tsunamigenic earthquakes. This discrepancy can be reconciled if frictional heat generation at erosive margins is larger than at accretionary margins.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins -

On the basis of melting experiments of hydrous peridotites, we further propose that most mantle-derived melts and thus U-series disequilibria should be mainly produced by melting in the hot zone of the mantle wedge, as controlled by thermal structure of the convergent margins. In order to produce enough short-lived nuclides, the timescales of mass transfer and magmatism in the subduction zone should at least range from a few to a few hundred millennia. Future studies on more lavas, numerical modelling, and partition coefficients of U-series nuclides will help for better application of U-series disequilibria into subduction zone magmatism.U-series disequilibria in subduction zone lavas: Inherited from subducted slabs or produced by mantle in-growth melting? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Lithification facilitates frictional instability in argillaceous subduction zone sediments - ScienceDirectLithification facilitates frictional instability in argillaceous subduction zone sediments - ScienceDirectLithified rock samples exhibit the potential for unstable slip behavior.Lithification facilitates frictional instability in argillaceous subduction zone sediments - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the change is driven by cementation and porosity loss.Lithification facilitates frictional instability in argillaceous subduction zone sediments - ScienceDirectOur results provide that the lithification hypothesis can explain the up-dip limit.Lithification facilitates frictional instability in argillaceous subduction zone sediments - ScienceDirectLithification facilitates frictional instability in argillaceous subduction zone sediments - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectTwo magmatic arcs on the opposing overriding Lhasa and Qiangtang terranesAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectAbsence of Early Cretaceous high-grade metamorphic rocksAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectDivergent double-sided subduction of the Bangong oceanic lithosphereAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectThe tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic history of the Tethys orogen is reviewed.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectFew rocks and mineral deposits survive from the Paleotethys.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectSome deposits are subduction-related, but many are collision-related.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectCollisional deposits are formed by remobilization of subduction-modified lithosphere.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectOver the last decade, improved geochronological constraints on the timing of ore formation and key tectonic events have revealed that many porphyry deposits that were previously assumed to be subduction-related are in fact broadly collision-related, some forming in back-arc settings in advance of collision, some during collision, and others during post-collisional processes such as orogenic collapse and/or delamination of subcontinental mantle lithosphere. While the formation of subduction-related porphyries is quite well understood, collisional metallogeny is more complex, and may involve a number of different processes or sources. These include melting of: orogenically thickened crust; previously subduction-modified lithosphere (including metasomatized mantle, underplated mafic rocks, or lower crustal arc plutons and cumulates); or upwelling asthenosphere (e.g., in response to delamination, slab breakoff, back-arc extension, or orogenic collapse).Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision -

ScienceDirectThe tectonic and topographic evolution of southeast Asia is attributed to the indentation of India into Eurasia, gravitational collapse of the uplifted terrains and the dynamics of the Sunda and other western Pacific subduction zones, but their relative contributions remain elusive. Here, we analyse 3D numerical geodynamic modelling results involving a collision-subduction system and show that vigorous asthenospheric flow due to differential along-strike slab kinematics may contribute to the surface strain and elevations at collision-subduction transition zones. We argue that protracted northward migration of the collisional front and Indian slab during south to south-westward rollback subduction along the Sunda margin might have produced a similar asthenospheric flow. This flow could have contributed to the southeast Asia extrusion tectonics and uplift of the terrains around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and protruding from southeast Tibet. Therefore, we suggest that the tectonics and topographic growth east and southeast of Tibet are controlled not only by crustal and lithospheric deformation but also by asthenospheric dynamics.On the influence of the asthenospheric flow on the tectonics and topography at a collision-subduction transition zones: Comparison with the eastern Tibetan margin -

It has been proposed that the subducted boundary between the Cocos and Rivera plates occurs beneath this region, as indicated by inland volcanic activity, a gap in tectonic tremor, and the Manzanillo Trough and Colima Graben, which are depressions thought to be associated with the splitting of the two plates after subduction. Data from 50 broadband stations that comprised the MARS seismic array, deployed from January 2006 to June 2007, were processed with the software program Antelope and its generalized source location algorithm, genloc, to detect and locate earthquakes within the network. Slab surface depth contours from the resulting catalog indicate a change in subduction trajectory between the Rivera and Cocos plates. The earthquake locations are spatially anti-correlated with tectonic tremor, supporting the idea that they represent different types of fault slip. Hypocentral patterns also reveal areas of more intense seismic activity (clusters) that appear to be associated with the 2003 and 1973 megathrust rupture regions. Seismicity concentrated inland of the 2003 rupture is consistent with slip on a shallowly dipping trajectory for the Rivera plate interface as opposed to crustal faulting in the overriding North American plate. A prominent cluster of seismicity within the suspected 1973 rupture zone appears to be a commonly active portion of the megathrust as it has been active during three previous deployments. We support these interpretations by determining focal mechanisms and detailed relocations of the largest events within the 1973 and inland 2003 clusters, which indicate primarily thrust mechanisms near the plate interface.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone -

In contrast, the high Cu concentrations and fO2 values of collision-related Cu porphyry magmas were indirectly derived from subduction modified magmas, and the large amount of water and other volatiles in these magmas were controlled in part by partial melting of amphibolite derived from arc basalts that were underplated beneath the lower crust, and in part by the contribution from the rising potassic and ultrapotassic magmas. Both subduction- and collision-related porphyries are enriched in potassium, and were associated with crustal thickening. Their high K2O contents were primarily as a result of the inheritance of enriched mantle components and/or mixing with contemporaneous ultrapotassic magmas.Geochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis -

ScienceDirectModels show that fundamental force balance of subduction depends on buoyancy.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThe mechanical strength of the oceanic lithospheres exerts a fundamental control on the dynamics and tectonics of convergent margins. Here, we use numerical models of coupled subducting-upper plates and mantle to investigate the impact of the subducting lithosphere properties on the parameters commonly measured at subduction zones. The models predict a correlation among parameters such as subducting and convergence velocities, slab dip and curvature, and stress coupling with the upper plates, such signature emerges in a dynamic system through the slab buoyancy. Similar trends are found when assessing the impact of laboratory-constrained non-linear rheologies uncertainties on the mechanical strength and mantle flow, although some features are more affected. When the role of upper plate thickness is tested, we find a positive correlation of upper plate subsidence and fore-arc topography with the buoyancy of the down-going plate. However, plasticity in the crust limits the development of topography, becoming increasingly relevant with thinner upper plates, so that no correlation can be established. Similar control is found on the width of the long-wavelength dynamic subsidence, due to flexure, which increases non-linearly with the upper plate thickness. The models constrain relations among parameters within the dynamic system driven that allow inferences on the observable parameters. The comparisons supports the idea that the subduction dynamics emerges as a global phenomenon in plate motions, bending and dynamic subsidence, yet Andean-type margin tectonics is best addressed in a regional context.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNow at: Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, Science Labs, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.Zagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectZagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectA slice-stack of blueschists preserved in Southern Iran Zagros suture zone.Zagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectThe record of transient underplating processes and HP duplex formation.Zagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectZagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectA frozen example of long-term subduction interface dynamics.Zagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectZagros blueschists: Episodic underplating and long-lived cooling of a subduction zone - ScienceDirectThis slice-stack represents a well-preserved field example (i) highlighting the existence of transient underplating processes juxtaposing pluri-kilometric tectonic slices along the subduction channel and (ii) imaging the discontinuous down-stepping of the active main subduction thrust with ongoing accretion.

Global averages of plate margin geometries, sediment thickness, plate age, and convergence rate are used to construct generic models of accretionary and erosive margins. Of these parameters, our analysis shows that the largest uncertainty in these models is the geotherm for the incoming oceanic plate. Despite these uncertainties, the subduction thrust of similarly aged accretionary margins is slightly warmer than erosive margins primarily due to the effect of sediment insulating the subduction thrust at accretionary margins. If the updip limit of seismicity is thermally controlled, warmer accretionary margins suggest shallower seismogenic updip limits, counter to the observation that erosional margins are more likely to generate tsunamigenic earthquakes. This discrepancy can be reconciled if frictional heat generation at erosive margins is larger than at accretionary margins.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins -

On the basis of melting experiments of hydrous peridotites, we further propose that most mantle-derived melts and thus U-series disequilibria should be mainly produced by melting in the hot zone of the mantle wedge, as controlled by thermal structure of the convergent margins. In order to produce enough short-lived nuclides, the timescales of mass transfer and magmatism in the subduction zone should at least range from a few to a few hundred millennia. Future studies on more lavas, numerical modelling, and partition coefficients of U-series nuclides will help for better application of U-series disequilibria into subduction zone magmatism.U-series disequilibria in subduction zone lavas: Inherited from subducted slabs or produced by mantle in-growth melting? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectA recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectThe Costa Rica margin, NW of Osa, appears to be composed of clastic sediments.A recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectFew structures within the Costa Rica margin are consistent with tectonic erosion.A recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectThe margin wedge is composed of fault-propagation folds with no deep normal faults.A recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectA recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectA recent phase of accretion along the southern Costa Rican subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectFlip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectTectonic convergence across the Mediterranean induces fragmentation into micro-plates.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectReversal of subduction polarity across the Phoenician basin.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectEastern Cyprus Arc subduction cessation shifts to North Levant margin re-activation.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectRare modern example for subduction nucleation across the northern Levant margin.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectFlip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageFlip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectUri Schattner is a senior lecturer in marine geosciences, co-founder and former head of the Moses Strauss Dept. of Marine Geosciences, head of SeisLab for seismic interpretation.

ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectOver the last decade, improved geochronological constraints on the timing of ore formation and key tectonic events have revealed that many porphyry deposits that were previously assumed to be subduction-related are in fact broadly collision-related, some forming in back-arc settings in advance of collision, some during collision, and others during post-collisional processes such as orogenic collapse and/or delamination of subcontinental mantle lithosphere. While the formation of subduction-related porphyries is quite well understood, collisional metallogeny is more complex, and may involve a number of different processes or sources. These include melting of: orogenically thickened crust; previously subduction-modified lithosphere (including metasomatized mantle, underplated mafic rocks, or lower crustal arc plutons and cumulates); or upwelling asthenosphere (e.g., in response to delamination, slab breakoff, back-arc extension, or orogenic collapse).Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectHigh interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectDetecting low amplitude deformation due to subduction coupling from InSAR data.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectCombining corrections for non-tectonic sources in InSAR (e.g. tides and troposphere).High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectGround deformation reveals high interseismic coupling in eastern Makran.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectInferring lateral variations of interseismic coupling.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectEvaluating potential for large subduction earthquakes and tsunami.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectEstimating the extent of interseismic coupling along subduction zone megathrusts is essential for quantitative assessments of seismic and tsunami hazards. Up to now, quantifying the seismogenic potential of the eastern Makran subduction zone at the northern edge of the Indian ocean has remained elusive due to a paucity of geodetic observations. Furthermore, non-tectonic processes obscure the signature of accumulating elastic strain. Historical earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 7 have been reported. In particular, the 1945 Mw 8.1 earthquake resulted in a significant tsunami that swept the shores of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. A quantitative estimate of elastic strain accumulation along the subduction plate boundary in eastern Makran is needed to confront previous indirect and contradictory conclusions about the seismic potential in the region. Here, we infer the distribution of interseismic coupling on the eastern Makran megathrust from time series of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images acquired between 2003 and 2010, applying a consistent series of corrections to extract the low amplitude, long wavelength deformation signal associated with elastic strain on the megathrust. We find high interseismic coupling (i.e. the megathrust does not slip and elastic strain accumulates) in the central section of eastern Makran, where the 1945 earthquake occurred, while lower coupling coincides spatially with the subduction of the Sonne Fault Zone. The inferred accumulation of elastic strain since the 1945 earthquake is consistent with the future occurrence of magnitude 7+ earthquakes and we cannot exclude the possibility of a multi-segment rupture (Mw 8+). However, the likelihood for such scenarios might be modulated by partitioning of plate convergence between slip on the megathrust and internal deformation of the overlying, actively deforming, accretionary wedge.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone -

This redox reaction might be coupled with the oxidation of reduced oceanic phases such as sulfides, and the formation of oxidized fluids (e.g. SOX, H2O, COX). At greater depths, the beginning of antigorite dehydration leads to an increase of Fe3+/FeTotal in relict antigorite, in agreement with the preferential partitioning of ferric iron into serpentine rather than into olivine.Evolution of Fe redox state in serpentine during subduction -

ScienceDirectThe tectonic and topographic evolution of southeast Asia is attributed to the indentation of India into Eurasia, gravitational collapse of the uplifted terrains and the dynamics of the Sunda and other western Pacific subduction zones, but their relative contributions remain elusive. Here, we analyse 3D numerical geodynamic modelling results involving a collision-subduction system and show that vigorous asthenospheric flow due to differential along-strike slab kinematics may contribute to the surface strain and elevations at collision-subduction transition zones. We argue that protracted northward migration of the collisional front and Indian slab during south to south-westward rollback subduction along the Sunda margin might have produced a similar asthenospheric flow. This flow could have contributed to the southeast Asia extrusion tectonics and uplift of the terrains around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and protruding from southeast Tibet. Therefore, we suggest that the tectonics and topographic growth east and southeast of Tibet are controlled not only by crustal and lithospheric deformation but also by asthenospheric dynamics.On the influence of the asthenospheric flow on the tectonics and topography at a collision-subduction transition zones: Comparison with the eastern Tibetan margin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectGeochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectThe degassing systems are studied in context of the Indian continental subduction.Geochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectEnriched mantle wedge (EMW) is proposed as source of the mantle contributions.Geochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectThe EMW-derived volatiles are contaminated by regional crustal rock assemblages.Geochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectTectonic affinities of degassing systems are revealed by volatile geochemistry.Geochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectGeochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (235KB)Download full-size imageGeochemical constraints on origin of hydrothermal volatiles from southern Tibet and the Himalayas: Understanding the degassing systems in the India-Asia continental subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectSINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectDipping sub-Moho reflections are imaged beneath Sichuan Basin from SINOPROBE.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectThe sub-Moho reflections are interpreted as relict subduction.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectRelict subduction is Neo-Proterozoic age given nearby geochemical evidence.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectDebate about South China tectonic accretion may be solved by this study.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectPresence and preservation of fossil subduction shows strength of Sichuan lithosphere.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectA new multichannel seismic reflection profile collected across the Sichuan Basin in southern China by SINOPROBE images prominent reflectors that originate within the lower crust and penetrate well into the underlying mantle. The geometry of these mantle reflectors is very similar to those observed on other deep reflection profiles that have been interpreted as relicts of ancient subduction. Considering the geological history of the basement beneath and surrounding Sichuan Basin and ages of granites encountered in nearby wells, we propose that these newly revealed reflectors are the remnants of Neo-Proterozoic subduction that occurred along the NW margin of the Yangtze Craton. This interpretation is consistent with geochemical studies from a gneissic complex at the west margin of the Sichuan Basin. Moreover, preservation of these reflectors supports the idea that the Sichuan lithosphere served as a consolidated tectonic buttress against which the Tibetan Plateau has impinged to produce the Longmenshan orogenic belt.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectPreviously at Cornell University, United States.The redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectElements that can occur in more than one valence state, such as Fe, C and S, play an important role in Earth's systems at all levels, and can drive planetary evolution as they cycle through the various geochemical reservoirs. Subduction introduces oxidised Fe, C and S in sediments, altered ocean crust, and partially serpentinised lithospheric mantle to the relatively reduced mantle, with short- and long-term consequences for the redox state of the mantle. The distribution of redox-sensitive elements in the mantle controls the redox state of mantle-derived material added to the lithosphere and atmosphere, such as arc volcanic gases and the magmas that form arc-related ore deposits.The redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThus, inputs into subduction zones for Fe, C, S and redox budget are in excess of subduction zone outputs. If MORB and plume-related fluxes are taken into account then Fe, C and S fluxes balance, within error. However, the redox budget does not balance, unless the very lowest estimates for the extent of slab oxidation are taken. Thus it is likely that subduction continuously increases the redox budget of the mantle, that is, there is addition of Fe, C and S that are oxidised relative to the Fe, C and S in the mantle.The redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Strain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectStrain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectMafic amphibolite shear bands within the base of the New Caledonia ophioliteStrain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectRecord of successive metasomatism stages in the mantle wedgeStrain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectFluids flows controlled by high-temperature deformation during subduction initiationStrain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectStrain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectStrain localization and fluid infiltration in the mantle wedge during subduction initiation: Evidence from the base of the New Caledonia ophiolite - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectShallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThis study characterizes subduction related seismicity using the MARS deployment.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThrust mechanisms inland of the 2003 rupture zone suggest a shallow Rivera plate.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectSlab surface contours outline the inland extent of the shallow Rivera plate.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectSeismicity is spatially anti-correlated with non-volcanic tremor.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectInterplate seismicity in the proposed 1973 rupture zone appears to be persistent.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThis study characterizes subduction related seismicity with local deployments along the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone where 4 portions of the plate interface have ruptured in 1973, 1985, 1995, and 2003. It has been proposed that the subducted boundary between the Cocos and Rivera plates occurs beneath this region, as indicated by inland volcanic activity, a gap in tectonic tremor, and the Manzanillo Trough and Colima Graben, which are depressions thought to be associated with the splitting of the two plates after subduction. Data from 50 broadband stations that comprised the MARS seismic array, deployed from January 2006 to June 2007, were processed with the software program Antelope and its generalized source location algorithm, genloc, to detect and locate earthquakes within the network. Slab surface depth contours from the resulting catalog indicate a change in subduction trajectory between the Rivera and Cocos plates. The earthquake locations are spatially anti-correlated with tectonic tremor, supporting the idea that they represent different types of fault slip. Hypocentral patterns also reveal areas of more intense seismic activity (clusters) that appear to be associated with the 2003 and 1973 megathrust rupture regions. Seismicity concentrated inland of the 2003 rupture is consistent with slip on a shallowly dipping trajectory for the Rivera plate interface as opposed to crustal faulting in the overriding North American plate. A prominent cluster of seismicity within the suspected 1973 rupture zone appears to be a commonly active portion of the megathrust as it has been active during three previous deployments. We support these interpretations by determining focal mechanisms and detailed relocations of the largest events within the 1973 and inland 2003 clusters, which indicate primarily thrust mechanisms near the plate interface.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone -

ScienceDirectGeochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis - ScienceDirectIn subduction-related Cu porphyry magmas, the oxidation state (fO2), the concentrations of chalcophile metals, and other volatiles (e.g., S and Cl), and the abundance of water were directly controlled by the composition of the primary arc basaltic magma. In contrast, the high Cu concentrations and fO2 values of collision-related Cu porphyry magmas were indirectly derived from subduction modified magmas, and the large amount of water and other volatiles in these magmas were controlled in part by partial melting of amphibolite derived from arc basalts that were underplated beneath the lower crust, and in part by the contribution from the rising potassic and ultrapotassic magmas. Both subduction- and collision-related porphyries are enriched in potassium, and were associated with crustal thickening. Their high K2O contents were primarily as a result of the inheritance of enriched mantle components and/or mixing with contemporaneous ultrapotassic magmas.Geochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis -

ScienceDirectThe Okinawa Trough is an infant back-arc basin developed along the Ryukyu arc. This paper provides new major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Li isotope data of volcanic rocks in the Okinawa Trough and combines the published geochemical data to discuss the composition of magma source, the influence of subduction component, and the contamination of crustal materials, and calculate the contribution between subduction sediment and altered oceanic crust in the subduction component. The results showed that there are 97% DM and 3% EMI component in the mantle source in middle trough (MS), which have been influenced by subduction sediment. The Li-Nd isotopes indicate that the contribution of subduction sediment and altered oceanic crust in subduction component are 4 and 96%, respectively. The intermediate-acidic rocks suffer from contamination of continental crust material in shallow magma chamber during fractional crystallization. The acidic rocks in south trough have experienced more contamination of crustal material than those from the middle and north trough segments.Geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb-Li isotopic characteristics of volcanic rocks from the Okinawa Trough: Implications for the influence of subduction components and the contamination of crustal materials - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Constraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectConstraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectSubduction zone guided wave dispersion is observed in Northern Chile.Constraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectGuided wave dispersion is explained by hydrated faults and metastable oceanic crust.Constraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectObservations suggest that low velocity structure persists to at least 220 km depth.Constraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectMajority of WBZ earthquakes occur close to low velocity structure in the slab.Constraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectLarge amounts of water may be delivered to the mantle by young subducting plates.Constraining the hydration of the subducting Nazca plate beneath Northern Chile using subduction zone guided waves - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectThree MBL volcanoes display Ba and Nd isotope anomalies unique to West Antarctica.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectNeither lithospheric contamination, nor mantle amphibole explains the anomalies.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectResidual subduction component contamination provides the best explanation.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe anomaly source is a fossil mantle diapir attached to the base of the lithosphere.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe apparent coincidence of these anomalies with the site of a pre-Cenozoic convergence zone along the Gondwanaland margin suggests a subduction influence.

ScienceDirectTearing of the subducting Indian slab and upwelling of the hot asthenospheric mantleComplex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectOn the eastern margin of the Himalayan orogenic belt, the rapid uplift of the Namche Barwa metamorphic terrane and significant bending of the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone occur. The formation mechanism and dynamics of the Eastern Himalaya Syntaxis (EHS) is still debated. In order to better understand the deep structures beneath the EHS, we deployed 35 broadband seismic stations around the Namche Barwa Mountain. The data were integrated with existing datasets for a 3-D teleseismic P-wave tomography. The results demonstrate complex deep structures and significantly contrasting Indian subduction styles in the eastern Himalaya. In the western region of the EHS, the Indian slab flatly subducts under southern Tibet and might extend to the Bangong-Nujiang Suture. In contrast, a (north)eastward steep subduction occurred in the eastern region of EHS. The contrasting subduction styles result in tearing and fragmentation of the Indian lithosphere between the flat and steep subducting slabs beneath the EHS. Consequently, the hot asthenospheric mantle may rise through the slab window, which might further lead to the rapid uplift of Namche Barwa and the formation of EHS. The lateral variation in subduction/collision mode and slab tearing induced asthenospheric mantle upwelling is similar to that observed in the Hellenide and Anatolide domains of the Tethyan orogen.Complex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (166KB)Download full-size imageComplex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Trench dynamics: Effects of dynamically migrating trench on subducting slab morphology and characteristics of subduction zones systems - ScienceDirectTrench dynamics: Effects of dynamically migrating trench on subducting slab morphology and characteristics of subduction zones systems - ScienceDirectNumerical studies of plate subduction with a free trench migration is performed.Trench dynamics: Effects of dynamically migrating trench on subducting slab morphology and characteristics of subduction zones systems - ScienceDirectThe result suggests that trench retreat is dynamically self-consistent phenomenon.Trench dynamics: Effects of dynamically migrating trench on subducting slab morphology and characteristics of subduction zones systems - ScienceDirectStrong lateral mantle flow from a sub-horizontal slab enhances the trench retreat.Trench dynamics: Effects of dynamically migrating trench on subducting slab morphology and characteristics of subduction zones systems - ScienceDirectTrench dynamics: Effects of dynamically migrating trench on subducting slab morphology and characteristics of subduction zones systems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectA Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectA Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal is proposed in the North China Craton.A Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectA Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectThese granites have A-type characteristics.A Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectA Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectA Neoarchean subduction polarity reversal event in the North China Craton - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fluid-mobile elements in serpentinites: Constraints on serpentinisation environments and element cycling in subduction zones - ScienceDirectFluid-mobile element (FME) systematics in serpentinites are key to unravel the environments of mantle rock hydration, dehydration, and element recycling in subduction zones. Here we compile serpentinite geochemical data and, for the first time, report discriminative FME enrichment trends for mid ocean ridge vs. forearc serpentinisation by applying alkali element-U ratios. Characteristic element fractionations are thereby governed by redox-dependent differential U mobility at mid ocean ridges and in forearcs, and by high Cs input in forearcs due to fluids equilibrated with sediments. Simple modelling reproduces the observed enrichment trends in serpentinites that range over several orders of magnitude. From these systematics, first constraints on potentially discriminative fractionation trends for unconventional fluid tracers such as B, As, and Sb can be deduced. Prominent W enrichments that correlate with FMEs suggest significant W mobility in low-temperature serpentinising environments.Fluid-mobile elements in serpentinites: Constraints on serpentinisation environments and element cycling in subduction zones -

Tremors in the overriding continental crust of several subduction zones suggest fluid circulation at shallower depths, but potential fluid pathways are still poorly documented. Using receiver function analysis in the Cascadia subduction zone, we provide evidence for a seismic discontinuity near 15 km depth in the crust of the overriding North American plate. This interface is segmented, and its interruptions are spatially correlated with conductive regions of the forearc and shallow swarms of seismicity and non-volcanic tremors. These observations suggest that fluid circulation in the overriding plate is controlled by fault zones separating blocks of accreted terranes. These zones constitute fluid escape routes that may influence the seismic cycle by releasing fluid pressure from the megathrust.Deep crustal fracture zones control fluid escape and the seismic cycle in the Cascadia subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirectInfluence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirectDynamic topography induced by the Peruvian flat-slab morphology investigated.Influence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirect>1km of dynamic subsidence predicted at subduction leading edge (>1000km from trench).Influence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirectExplains widespread subsidence episode and thick distal foreland deposits.Influence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirectAmazonian landscape and drainage evolution shaped by dynamics of flat subduction.Influence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirectInfluence of Peruvian flat-subduction dynamics on the evolution of western Amazonia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectThe behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectGeochemical variations of trace elements (REE, Zr, Hf) have been attributed to subduction processes and arc maturity.The behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectChondrite normalized REE pattern, Zr-Hf and (Zr/Hf)-Hf scatter plots can be used as a tool to recognize the fertile and/or mineralized magmatic suites in magmatic arcs.The behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectThe geochemistry of trace elements have been attributed to:- Subduction processes- Arc maturity- Recognition of mineralized bodiesThe behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectThe behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageThe behavior of rare-earth elements, zirconium and hafnium during magma evolution and their application in determining mineralized magmatic suites in subduction zones: Constraints from the Cenozoic belts of Iran - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the North Qinling Orogenic Belt in Central China: Insights on continental deep subduction and multiphase exhumation - ScienceDirectEarly Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the North Qinling Orogenic Belt in Central China: Insights on continental deep subduction and multiphase exhumation - ScienceDirectEarly Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the North Qinling Orogenic Belt in Central China: Insights on continental deep subduction and multiphase exhumation - ScienceDirectNew evidence suggests that the Qinling Complex is a tectonic complex rather than a uniform stratigraphic unit or a microcontinent as previously believed, and is mainly composed of the exhumed HP-UHP metamorphic rocks, deep subduction- exhumation-related magmatic rocks and the early Neoproterozoic granites together with the host rocks from the over-riding plate at an active continental margin.

ScienceDirectThe complex feedback between dehydration and melting in hot subduction zones is quantitatively addressed in this study. We present an integrated numerical tool that combines a high-resolution thermo-mechanical subduction model with a thermodynamic database that allows modeling metamorphic devolatilization, and subsequent re-hydration and melting reactions. We apply this tool to quantify how the hydration state of a lithologically layered subducting slab varies during interaction with the hot mantle wedge and how this affects any melting taking place in the subducting crust or the overlying mantle wedge. Total crustal dehydration is achieved before any crustal melting can occur, even in very young subducting slabs. Significant oceanic crust melting is only achieved if the metamorphic fluids from the dehydrating underlying subducting slab mantle are fluxed through the dry eclogites. But our models further demonstrate that even if the oceanic crust can melt in these specific conditions, the preceding crustal dehydration will simultaneously result in extensive mantle wedge melting at lower pressures than for colder slabs. The significant mantle wedge melting implies that also for hot subduction zones, most of the melt feeding the overriding plate is of mantle origin.Eclogite-, amphibolite- and blueschist-facies rocks from Diego de Almagro Island (Patagonia): Episodic accretion and thermal evolution of the Chilean subduction interface during the Cretaceous - ScienceDirectEclogite-, amphibolite- and blueschist-facies rocks from Diego de Almagro Island (Patagonia): Episodic accretion and thermal evolution of the Chilean subduction interface during the Cretaceous - ScienceDirectEclogite-, amphibolite- and blueschist-facies rocks from Diego de Almagro Island (Patagonia): Episodic accretion and thermal evolution of the Chilean subduction interface during the Cretaceous - ScienceDirectEclogite-, amphibolite- and blueschist-facies rocks from Diego de Almagro Island (Patagonia): Episodic accretion and thermal evolution of the Chilean subduction interface during the Cretaceous - ScienceDirectHP rocks record the Cretaceous thermal evolution of S.

For example, the buoyancy of high bathymetric relief is thought to flatten the dip of the subducting slab, modifying the structural and magmatic evolution of the overriding plate and terminating arc volcanism. In addition, the effect of ridge subduction in retreating plate boundaries can inhibit subduction rollback, a process that could locally pin the subduction hinge and lead to the development of cusps and slab tearing. Here we discuss the tectonic response to subduction of high bathymetric relief using examples from the circum-Pacific subduction systems. We demonstrate that flattening of the subduction dip angle is only significant in the eastern Pacific, where the average slab dip angle is relatively shallow. In the western Pacific, in contrast, the average subduction dip angle is steeper and there is no significant flattening of the dip angle in areas of ridge subduction. Subduction of high bathymetric relief in the circum-Pacific is commonly associated with reduced arc volcanism, and in many cases, the area of ridge subduction coincides with a volcanic gap. In the overriding plate, ridge subduction is associated with pronounced changes in the style of deformation, involving uplift, reactivation of basement thrusts, development of orogen-perpendicular tear faults and block rotations leading to oroclinal bending. The discussed characteristic patterns associated with ridge subduction provide important guidelines for reconstructing past plate tectonic processes, and could help constraining the geodynamics of ancient subduction systems.Tectonic and magmatic responses to the subduction of high bathymetric relief - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageTectonic and magmatic responses to the subduction of high bathymetric relief - ScienceDirectTectonic and magmatic responses to the subduction of high bathymetric relief - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectMantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectMantle wedge flow and the thermal structure in Tohoku are nearly two-dimensional.Mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectOblique subduction in Hokkaido leads to 3-D mantle flow with northerly inflow.Mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectConvergence of mantle inflow from Hokkaido and Tohoku results in a cold wedge.Mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectThe cold wedge in Hokkaido and Tohoku correlates with the arc location.Mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectMantle inflow is sub-parallel to volcanic cross-chain orientations.Mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectMantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure in Northeast Japan: Effects of oblique subduction and 3-D slab geometry - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Molybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMo enrichment in the arc lavas is caused by fluids derived from the subducted slab.Molybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectThe fate of crustal material recycled into the convecting mantle by plate tectonics is important for understanding the chemical and physical evolution of the planet. Marked isotopic variability of Mo at the Earth's surface offers the promise of providing distinctive signatures of such recycled material. However, characterisation of the behaviour of Mo during subduction is needed to assess the potential of Mo isotope ratios as tracers for global geochemical cycles. Here we present Mo isotope data for input and output components of the archetypical Mariana arc: Mariana arc lavas, sediments from ODP Sites 800, 801 and 802 near the Mariana trench and the altered mafic, oceanic crust (AOC), from ODP Site 801, together with samples of the deeper oceanic crust from ODP Site 1256. We also report new high precision Pb isotope data for the Mariana arc lavas and a dataset of Pb isotope ratios from sediments from ODP Sites 800, 801 and 802. The Mariana arc lavas are enriched in Mo compared to elements of similar incompatibility during upper mantle melting, and have distinct, isotopically heavy Mo (high 98Mo/95Mo) relative to the upper mantle, by up to 0.3 parts per thousand. In contrast, the various subducting sediment lithologies dominantly host isotopically light Mo. Coupled Pb and Mo enrichment in the Mariana arc lavas suggests a common source for these elements and we further use Pb isotopes to identify the origin of the isotopically heavy Mo. We infer that an aqueous fluid component with elevated [Mo], [Pb], high 98Mo/95Mo and unradiogenic Pb is derived from the subducting, mafic oceanic crust. Although the top few hundred metres of the subducting, mafic crust have a high 98Mo/95Mo, as a result of seawater alteration, tightly defined Pb isotope arrays of the Mariana arc lavas extrapolate to a fluid component akin to fresh Pacific mid-ocean ridge basalts. This argues against a flux dominantly derived from the highly altered, uppermost mafic crust or indeed from an Indian-like mantle wedge. Thus we infer that the Pb and Mo budgets of the fluid component are dominated by contributions from the deeper, less altered (cooler) portion of the subducting Pacific crust. The high 98Mo/95Mo of this flux is likely caused by isotopic fractionation during dehydration and fluid flow in the slab. As a result, the residual mafic crust becomes isotopically lighter than the upper mantle from which it was derived. Our results suggest that the continental crust produced by arc magmatism should have an isotopically heavy Mo composition compared to the mantle, whilst a contribution of deep recycled oceanic crust to the sources of some ocean island basalts might be evident from an isotopically light Mo signature.Molybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectIn natural subduction zones, subduction erosion may initially occur through steady erosion at the edge of the continental plate. As material is removed, the subduction angle may gradually decrease, increasing the strength of the plate boundary zone. The increased strength may lead to failure in the continental interior, unsteady removal of a large forearc block and relocation of the subduction zone into the upper plate where the cycle may repeat. The proposed cycle may explain observed patterns in the Andean margin, including steady and unsteady erosion recorded in the geological record and along-strike variation in present-day subduction angles.Subduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record -

The observation of fast shear-wave velocities parallel to the trench in such settings has been inferred to represent trench-parallel mantle flow beneath a retreating slab. Here, we investigate this process by measuring seismic anisotropy in the shallow Aegean mantle. We carry out shear-wave splitting analysis on a dense array of seismometers across the Western Hellenic Subduction Zone, and find a pronounced zonation of anisotropy at the scale of the subduction zone. Fast SKS splitting directions subparallel to the trench-retreat direction dominate the region nearest to the trench. Fast splitting directions abruptly transition to trench-parallel above the corner of the mantle wedge, and rotate back to trench-normal over the back-arc. We argue that the trench-normal anisotropy near the trench is explained by entrainment of an asthenospheric layer beneath the shallow-dipping portion of the slab. Toward the volcanic arc this signature is overprinted by trench-parallel anisotropy in the mantle wedge, likely caused by a layer of strained serpentine immediately above the slab. Arcward steepening of the slab and horizontal divergence of mantle flow due to rollback may generate an additional component of sub-slab trench-parallel anisotropy in this region. Poloidal flow above the retreating slab is likely the dominant source of back-arc trench-normal anisotropy. We hypothesize that trench-normal anisotropy associated with significant entrainment of the asthenospheric mantle near the trench may be widespread but only observable at shallow-dipping subduction zones where stations nearest the trench do not overlie the mantle wedge.Pronounced zonation of seismic anisotropy in the Western Hellenic subduction zone and its geodynamic significance -

ScienceDirectThe degree of serpentinization is approximately 18%.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectSerpentinized peridotite in the fore-arc has been observed in a number of subduction zones, including the northern Manila subduction zone which terminates northward in the Taiwan arc-continent collision. How this zone of serpentinization changes northward from the subduction of thinned continental lithosphere to full arc-continent collision in the Taiwan orogeny is not well known. In this paper we present 2-D gravity modeling along three P-wave (Vp) transects across the Taiwan orogeny. Two of these transects were collected with ocean-bottom seismometers. These two transects provide good constraints on the velocity structure to the west of, and on land, southern Taiwan. Conversion of Vp to density in this area allows us to model the gravity anomaly with very little misfit. Along the subduction zone, however, the velocity models are poorly constrained in the upper mantle, where an anomalous density unit has to be used in order to model the short wavelength gravity anomaly in this area. A third transect across central Taiwan that is derived from the TAIGER local tomography data, provides good control on the crust and upper mantle Vp structure that we use to place provide density constraints for modeling the gravity anomaly in this part of the collision zone. In order to model the short wavelength gravity anomaly across the Longitudinal Valley and the southern Longitudinal trough, an anomalous density block is required beneath the fore-arc region. We interpret that the source of this anomalous density material could be serpentinized fore-arc mantle, similar to what is interpreted for the northern Manila subduction zone farther south. Water released from the subduction of the extended crust of the continental margin results in the serpentinization of the fore-arc area and may be driving the uplifting of the high-pressure rocks.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectThe subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectThe Mugagangri Group is explained as a southward-facing accretionary complex.The subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectThe Shamuluo Formation was deposited in a residual-sea or trench-slope basin.The subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectThe subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectThe subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectThe Mesozoic strata, within the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone in central Tibet, recorded critical information about the subduction-accretion processes of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean prior to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. This paper reports detailed field observations, petrographic descriptions, sandstone detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic analyses from an accretionary complex (preserved as Mugagangri Group) and the unconformably overlying Shamuluo Formation near Gaize. The youngest detrital zircon ages, together with other age constraints from literature, suggest that the Mugagangri Group was deposited during late Triassic-early Jurassic, while the Shamuluo Formation was deposited during late Jurassic-early Cretaceous. Based on the differences in lithology, age and provenance, the Mugagangri Group is subdivided into the upper, middle and lower subunits. These units are younging structurally downward/southward, consistent with models of progressive off-scrapping and accretion in a southward-facing subduction complex. The upper subunit, comprising mainly quartz-sandstone and siliceous mud/shale, was deposited in abyssal plain environment close to the Qiangtang passive margin during late Triassic, with sediments derived from the southern Qiangtang block. The middle and lower subunits comprise mainly lithic-quartz-sandstone and mud/shale, containing abundant ultramafic/ophiolitic fragments. The middle subunit, of late Triassic-early Jurassic age, records a transition in tectono-depositional setting from abyssal plain to trench-wedge basin, with sudden influx of sediments sourced from the central Qiangtang metamorphic belt and northern Qiangtang magmatic belt. The appearance of ultramafic/ophiolitic fragments in the middle subunit reflects the subduction initiation. The lower subunit was deposited in a trench-wedge basin during early Jurassic, with influx of Jurassic-aged zircons originating from the newly active southern Qiangtang magmatic arc. The lower subunit records the onset of arc magmatism related to the northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean. The Shamuluo Formation, comprising mainly lithic-feldspar-sandstone with limestone interlayers, was deposited in a post-collisional residual-sea or pre-collisional trench-slope basin, with sediments derived entirely from the Qiangtang block.The subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Does subduction polarity changes below the Alps? Inferences from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectThe surface expression of a lateral polarity change of continental mantle lithosphere subduction has been studied by using lithosphere-scale physical models. Key parameters investigated were: the degree of lateral coupling between adjacent domains of opposing subduction polarity, the width of the zone separating the domains, and the lithosphere geometry and rheology. The model results illustrate an asymmetric lithospheric structure induced by deformation of the downgoing plates, which have been separated by a narrow transition zone. A wide and symmetric orogenic wedge overlying a region of thickened mantle lithosphere and hampered subduction characterizes this transition zone. In addition, interaction between the neighboring subduction domains caused downbending of the upper plates and resulted in the lateral termination of crustal structures and lowering of surface topography. The lateral extent of interaction between the domains strongly depends on the degree of coupling between the domains, the rheology of the mantle lithosphere and the amount of bulk shortening. The modelling results have major implications on the interpretation of seismic and tomographic data from the European Alps in terms of the crust and lithosphere geometries. It appears that an observed lateral change of subduction polarity at mantle depth can explain the variations of wedge build-up between the Western/Central and Eastern Alps.Does subduction polarity changes below the Alps?

ScienceDirectResidual phengite and fluids control the release of thallium to the arc surface.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America - ScienceDirectSediment is actively being subducted in every convergent margin worldwide. Yet, geochemical data for arc lavas from several subduction zones, such as Northern Tonga and Costa Rica have revealed either attenuated or limited evidence for sediment in their mantle source regions. Here we use thallium (Tl) isotopes to trace slab components in lavas from the Tonga-Kermadec and Central American arcs. In general, both arcs display Tl isotope data that are most compatible with addition of sediment to the sub-arc mantle from the subducting slab. This evidence is particular strong in the Tonga-Kermadec arc where pelagic clays dominate the Tl budget along the entire arc. Contributions from altered oceanic crust as well as the Louisville Seamount chain that subducts underneath Northern Tonga are not visible in Tl isotopes, which is likely due to the very high Tl concentrations found in pelagic sediments outboard of the Tonga-Kermadec arc. Lavas from Central America reveal variable and systematic Tl isotope compositions along-strike. In particular, lavas from Nicaragua are dominated by contributions from sediments, whereas Costa Rican samples reveal a significant altered oceanic crust component with little influence from sediments on thallium isotope composition. The absence of a sediment signature in Costa Rica corresponds with the Cocos Ridge and the seamount province subduction, which results in a thinner sediment cover. Furthermore, the subducted sediment is dominated by carbonates with very low Tl concentrations and, therefore, small amounts of carbonate sediment added to the mantle wedge do not contribute significantly to the overall Tl budget.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America - ScienceDirectA review of Tl isotope and concentration data from the Aleutians, Marianas, Tonga-Kermadec and Central American arcs demonstrate that pelagic sediments are detectable in most arcs, whereas altered oceanic crust components only become appreciable when sediment Tl concentrations are very low (e.g. carbonate) or if sediments are no longer a significant component of the subducting slab (e.g. slab melting in Western Aleutians). As such, Tl isotopes are a promising tool to trace sediment subduction although this requires at least some pelagic sediment is present in the subducted sediment package.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America - ScienceDirectWe suggest that thallium partitioning between the slab and mantle wedge is most likely controlled by retention in phengite or by partitioning into fluids. Residual phengite likely produces high Cs/Tl ratios because Tl should be more compatible in phengite than is Cs, however, this conclusion needs experimental verification. The stability of phengite is lower at higher fluid contents, which results in hyperbolic relationships between Cs/Tl and possible indicators of fluids such as Sr/Nd and Ba/Th. Thus, combined Tl isotopic and elemental systematics not only provide detailed information about the specific slab components that contribute to arc lavas, but also potentially shed light on the mineralogy and physical conditions of subducting slabs.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America -

ScienceDirectThe kinematics of subduction zones shows a variety of settings that can provide clues for dynamic understandings. Two reference frames are used here to describe the simple 2D kinematics of subduction zones. In the first, the upper plate is assumed fixed, whereas in the second frame upper and lower plates move relative to the mantle.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectCombining the different movements, at least 14 kinematic settings can be distinguished along the subduction zones. Variable settings can coexist even along a single subduction zone, as shown for the 5 different cases occurring along the Apennines subduction zone. Apart from few exceptions, the subduction hinge converges toward the upper plate more frequently along E- or NE-directed subduction zone, whereas it mainly diverges from the upper plate along W-directed subduction zones accompanying backarc extension.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectBackarc spreading forms in two settings: along the W-directed subduction zones it is determined by the hinge divergence relative to the upper plate, minus the volume of the accretionary prism, or, in case of scarce or no accretion, minus the volume of the asthenospheric intrusion at the subduction hinge. Since the volume of the accretionary prism is proportional to the depth of the decollement plane, the backarc rifting is inversely proportional to the depth of the decollement. On the other hand, along E- or NE-directed subduction zones, few backarc basins form (e.g., Aegean, Andaman) and can be explained by the velocity gradient within the hangingwall lithosphere, separated into two plates.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectThis kinematic observation casts serious doubts on the slab negative buoyancy as the primary driving mechanism of subduction and plate motions.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectAll this indicates that subduction zones have different origin as a function of their geographic polarity, and the subduction process is more a passive feature rather than being the driving mechanism of plate motions.

ScienceDirectMost granitoids are crustal melts Some granites are mantle-derived, but have isotopic properties controlled by small amounts of crustal recycling to the mantle.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectLate-collision sites are significant for crustal growth; although less efficient than subductions, they are better preserved.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectSites similar to late collision may be a realistic alternative to supra-subduction arcs for Archaean crustal growth.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectEarth's continental crust is dominantly made of buoyant, felsic igneous material (granitoids), that was ultimately extracted from the mantle as a result of Earth's differentiation. Since felsic melts are not in chemical equilibrium with the mantle, they can originate either from melting of older crustal lithologies, or from differentiation of a primitive mantle melt; only the latter case will contribute to crustal growth. To understand the mechanisms of continental crust growth and differentiation through time, it is therefore necessary to unravel the respective contribution of these two different mechanisms in the genesis of granitoid suites. In modern Earth, granitoids are chiefly generated in convergent plate boundaries (subduction and collision). This paper examines the granitic suites in a late-collision environment, the Variscan French Massif Central (FMC), and compares them with the suites found in an oceanic arc. We therefore describe, and compare, two end-members sites of granite generation.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectIn the FMC, several main types of granites are described. Muscovite and Cordierite bearing Peraluminous Granites (resp. MPG and CPG) contain large amounts of inherited zircons, and their chemistry demonstrates that their sources were older crustal material (resp. metasediments and metaigneous). On the other hand, Potassic Calc-alkaline Granites (KCG), associated to potassic diorites (vaugnerites) do not contain inherited zircons, and ultimately derive from the vaugnerites. The vaugnerites in turn form by partial melting of a mantle contaminated by the regional crust. Therefore, although they are isotopically similar to the crust, the KCG are net contributors to crustal growth. Thus we conclude that although late-orogenic settings are dominated by crustal melting and recycling, they may be sites of net crustal growth, even though this is not visible from isotopes only. In contrast, arc granitoids are purely or almost purely mantle derived. However, the preservation potential of arcs is much smaller than the preservation of late-orogenic domains, such that at the scale of a whole orogenic belt, late-orogenic magmatism is probably as important as arc magmatism.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectFinally, we speculate that the situation may have been similar in the Archaean, or even more skewed towards late-orogenic sites (or similar environments, dominated by melting of an altered mafic protocrust), owing to the hotter mantle and less stable subductions during that period.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectSubduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectSubduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectThe Cuaba subcomplex includes diverse arc-like mafic protoliths.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectIt contains fragments of its supra-subduction zone mantle.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectIt represents part of the subducted fore-arc of the Caribbean island-arc.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectThe Rio San Juan metamorphic complex (RSJC) exposes a segment of a high-P accretionary prism, built during Late Cretaceous subduction below the intra-oceanic Caribbean island-arc.

The process by which new subduction zones initiate, however, remains poorly understood. Several different mechanisms for subduction initiation have been proposed, including passive margin collapse (aided by sediment loading and/or rheological weakening due to the presence of volatiles) and forced convergence across a zone of preexisting lithospheric weakness. In this paper we focus on the latter type of model, which identifies three conditions necessary for subduction initiation: a zone of weakness such as a fracture zone, an age (and therefore density) offset along the fracture zone, and significant normal compressive stress which leads to shortening. We identify regions on the present-day Earth which meet these conditions and which may correspond to regions of relatively likely subduction initiation in the near future. Using a digital seafloor age model, we have created a database of oceanic fractures and quantified the associated age offsets. We have evaluated the state of stress on these lithospheric weak zones using two different global stress models. We find that the conditions needed to initiate subduction via the forced convergence model are relatively rare on the present-day Earth, and that there is little indication of incipient subduction at regions identified as relatively likely for subduction initiation. Using the same technique, we have evaluated the state of stress and seafloor age offset at regions of inferred present-day incipient subduction, and find that most of these regions are not associated with both high far-field compressive stresses and large age (and thus density) offsets. Subduction has likely initiated via forced convergence across preexisting zones of lithospheric weakness in the past, but our results indicate that the conditions needed for this type of subduction initiation are rare on the present-day Earth.State of stress and age offsets at oceanic fracture zones and implications for the initiation of subduction -

The intrusion also exhibits an adakitic signature (high Sr, low Y and HREE contents) suggesting that Ordovician magmatism also occurred within the Indochina Terrane, associated with an enigmatic, early Gondwana subduction event. This intrusion appears part of a broader, bilateral Early Ordovician magmatism, newly linked to the south-east subduction of the Tamky-Phuoc Son Ocean underneath the Kontum terrane, and a north-west subduction beneath the Truong Son terrane. Significantly, sub-economic hydrothermal Cu mineralisation observed within the dioritic intrusion, hints at the presence of local Ordovician, porphyry-style base metal enrichment.Evidence for Ordovician subduction-related magmatism in the Truong Son terrane, SE Laos: Implications for Gondwana evolution and porphyry Cu exploration potential in SE Asia - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (100KB)Download full-size imageEvidence for Ordovician subduction-related magmatism in the Truong Son terrane, SE Laos: Implications for Gondwana evolution and porphyry Cu exploration potential in SE Asia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigating slab edge kinematics through seismological data: The northern boundary of the Ionian subduction system (south Italy) - ScienceDirectInvestigating slab edge kinematics through seismological data: The northern boundary of the Ionian subduction system (south Italy) - ScienceDirectSeismic analyses characterize present kinematics of the Ionian slab northern edge.Investigating slab edge kinematics through seismological data: The northern boundary of the Ionian subduction system (south Italy) - ScienceDirectWe evidence seismological signatures of the continuous-slab edge.Investigating slab edge kinematics through seismological data: The northern boundary of the Ionian subduction system (south Italy) - ScienceDirectShallow signatures of STEP fault lateral migration at the slab edge are found.Investigating slab edge kinematics through seismological data: The northern boundary of the Ionian subduction system (south Italy) - ScienceDirectSeismic constraints to the modelling of the Ionian subduction system are furnished.Investigating slab edge kinematics through seismological data: The northern boundary of the Ionian subduction system (south Italy) - ScienceDirectAn integrated analysis of seismotomography models, earthquake spatial distribution and focal mechanism solutions has been performed in the still poorly constrained region marking the northern boundary of the Ionian subducting slab (south Italy). In this area, research findings related to the continuous- vs detached-slab transition are diffused on a wide sector running from central Calabria to the southern Apennines tip and different locations of a subduction-transform edge propagator (STEP) have also been proposed in the recent literature.

They show significant variability in terms of extension and shortening. We investigated numerically the physical controls of these processes using a 2D petrological-thermo-mechanical intra-oceanic subduction model with spontaneous volcanic arc growth and deformation. We varied the fluid- and melt-related weakening, the ages of both the subduction slab and the overriding plate, the subducting plate velocities, and the cohesive strength of rocks. Three main geodynamic regimes were identified: retreating subduction with opening of a backarc basin, stable subduction, and advancing, compressive subduction. The main difference between these regimes is the degree of rheological coupling between plates, which is governed by the intensity of rheological weakening induced by fluids and melts. Retreating subduction regimes require plate decoupling, which results from strong weakening due to both fluids and melts. Spreading centers nucleate either in forearc or in intraarc regions. Episodic trench migration is often due to variations of plate coupling with time, which is caused by (fore) arc deformation. Stable subduction regime with little variation in the trench position forms at an intermediate plate coupling and shows a transient behavior from the retreating to advancing modes. The advancing subduction regime results from strong plate coupling. At the mature stage, this subduction mode is associated with both partial fragmentation and subduction of the previously serpentinized forearc region. Forearc subduction is typically associated with a magmatic pulse, which is caused by dehydration of subducted serpentinized forearc fragments. Our models demonstrate distinct differences in thermal and lithological structure of subduction zones formed in these different geodynamic regimes. Results compare well with variations observed in natural intra-oceanic arcs.Geodynamic regimes of intra-oceanic subduction: Implications for arc extension vs. shortening processes - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageGeodynamic regimes of intra-oceanic subduction: Implications for arc extension vs. shortening processes - ScienceDirectGeodynamic regimes of intra-oceanic subduction: Implications for arc extension vs. shortening processes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction of oceanic asthenosphere: A critical appraisal in central Alaska - ScienceDirectSubduction of oceanic asthenosphere: A critical appraisal in central Alaska - ScienceDirectSubduction of oceanic asthenosphere: A critical appraisal in central Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectMid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectMid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectThe rocks were derived by mixing between mantle- and crust-derived magmas in continental arc setting.Mid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectThe youngest plutons were generated by mantle upwelling related to ridge subduction.Mid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectMid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (166KB)Download full-size imageMid-Neoproterozoic ridge subduction and magmatic evolution in the northeastern margin of the Indochina block: Evidence from geochronology and geochemistry of calc-alkaline plutons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectThe Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectCr-spinel from the Guleman chromitites shows a range of Cr# from 0.61 to 0.81.The Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectIPGE enrichment over PPGE implies crystallization from S-undersaturated mantle melts.The Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectThe PGM assemblage in these chromitites is dominated by Ru-Os bisulfides.The Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectParental melts of chromitites imply their genesis at varying degrees of melting of a common mantle source.The Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectThe Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectThe Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (166KB)Download full-size imageThe Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Guleman ophiolitic chromitites (SE Turkey) and their link to a compositionally evolving mantle source during subduction initiation - ScienceDirectPresent address: Ayiou Mina 31, 18900 Salamina, Greece.The onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectExcellent exposures of high-pressure rocks developed in a Variscan continental subduction system outcrop in NW Iberia. The kinematic criteria provided by the high-pressure metamorphic fabrics can be used to infer tectonic flow within the deep sections of this system. The dominant trend of the ductile flow is oblique to that of the orogenic belt, indicating oblique continental subduction. Its azimuth, a few tens of degrees clockwise relative to the orogenic trend, suggests dextral transpression between Gondwana and Laurussia during continental subduction that took place at the Upper Devonian, and provides a consistent kinematic reference for the earliest assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia.The onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageThe onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectThe onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mobility of tungsten in subduction zones - ScienceDirectMobility of tungsten in subduction zones - ScienceDirectCollectively, our data therefore suggest a selective enrichment of W relative to Th, U, and Ta in the sub-arc mantle via fluids derived from subducted oceanic crust. As subduction zone volcanism significantly contributes to the growth of continental crust, continued recycling of continental material into the sources of subduction zone magmas may have amplified the extent of W enrichment, possibly leading to a higher W/Th and W/U in the Earth's crust compared to the Earth's mantle.Mobility of tungsten in subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Teleseismic constraints on the geological environment of deep episodic slow earthquakes in subduction zone forearcs: A review - ScienceDirectMore than a decade after the discovery of deep episodic slow slip and tremor, or slow earthquakes, at subduction zones, much research has been carried out to investigate the structural and seismic properties of the environment in which they occur. Slow earthquakes generally occur on the megathrust fault some distance downdip of the great earthquake seismogenic zone in the vicinity of the mantle wedge corner, where three major structural elements are in contact: the subducting oceanic crust, the overriding forearc crust and the continental mantle. In this region, thermo-petrological models predict significant fluid production from the dehydrating oceanic crust and mantle due to prograde metamorphic reactions, and their consumption by hydrating the mantle wedge. These fluids are expected to affect the dynamic stability of the megathrust fault and enable slow slip by increasing pore-fluid pressure and/or reducing friction in fault gouges. Resolving the fine-scale structure of the deep megathrust fault and the in situ distribution of fluids where slow earthquakes occur is challenging, and most advances have been made using teleseismic scattering techniques (e.g., receiver functions). In this paper we review the teleseismic structure of six well-studied subduction zones (three hot, i.e., Cascadia, southwest Japan, central Mexico, and three cool, i.e., Costa Rica, Alaska, and Hikurangi) that exhibit slow earthquake processes and discuss the evidence of structural and geological controls on the slow earthquake behavior. We conclude that changes in the mechanical properties of geological materials downdip of the seismogenic zone play a dominant role in controlling slow earthquake behavior, and that near-lithostatic pore-fluid pressures near the megathrust fault may be a necessary but insufficient condition for their occurrence.Teleseismic constraints on the geological environment of deep episodic slow earthquakes in subduction zone forearcs: A review -

These two-dimensional thermal models provide insight to the dehydration and melting processes that occur in subduction zones. Despite the wide range of slab geometries, ages, convergence velocities and upper plates the predicted thermal structures share many common features. All models feature partial coupling between the slab and the overriding plate directly downdip of the thrust zone, invoked to replicate the cold nose observed in measurements of heat flow and seismic attenuation. We test four separate assumptions about the causes of the partial coupling: (1) the downdip end of the partial coupling is at a constant depth, (2) it is at constant distance trenchward from the arc, (3) it is defined by a critical surface slab temperature, or (4) it is adjusted such that the hottest part of the mantle wedge beneath the arc is at a constant temperature for all subduction zones. In all of these models, slabs reach temperatures where the top of the oceanic crust and sediments dehydrate before they reach subarc depths, and the overlying mantle wedge is too hot for hydrous minerals to be stable at subarc depths. By contrast, the interior of the oceanic crust and underlying mantle within the downgoing plate remains cold enough for hydrous phases to be stable beyond the arc in all but the hottest subduction zones, allowing water to be carried beyond the arc in the slab.The global range of subduction zone thermal models - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectTectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectTectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectThe orogen records the transition from oceanic subduction to continental collision.Tectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectOnly the oceanic-type eclogites underwent the Carboniferous HP metamorphism.Tectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectTectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectBack-arc basin basalts are suggested as the protoliths of oceanic-type eclogites.Tectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectTectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectTectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageTectonic evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision during the closure of Paleotethyan ocean: Geochronological and geochemical constraints from metamorphic rocks in the Hong'an orogen - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectHeterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectBoth upper and lower oceanic crust has been recognized in the mantle source of Chaihe-arershan basalts.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectThe recycled oceanic components in the mantle of whole eastern China varied widely, both spatially and temporally.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectThe ongoing Pacific slab subduction might trigger the heterogeneity of source components.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectRecycled oceanic components for continental intraplate basalts could maintain more water than components of typical OIBs.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectHeterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Characteristics of focal mechanisms in Chile subduction - ScienceDirectWe use the Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) solution of the earthquakes occurred in Chile subduction to analyze the characteristics of focal mechanisms. We define the angle between P, B, and T axes of focal mechanisms and three stress axes of tectonic stress field as the consistency parameter, to research the dynamic changes of focal mechanism pattern in earthquake preparation area before the 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake. The result shows that the consistency parameter decreases before the earthquake, and the area of the lower consistent parameter visually coincides with the distribution of aftershocks. This phenomenon is similar to the Load-Unload Response Ratio (LURR) decreases prior to the occurrence of macro-fracture happened in the acoustic emission experiments involving large rock specimens under tri-axial stress.Characteristics of focal mechanisms in Chile subduction - ScienceDirectThis work is supported by Public Utility Research Project (200808053), and Research Foundation of Science and Technology Plan Project in Hebei Province (12276903D).Seismic imaging of a megathrust splay fault in the North Chilean subduction zone (Central Andes) - ScienceDirectSeismic imaging of a megathrust splay fault in the North Chilean subduction zone (Central Andes) - ScienceDirectImaging of a predicted megathrust splay fault using pre-stack depth migration.Seismic imaging of a megathrust splay fault in the North Chilean subduction zone (Central Andes) - ScienceDirectHypocenters located by Bloch et al.

ScienceDirectThis study investigates the morphology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits from six back-arc hydrothermal vent fields along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) and Valu Fa Ridge (VFR) in the context of endmember vent fluid chemistry and proximity to the Tonga Subduction Zone. To complement deposit geochemistry, vent fluid analyses of Cu, Zn, Ba, Pb and H2,(aq) were completed to supplement existing data and enable thermodynamic calculations of mineral saturation states at in situ conditions. Results document southward increases in the abundance of mantle-incompatible elements in hydrothermal fluids (Ba and Pb) and SMS deposits (Ba, Pb, As, and Sb), which is also expressed in the abundance of barite (BaSO4) and galena (PbS) in SMS deposits. These increases correspond to a decrease in distance between the ELSC/VFR and the Tonga Subduction Zone that correlates with a change in crustal lithology from back-arc basin basalt in the north to mixed andesite, rhyolite, and dacite in the south. Barite influences deposit morphology, contributing to the formation of horizontal flanges and squat terraces. Results are also consistent with a regional-scale lowering of hydrothermal reaction zone temperatures from north to south (except at the southernmost Mariner vent field) that leads to lower-temperature, higher-pH vent fluids relative to mid-ocean ridges of similar spreading rates (Mottl et al., 2011). These fluids are Cu- and Zn-poor and the deposits formed from these fluids are Cu-poor but Zn-rich. In contrast, at the Mariner vent field, higher-temperature and lower pH vent fluids are hypothesized to result from higher reaction zone temperatures and the localized addition of acidic magmatic volatiles (Mottl et al., 2011). The Mariner fluids are Cu- and Zn-rich and vent from SMS deposits that are rich in Cu but poor in Zn with moderate amounts of Pb. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the contrasting metal contents of vent fluids and SMS deposits can be accounted for by vent fluid pH. Wurtzite/sphalerite ((Zn, Fe)S) and galena (PbS) are saturated at higher temperatures in higher-pH, Zn-, Cu-, and Pb-poor ELSC/VFR vent fluids, but are undersaturated at similar temperatures in low-pH, Zn-, Cu-, and Pb-rich vent fluids from the Mariner vent field.Influences of the Tonga Subduction Zone on seafloor massive sulfide deposits along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge - ScienceDirectInfluences of the Tonga Subduction Zone on seafloor massive sulfide deposits along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Accelerated pacific plate subduction following interplate thrust earthquakes at the Japan trench - ScienceDirectAccelerated pacific plate subduction following interplate thrust earthquakes at the Japan trench - ScienceDirectAccelerated pacific plate subduction following interplate thrust earthquakes at the Japan trench - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Zr-in-rutile thermometry of eclogites from the Karakaya Complex in NW Turkey: Implications for rutile growth during subduction zone metamorphism - ScienceDirectZr-in-rutile thermometry of eclogites from the Karakaya Complex in NW Turkey: Implications for rutile growth during subduction zone metamorphism - ScienceDirectPlate coupling along the Manila subduction zone between Taiwan and northern Luzon - ScienceDirectPlate coupling along the Manila subduction zone between Taiwan and northern Luzon - ScienceDirectPlate coupling along the Manila subduction zone between Taiwan and northern Luzon - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Metamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectMetamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectMetamorphic evolution of (U)HP subduction-related transient crust in the South TianshanMetamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectShallow-level juxtaposition of blueschists, eclogites and paragneissesMetamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectExhumation of the (U)HP rocks by channel flowMetamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectMetamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectAccretionary-type subduction and continental-type subductionMetamorphic evolution of (ultra)-high-pressure subduction-related transient crust in the South Tianshan Orogen (Central Asian Orogenic Belt): Geodynamic implications - ScienceDirectThe study of subduction-related high-pressure- and ultra-high-pressure metamorphic rocks exposed in orogenic belts is critical for unraveling the tectonothermal evolution of an orogen.

ScienceDirectWe provide a new mechanism to explain the seismic anisotropy in Mid. and S. America.Non-steady-state subduction and trench-parallel flow induced by overriding plate structure - ScienceDirectThe direction of plate tectonic motion and the direction of mantle flow, as inferred from observations of seismic anisotropy measurements, show a good global correlation far from subduction zones. However, this correlation is poor near subduction zones, where below the slab seismic anisotropy is aligned parallel to the trench and above the slab has a complex pattern, which has not been fully explained. Here we present time-dependent three-dimensional (3D) fully-dynamic simulations of subduction to study the effect of overriding plate structure on the evolution of slab geometry and induced mantle flow. We find that along-strike variation in thermal thickness of the overriding plate causes increased hydrodynamic suction and shallower slab dip beneath the colder portion of the overriding plate; the variation in slab geometry drives strong trench-parallel flow beneath the slab and a complex flow pattern above the slab. This new mechanism for driving trench-parallel flow provides a good explanation for seismic anisotropy observations from the Middle and South America subduction zones, where both slab dip and overriding plate thermal state are strongly variable and correlated, and thus may be an important mechanism in other subduction zones. The location and strength of trench-parallel flow vary with the time-dependent evolution of the slab, suggesting that the global variability in seismic anisotropy observations in subduction zones is in part due to the non-steady-state behavior of these systems.Non-steady-state subduction and trench-parallel flow induced by overriding plate structure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectDual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectWe analyze 3D structure of P-wave azimuthal anisotropy beneath central Japan.Dual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectCrust anisotropy has a close relationship with geological structure.Dual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectSegmentation of the PHS slab is shown by a regional variation of the slab anisotropy.Dual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectMantle anisotropy of the PAC slab is explained by frozen anisotropy.Dual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectA fragment of the PAC slab is suggested by anisotropic structure.Dual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectDual subduction tectonics and plate dynamics of central Japan shown by three-dimensional P-wave anisotropic structure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume- and arc-related (PAR) units grade from plume- to arc-like.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectPlate tectonics may have started as subduction began around Precambrian plume heads.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectRobert J.

ScienceDirectGeological and Geophysical Perspective of Supercritical Geothermal Energy in Subduction Zone, Northeast Japan - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of WRI-15.The chemistry of subduction-zone fluids - ScienceDirectSubduction zones generate voluminous magma and mediate global element cycling. Fluids are essential to this activity, yet their behavior is perhaps the most poorly understood aspect of the subduction process. Though many volatile components are subducted, H2O is the most abundant, is preferentially fractionated into the fluid phase, and, among terrestrial volatiles, is by far the most effective solvent. H2O therefore controls the chemical properties of subduction-zone fluids. Rising pressure (P) and temperature (T) along subduction paths yield increased H2O ionization, which enhances dissolved solute concentrations. Under appropriate conditions, silicate solubilities may become so high that there is complete miscibility between hydrous melts and dilute aqueous solutions. Miscible fluids of intermediate composition (e.g., 50% silicate, 50% H2O) are commonly invoked as material-transport agents in subduction zones; however, phase relations pose problems for their existence over significant length scales in the mantle. Nevertheless, this behavior provides a key clue pointing to the importance of polymerization of alkali aluminosilicate components in deep fluids. Aqueous aluminosilicate polymers may enhance solubility of important elements even in H2O-rich fluids. Subduction-zone fluids may be surprisingly dilute, having only two to three times the total dissolved solids (TDS) of seawater. Silica and alkalis are the dominant solutes, with significant Al and Ca and low Mg and Fe, consistent with a role for aqueous aluminosilicate polymers. Trace-element patterns of fluids carrying only dissolved silicate components are similar to those of primitive island-arc basalts, implying that reactive flow of H2O-rich, Cl-poor, alkali-aluminosilicate-bearing fluid is fundamental to element transport in the mantle wedge. Better understanding of the interaction of this fluid with the mantle wedge requires quantitative reaction-flow modeling, but further studies are required to achieve this goal.The chemistry of subduction-zone fluids - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The chemistry of subduction-zone fluids - ScienceDirectCraig Manning is a Professor of Geology and Geochemistry in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of California Los Angeles.

The model deformation is analyzed with a Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) system that allows for comparison of forearc deformation along the oblique limbs of the curved plate boundary and near the axis of curvature. Moreover, PIV allows for separation of the trench-parallel and trench-perpendicular components of strain, regardless of trench orientation. The resulting deformation maps show a remarkable symmetry and indicate drag of the forearc above the interplate coupling area towards the axis of curvature. Trench-perpendicular profiles show that along the oblique limbs of the plate boundary, the forearc is submitted to trench-normal shortening and trench-parallel shearing but not trench-parallel shortening or extension. This contrasts with the situation near the axis of symmetry where the forearc is submitted to trench-parallel and trench-perpendicular normal shortening, but is not sheared. The experimental results confirm that trench-normal thrusts observed in the fore-arc of the Central-Andes can be a mechanical consequence of subduction along a seaward-concave plate boundary if the degree of interplate coupling is large.Trench-parallel shortening in the forearc caused by subduction along a seaward-concave plate boundary: Insights from analogue modelling experiments -

These zircons rather preserve the isotopic memory of the magmatic crystallization of their igneous protolith. Another example of an eclogite sample from the French Massif Central illustrates the frequent mistake in the interpretation of the ages of the early hydrothermal alteration of zircons in the oceanic crust versus partial or complete recrystallization during eclogite facies metamorphism.From opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France) - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (135KB)Download full-size imageFrom opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Decarbonation efficiency in subduction zones: Implications for warm Cretaceous climates - ScienceDirectSubduction zones play a fundamental role in the geochemical cycle of carbon, and related arc volcanism is believed to exert primary control on atmospheric CO2 concentrations over geological time. Arc volcanism may have been particularly important in the most recent Greenhouse of the late Cretaceous, where it has been hypothesized that the subduction of the carbonate-rich Tethys contributed to overall higher volcanic CO2 outgassing rates and thus a warmer climate. To test this hypothesis, the decarbonation efficiencies of modern subduction zones were calculated through a geochemical database that compared subaerial arc CO2 fluxes with the subducting crust and sediment geochemistry. The modern data are used to postulate a CO2 recycling and degassing scenario for arc volcanism related to the closure of the Tethys. Our analysis indicates that the thermal structure of subduction zones controls the extent and depth of slab decarbonation, while the sediment geochemistry (e.g. the amount of carbonate sediment) may be of secondary importance. The calculated decarbonation efficiency of modern arcs ranges from 18 to 70%. Our calculations support recent models predicting carbon recycling through infiltration-driven decarbonation, and limited by water availability at sub-arc depths. This analysis allows us to make inferences about the potential volcanic CO2 flux from subduction of the Tethys during the Cretaceous, suggesting between an 8 and 222% increase over modern CO2 outgassing. We suggest that the primary reason for the increase in CO2 outgassing in the Cretaceous is contamination of arc magmas by platform carbonates in the overlying crust and increased decarbonation efficiency.Decarbonation efficiency in subduction zones: Implications for warm Cretaceous climates -

ScienceDirectEffects of mixing on water mass subduction are analyzed in the South Pacific Ocean. Model simulations using a passive tracer and its adjoint are employed in conjunction with a particle tracking method to distinguish effects of mixing from those of advection. The results show that mixing processes can contribute to as much as 20% of the overall subduction rate in the South Pacific. Of this mixing contribution, about 30% can be attributed to meso-scale eddies, including their associated bolus transport, while the major part (70%) is due to other diabatic processes. The impact of mixing reaches its maximum near the Sub-Antarctic Front, accounting for nearly 30% of the total subduction rate. Consequently, estimates based on tracing particles or on advection alone may significantly underestimate the subduction rate in the South Pacific Ocean.Effects of mixing on the subduction of South Pacific waters identified by a simulated passive tracer and its adjoint - ScienceDirectEffects of mixing on the subduction of South Pacific waters identified by a simulated passive tracer and its adjoint - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectThe meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectFushui complex is a typical syn-subduction product of mafic magmatism.The meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectFushui complex was originally derived from metasomatized lithospheric mantle.The meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectThe Qinling Group recorded a wholesale deep subduction of mini-continent.The meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectThe meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageThe meta-gabbroic complex of Fushui in north Qinling orogen: A case of syn-subduction mafic magmatism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Magma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectMagma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectMagma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectHe-C isotope coupling model reveals involvement of recycled Indian crustal materials.Magma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectContamination by crustal limestone is the first-order control on He-CO2 systematics of volatiles.Magma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectMagma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectMagma-derived CO2 emissions in the Tengchong volcanic field, SE Tibet: Implications for deep carbon cycle at intra-continent subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Silica diagenesis and its effect on interplate seismicity in cold subduction zones - ScienceDirectSilica diagenesis and its effect on interplate seismicity in cold subduction zones - ScienceDirectSilica diagenesis and its effect on interplate seismicity in cold subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Linking serpentinite geochemistry with tectonic evolution at the subduction plate-interface: The Voltri Massif case study (Ligurian Western Alps, Italy) - ScienceDirectLinking serpentinite geochemistry with tectonic evolution at the subduction plate-interface: The Voltri Massif case study (Ligurian Western Alps, Italy) - ScienceDirectLinking serpentinite geochemistry with tectonic evolution at the subduction plate-interface: The Voltri Massif case study (Ligurian Western Alps, Italy) - ScienceDirectOur dataset shows that undeformed serpentinite still preserves an oceanic geochemical fingerprint, whereas mylonitic serpentinite is reset in its concentrations of FME and its B, Sr and Pb isotope compositions, due to interaction with sediment- and crust-derived fluids. The environment of this interaction is either compatible with (i) an outer-rise zone setting, with percolation of seawater-derived fluids enriched in sedimentary components into bending-related fault structures, or with (ii) subduction channel domains, where ascending sediment-derived slab fluids infiltrate slices of former oceanic serpentinite accreted to the plate interface domain. Influx of sediment-derived subduction fluids along major deformation zones in serpentinite modifies the element budget of the rocks, with important implications for element recycling and the tectonic history of serpentinite. The B, Sr and Pb isotopic systematics, coupled with FME concentration in serpentinites are particularly helpful geochemical tracers of interaction between different reservoirs in subduction-interface environments, and are more sensitive than the traditionally applied stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions.Linking serpentinite geochemistry with tectonic evolution at the subduction plate-interface: The Voltri Massif case study (Ligurian Western Alps, Italy) -

The seismic transects bring out a contrasting polarity in the subduction regime with an oblique east- to southward subduction of the Yinshan Block and a westward subduction of the Yanliao Block. Here I propose a double-sided subduction history for the NCC, similar to the ongoing subduction process in the Western Pacific. Such double-sided subduction is considered to promote rapid amalgamation of continental fragments within supercontinents and the subduction polarities and mantle dynamics of NCC are therefore considered to be critical in evaluating the final assembly of the Paleoproterozoic supercontinent Columbia.Assembling North China Craton within the Columbia supercontinent: The role of double-sided subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction-triggered magmatic pulses: A new class of plumes? - ScienceDirectSubduction-triggered magmatic pulses: A new class of plumes? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Episodic Precambrian subduction - ScienceDirectEpisodic Precambrian subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamic wedge failure reveals anomalous energy radiation of shallow subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectDynamic wedge failure reveals anomalous energy radiation of shallow subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectDynamic wedge failure reveals anomalous energy radiation of shallow subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectDynamic wedge failure reveals anomalous energy radiation of shallow subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectExtensive failure is an energy sink, leading to low moment-scaled energy.Dynamic wedge failure reveals anomalous energy radiation of shallow subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectDynamic wedge failure reveals anomalous energy radiation of shallow subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Distinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China - ScienceDirectInteraction between the subducting slab, the overriding continental lithosphere and mantle flow are fundamental geodynamic processes of subduction systems. Eastern China is an ideal natural laboratory to investigate the behavior and evolution of cratonic blocks within a subduction system. In this study, we investigate deformation of the upper mantle beneath eastern China. We present seismic shear wave splitting measurements from three networks consisting of over 483 broadband stations, with 157 stations giving a total of 516 results. The splitting parameters exhibit complex regional patterns but are relatively coherent within individual tectonic units. Tectonic blocks exhibited distinctive fast directions relative to regional features. The dominant attitude of fast directions for the North China Craton was subparallel to the direction of subduction, whereas fast directions for Southeastern China were perpendicular to the direction of subduction. The shear wave splitting measurements were interpreted according to a high resolution tomographic body-wave velocity model. Combining these two datasets showed that the predominant geodynamic models for the region (mantle plume, mantle wedge and flat-slab subduction models) are incompatible with the observations presented here. We suggest that the North China Craton, Yangtze Craton and the Cathaysia block have undergone different deformational events due to differing mantle flow patterns, and distinct spatial and temporal subduction histories of the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates.Distinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China -

ScienceDirectCrystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) of rocks from an exhumed subduction channel of the Alpine orogen were determined using time-of-flight neutron diffraction. This method allows the investigation of large polymineralic samples and, more importantly, the application of full pattern fit methods to constrain CPOs of mineralogically complex rocks. Samples studied include intensely deformed fresh and retrogressed eclogites, as well as metasediments, which are interleaved with the eclogites in the subduction channel. From the CPO, seismic properties of the samples were calculated. P-wave anisotropies of the eclogite samples are fairly low, with an average of about 1.5%, and mainly constrained by pronounced omphacite CPO. Growth and deformation of retrograde amphibole in the eclogites also led to a pronounced CPO, which has a large impact on seismic anisotropies by raising them to up to 3.7% and changing the orientations of velocity maxima. Elastic anisotropies of the subducted metasediments are higher (up to 7.4%) and constrained by quartz and mica CPO in clastics and by calcite CPO in marble. VP/VS ratios may help to distinguish fresh eclogites from retrogressed ones, and both rock types from mantle peridotites of downgoing lithospheric slabs in seismic imaging. Our data also indicate that subducted terrigenous sediments not only are strongly anisotropic, but also have low VP/VS ratios. This way there may be the potential to image them by seismic tomography at depth in active subduction channels.Crystallographic preferred orientations of exhumed subduction channel rocks from the Eclogite Zone of the Tauern Window (Eastern Alps, Austria), and implications on rock elastic anisotropies at great depths - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Normal upper plate fault reactivation in northern Chile and the subduction earthquake cycle: From geological observations and static Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) change - ScienceDirectNormal upper plate fault reactivation in northern Chile and the subduction earthquake cycle: From geological observations and static Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) change - ScienceDirectCFS changes induced by the subduction earthquake cycleNormal upper plate fault reactivation in northern Chile and the subduction earthquake cycle: From geological observations and static Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) change - ScienceDirectNormal fault reactivation related to the subduction earthquake cycleNormal upper plate fault reactivation in northern Chile and the subduction earthquake cycle: From geological observations and static Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) change - ScienceDirectUpper plate structure controlling the interplate properties and fault reactivationNormal upper plate fault reactivation in northern Chile and the subduction earthquake cycle: From geological observations and static Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) change - ScienceDirectNormal upper plate fault reactivation in northern Chile and the subduction earthquake cycle: From geological observations and static Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) change - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Episodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectEpisodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectTen-year formation fluid pressure records from the Nankai subduction zone are presented.Episodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectEpisodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectPost-seismic pressure anomalies and VLFEs suggest triggered slow slip at Nankai.Episodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectEpisodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectNumerous concurrent slip and VLFE swarms show Nankai to be close to a state of failure.Episodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectEpisodic deformation and inferred slow slip at the Nankai subduction zone during the first decade of CORK borehole pressure and VLFE monitoring - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Distribution of hydrous minerals in the subduction system beneath Mexico - ScienceDirectDistribution of hydrous minerals in the subduction system beneath Mexico - ScienceDirectDistribution of hydrous minerals in the subduction system beneath Mexico - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Distribution of hydrous minerals in the subduction system beneath Mexico - ScienceDirectNow at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, NY 10964, USA.The Subduction Factory: Geochemical perspectives - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction zone metamorphic pathway for deep carbon cycling: II.

The heterogeneity in the structural evolution, the interior regime as well as external architecture of individual margins is reflected in their seismic character, resulting in a segmentation along-strike as well as along-dip. Subduction zones generate more than 80% of global earthquakes above magnitude 8.0, but rupture characteristics are highly individual and linked to margin specific geometrical conditions. Major segments of subduction zones are commonly submerged in deep water and difficult to access at the majority of margins. Marine geophysical techniques, which are able to image the complex structures in these settings with sufficient coherency and depth penetration, have proven crucial to improve our knowledge on the geological framework of the different types of subduction zones. The aim of this review paper is to unravel the structural diversity of convergent margins and between individual subduction zone segments. Field data from different margins around the globe deliver images of the seafloor and subsurface in unprecedented resolution, which show segmentation to be far more complex than previously inferred. Along-strike segmentation results in accretionary segments contiguous to erosive segments along a single margin. Modes of mass transfer must hence be viewed as transient processes dependent on sediment supply and lower plate structure. Along-strike segment boundaries commonly correlate with underthrusting lower plate relief that controls the deep deformation of a subduction zone and the spatial and temporal variations in slip behavior. Examples of underthrusting oceanic basement relief at different stages of subduction elucidate their impact on the inner geometry of the margin. Lower plate heterogeneities occur at subduction zones worldwide and thus pose a common phenomenon, whose role as barriers to seismic rupture constitute a central control on subduction zone seismicity and segmentation.Invited review paper: The control of subduction zone structural complexity and geometry on margin segmentation and seismicity - ScienceDirectInvited review paper: The control of subduction zone structural complexity and geometry on margin segmentation and seismicity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The southwestern edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone: A high Q mantle wedge - ScienceDirectThe southwestern edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone: A high Q mantle wedge - ScienceDirectThe southwestern edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone: A high Q mantle wedge - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Petrology and geochemistry of the Guyang hornblendite complex in the Yinshan block, North China Craton: Implications for the melting of subduction-modified mantle - ScienceDirectPetrology and geochemistry of the Guyang hornblendite complex in the Yinshan block, North China Craton: Implications for the melting of subduction-modified mantle - ScienceDirectGuyang hornblendite complexes formed during Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic.Petrology and geochemistry of the Guyang hornblendite complex in the Yinshan block, North China Craton: Implications for the melting of subduction-modified mantle - ScienceDirectIt emplaced as a crystal mush, with orthopyroxene as cumulus phase.Petrology and geochemistry of the Guyang hornblendite complex in the Yinshan block, North China Craton: Implications for the melting of subduction-modified mantle - ScienceDirectIt derived from a subduction-modified mantle involving ridge subduction and slab window.Petrology and geochemistry of the Guyang hornblendite complex in the Yinshan block, North China Craton: Implications for the melting of subduction-modified mantle - ScienceDirectPetrology and geochemistry of the Guyang hornblendite complex in the Yinshan block, North China Craton: Implications for the melting of subduction-modified mantle - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamic models of downgoing plate-buoyancy driven subduction: Subduction motions and energy dissipation - ScienceDirectIt is much debated whether the forces associated with the downgoing plate, the overriding plate, passive or active mantle flow are dominant in controlling the paths of plates into the mantle. We investigate the dynamics and energetics for a free subduction system, driven solely by downgoing plate buoyancy, using a finite-element model of a viscoelastic plate with a free surface, sinking into a passive unbounded mantle represented by drag forces. Parameters are varied to study effects of an asthenosphere, ridge push, and a passive overriding plate, for a range of subducting plate viscosities and densities. Such a single, free plate achieves subduction mainly through trench retreat. Most of the energy dissipation occurs in driving the passive mantle response. As a result, the slab's sinking velocity is its Stokes velocity, determined by lithospheric buoyancy and mantle viscosity. The total subduction velocity and dip adjust to minimize bending dissipation in the lithosphere, and are affected by slab rheology as well as buoyancy. A low viscosity asthenosphere and ridge push facilitate plate advance, increasing plate dips and lowering subduction velocity, while suction and buoyancy of a work-free passive overriding plate decreases plate dips, thus increasing subduction and rollback velocities. However, the geometrical relation between the different parameters is the same in all model cases, because the slabs sink according to their Stokes velocity. The free subduction models thus provide a reference that can be used to distinguish the signature of downgoing plate buoyancy from that of other driving forces in global compilations of subduction parameters.Dynamic models of downgoing plate-buoyancy driven subduction: Subduction motions and energy dissipation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Slow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectSlow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectBorehole monitoring at subduction prism toe constrains co-seismic and post-seismic strains.Slow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectDilatational co-seismic strain requires stress relief below or landward of outer prism.Slow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectSeafloor pressure monitoring reveals slow and delayed post-seismic uplift and inferred slip.Slow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectUplift and correlated formation-pressure transients indicate episodic slip on decollement.Slow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectSlow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectSlow and delayed deformation and uplift of the outermost subduction prism following ETS and seismogenic slip events beneath Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evidence for a subduction component in the diamond-bearing mantle of the Siberian craton - ScienceDirectEvidence for a subduction component in the diamond-bearing mantle of the Siberian craton - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variations of slab dip and overriding plate tectonics during subduction: Insights from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectWe present small-scale laboratory models of oceanic subduction in which plates motion is imposed by lateral boundary conditions. The oceanic plate moves trenchward at constant speed and subducts below a fixed overriding plate. In this configuration, the long-term process of subduction is not steady-state. Slab interaction with the upper mantle-lower mantle boundary results in periods of slab flattening during which the dip of the slab diminishes, followed by periods of slab steepening. The overriding plate tectonic regime is influenced by the dynamics of subduction, slab anchoring favouring trench perpendicular shortening. When the slab is anchored, slab flattening further favours shortening, while slab steepening favours extension or smaller shortening rates. Non-steady-state long-term subduction may explain part of the variability of slab geometries evidenced by statistical analyses of present-day subduction zones. Experiments suggest that, despite boundary conditions applied on the converging plates do not change, tectonics pulses within the overriding plate may be caused by this non-steady-state behaviour.Variations of slab dip and overriding plate tectonics during subduction: Insights from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variations of slab dip and overriding plate tectonics during subduction: Insights from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectCharles Stern is Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.

Here we extend such models to incorporate an overriding plate and present the results of how such an overriding plate feedbacks into the dynamics of free subduction. In this study, we address three fundamental aspects of these dynamics: 1) How does the presence of an overriding plate change the force balance at the convergent margins? 2) How are the forces from deep subduction propagated to the surface? And 3) what controls the stress regime in a system of coupled upper and subducting plates and how is it expressed in the deformations and plate motions? In general, we find that the evolution of subduction zones is strongly controlled by both the interactions between the slab and the upper-lower mantle discontinuity as well as the strength of the upper plate. When either the subducting or upper plates are unable to move, subduction motions are steady state and partitioned entirely into either slab rollback or plate advance, respectively. When conditions favour a quasi-stationary trench, the subducted lithosphere can form into a pile with multiple recumbent folds of slab material atop the lower mantle. Alternating between forwards- and backwards-draping slab, the corresponding horizontal trench motions at the surface are frontward and rearward, respectively, resulting in either a compressive or extensional regime in the back-arc. Time-dependent forcing arising from the slab piling behaviour can have a feedback with upper plate and produce strongly non-steady state, intermittent phases of upper plate deformation as those commonly observed on Earth. Two types of discontinuous back-arc strain evolution are identified: (1) periodic, when recurrent phases of strain over finite durations are accommodated by (viscous) stretching/thickening of the plate, and (2) episodic, when upper plate deformation localizes (plastic strain) and allows for punctuated episodes. These phases can include extension, quiescence, and compression, giving rise to a large variety of possible tectonic evolutions. The models presented here provide insight into the dynamics behind the non-steady-state evolution of subduction, which can help unravel seemingly erratic motions of major convergent margins and back-arc deformations around the Pacific and Indian Oceans during the Cenozoic.Upper plate controls on deep subduction, trench migrations and deformations at convergent margins - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Invited review paper: Fault creep caused by subduction of rough seafloor relief - ScienceDirectAmong the wide range of thermal, petrologic, hydrological, and structural factors that potentially affect subduction earthquakes, the roughness of the subducting seafloor is among the most important. By reviewing seismic and geodetic studies of megathrust locking/creeping state, we find that creeping is the predominant mode of subduction in areas of extremely rugged subducting seafloor such as the Kyushu margin, Manila Trench, northern Hikurangi, and southeastern Costa Rica. In Java and Mariana, megathrust creeping state is not yet constrained by geodetic observations, but the very rugged subducting seafloor and lack of large earthquakes also suggest aseismic creep. Large topographic features on otherwise relatively smooth subducting seafloor such as the Nazca Ridge off Peru, the Investigator Fracture Zone off Sumatra, and the Joban seamount chain in southern Japan Trench also cause creep and often stop the propagation of large ruptures. Similar to all other known giant earthquakes, the Tohoku earthquake of March 2011 occurred in an area of relatively smooth subducting seafloor. The Tohoku event also offers an example of subducting seamounts stopping rupture propagation. Very rugged subducting seafloor not only retards the process of shear localization, but also gives rise to heterogeneous stresses. In this situation, the fault zone creeps because of distributed deformation of fractured rocks, and the creep may take place as transient events of various spatial and temporal scales accompanied with small and medium-size earthquakes. This process cannot be described as stable or unstable friction along a single contact surface. The association of large earthquakes with relatively smooth subducting seafloor and creep with very rugged subducting seafloor calls for further investigation. Seafloor near-trench geodetic monitoring, high-resolution imaging of subduction fault structure, studies of exhumed ancient subduction zones, and laboratory studies of low-temperature creep will greatly improve our understanding of the seismogenic and creep processes and their hazard implications.Invited review paper: Fault creep caused by subduction of rough seafloor relief -

We present a case study of lavas from the Central Island Province (CIP) of the Mariana arc, supplemented by representative sedimentary and altered oceanic crust (AOC) inputs from ODP Leg 129 Hole 801 outboard of the Mariana trench. Given the large Tl concentration contrast between the mantle and subduction inputs coupled with previously published distinctive Tl isotope signatures of sediment and AOC, the Tl isotope system has great potential to distinguish different inputs to arc lavas. Furthermore, CIP lavas have well-established inter island variability, providing excellent context for the examination of Tl as a new stable isotope tracer.Assessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectAssessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectAssessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMuch work remains to better understand the controls on Tl processing through a subduction zone.

Specific type of source, propagation path and site geologic condition may perhaps simultaneously be responsible for such anomalous behaviour. The empirical attenuation relations developed by Atkinson and Boore [3] using a global database for subduction zone earthquakes have been therefore suitably modified to be more appropriate for the northeast India. The modified relationships are developed by combining the data for both horizontal and vertical components of motion. The response spectra of the accelerograms recorded in northeast India from earthquakes with widely varying magnitude and distance are, in general, found to match very well with the predictions from the modified attenuation model. The proposed model can thus be used to obtain more realistic estimate of the contribution of in-slab subduction zone earthquakes to seismic hazard in the northeast Indian region.Response spectral attenuation relations for in-slab earthquakes in Indo-Burmese subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mobility of elements in a continental subduction zone: evidence from the UHP metamorphic complex of the Kokchetav massif - ScienceDirectMobility of elements in a continental subduction zone: evidence from the UHP metamorphic complex of the Kokchetav massif - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recycling of water, carbon, and sulfur during subduction of serpentinites: A stable isotope study of Cerro del Almirez, Spain - ScienceDirectRecycling of water, carbon, and sulfur during subduction of serpentinites: A stable isotope study of Cerro del Almirez, Spain - ScienceDirectRecycling of water, carbon, and sulfur during subduction of serpentinites: A stable isotope study of Cerro del Almirez, Spain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-triggered deposits in the subduction trench of the north Ecuador/south Colombia margin and their implication for paleoseismology - ScienceDirectEarthquake-triggered deposits in the subduction trench of the north Ecuador/south Colombia margin and their implication for paleoseismology - ScienceDirectEarthquake-triggered deposits in the subduction trench of the north Ecuador/south Colombia margin and their implication for paleoseismology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectFluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectThe Gagnone metaperidotites record multistage subduction metasomatism and dehydration.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectThey trap inclusions of fluids evolved during breakdown of antigorite and of chlorite.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectThe trace element compositions of such fluids indicate recycling of sedimentary components.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectAltered subduction-zone mantle uptakes and delivers sediment-derived elements to fluids.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectThis transfer process may not require concomitant subarc dehydration of slab metasediment.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectSerpentinites release at sub-arc depths volatiles and several fluid-mobile trace elements found in arc magmas. Constraining element uptake in these rocks and defining the trace element composition of fluids released upon serpentinite dehydration can improve our understanding of mass transfer across subduction zones and to volcanic arcs. The eclogite-facies garnet metaperidotite and chlorite harzburgite bodies embedded in paragneiss of the subduction melange from Cima di Gagnone derive from serpentinized peridotite protoliths and are unique examples of ultramafic rocks that experienced subduction metasomatism and devolatilization. In these rocks, metamorphic olivine and garnet trap polyphase inclusions representing the fluid released during high-pressure breakdown of antigorite and chlorite. Combining major element mapping and laser-ablation ICP-MS bulk inclusion analysis, we characterize the mineral content of polyphase inclusions and quantify the fluid composition. Silicates, Cl-bearing phases, sulphides, carbonates, and oxides document post-entrapment mineral growth in the inclusions starting immediately after fluid entrapment.Fluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectFluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectFluid-related inclusions in Alpine high-pressure peridotite reveal trace element recycling during subduction-zone dehydration of serpentinized mantle (Cima di Gagnone, Swiss Alps) - ScienceDirectThe Gagnone study-case demonstrates that serpentinized peridotites acquire water and fluid-mobile elements during ocean floor hydration and through exchange with sediment-equilibrated fluids in the early subduction stages.

They are located in the prolongation of those mapped on the Atlantic seafloor entering subduction, such as the Barracuda Ridge. This MCS grid also provides evidences on unexpected huge along-strike topographical variation of the backstop basement and of the deformation style affecting the outer forearc crust and sediments. Their mapping clearly indicates two principal areas of active deformation in the prolongation of the major Barracuda and Tiburon ridges and also other forearc basement highs that correspond to the prolongation of smaller oceanic basement highs recently mapped on the Atlantic seafloor. Although different in detail, the two main deforming forearc domains share similarities in style.Along-arc segmentation and interaction of subducting ridges with the Lesser Antilles Subduction forearc crust revealed by MCS imaging - ScienceDirectThe imaged deformation of the sedimentary stratification reveals a time- and space-dependent faulting by successive warping and unwarping, which deformation can be readily attributed to the forearc backstop sweeping over the two obliquely-oriented elongated and localized topographical ridges. The induced faulting producing vertical scarps in this transport does not require a regional arc-parallel extensional regime as proposed for the inner forearc domain, and may support a partitioned tectonic deformation such as in the case of an outer forearc sliver.Along-arc segmentation and interaction of subducting ridges with the Lesser Antilles Subduction forearc crust revealed by MCS imaging -

The benchmark cases are based on a thermomechanical approach in which the slab is prescribed kinematically and the wedge flow is computed dynamically. We propose various cases to investigate the influence of boundary conditions and rheology on wedge flow and resulting thermal structure. A comparison between the codes suggest that accurate modeling of the thermal field requires a good implementation of the velocity discontinuity along the seismogenic zone and high resolution in the thermal boundary layers. A minor modification to the boundary conditions of the wedge flow is also necessary to avoid a pressure singularity that exists in analytical solutions of the cornerflow model.A community benchmark for subduction zone modeling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectThree-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirect3D finite-element models reveal forearc deformation during ridge subduction.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectForearc deformation is largely controlled by orientation and shape of the ridge.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectHigher friction along the plate interface increases displacements and strain.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectStructure and mechanical strength of forearc control mainly the strain distribution.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectGeological and geophysical data show that the forearc of subduction zones experiences strong deformation during the subduction of aseismic oceanic ridges. In order to better understand ridge-related forearc deformation patterns, we performed a series of three-dimensional finite-element models, in which we varied the ridge shape, the friction coefficient of the plate interface and the mechanical strength of the forearc. Experiments were carried out for migrating/non-migrating ridges and accretive/erosive margins, respectively. Our results show that the subducting ridge uplifts the forearc and induces horizontal displacements that alter the strain regime of both erosive and accretive forearcs. Generally, shortening prevails in front of the ridge, while domains of shortening and extension exist above the ridge. Models with stationary ridges show high uplift rates only above the ridge tip, whereas the forearc above migrating ridges experiences uplift above the leading ridge flank and subsequent subsidence above the trailing flank. The height and width of the ridge as well as the friction coefficient of the plate interface have the largest effect on the forearc deformation patterns, whereas the mechanical strength of the forearc plays a lesser role. Forearc indentation at the trench is largest for high and broad ridges, high friction coefficients and/or weak forearc material. Shortening and extension of the forearc above the ridge are more intense for high and narrow ridges. Our model results provide information about the distribution of ridge-induced displacements and strain fields and hence help to identify deformation patterns caused by subducting aseismic ridges in nature.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectVolatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectVolatile fluxes from volcanoes at subduction zones are reviewed.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectPersistent degassing is the major emission source of most of volatiles.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectDiffuse emission of H2O, CO2 and Cl by springs and soil gases are also important.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectLower crust foundering controls the volatile budget of the subduction zone crust.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectGlobal volatile fluxes from subaerial volcanoes at subduction zones were estimated based on a compilation of fluxes from various sources, including persistent degassing, hot and cold springs, soil degassing, and eruptions. Because worldwide comprehensive datasets are not available, especially for diffuse volatile discharges, volatile fluxes from Japan arcs were estimated based on detailed datasets, and the regional fluxes were extrapolated to the global flux with consideration of the regional characteristics of volcanic volatile compositions, which were estimated based on volcanic gas compositions of persistent degassing. The estimated global fluxes indicate that persistent degassing is the major source of volatiles, especially for S with a contribution of 80%. Diffuse discharges and persistent degassing are similarly important sources of H2O, CO2, and Cl, but the contribution of explosive eruptions is less than 15% for all the volatiles. The estimates of diffuse degassing fluxes include large errors due to limited data. However, the potential impact of these sources on the global flux indicates the importance of further studies to quantify these fluxes. The volatile budget of subduction zone volcanism was evaluated by comparing the estimated volatile fluxes, the volatile contents in the crust, and the primitive magma volatile contents. The contribution of volatiles remaining in the crust are not significant; however, consideration of lower crust foundering significantly alters the volatile budget estimate because the primitive magma supply rate should be significantly increased to account for the lower crust foundering.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction zone dynamics in the SW Pacific plate boundary region constrained from high-precision Pb isotope data - ScienceDirectSubduction zone dynamics in the SW Pacific plate boundary region constrained from high-precision Pb isotope data - ScienceDirectSubduction zone dynamics in the SW Pacific plate boundary region constrained from high-precision Pb isotope data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Plate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectA dense nationwide seismic network recently constructed in Japan has been yielding large volumes of high-quality data that have made it possible to investigate the seismic structure in the Japanese subduction zone with unprecedented resolution. In this article, recent studies on the subduction of the Philippine Sea and Pacific plates beneath the Japanese Islands and the mechanism of earthquake and magma generation associated with plate subduction are reviewed. Seismic tomographic studies have shown that the Philippine Sea plate subducting beneath southwest Japan is continuous throughout the entire region, from Kanto to Kyushu, without disruption or splitting even beneath the Izu Peninsula as suggested in the past. The contact of the Philippine Sea plate with the Pacific plate subducting below has been found to cause anomalously deep interplate and intraslab earthquake activity in Kanto. Detailed waveform inversion studies have revealed that the asperity model is applicable to interplate earthquakes. Analyses of dense seismic and GPS network data have confirmed the existence of episodic slow slip accompanied in many instances by low-frequency tremors/earthquakes on the plate interface, which are inferred to play an important role in stress loading at asperities. High-resolution studies of the spatial variation of intraslab seismicity and the seismic velocity structure of the slab crust strongly support the dehydration embrittlement hypothesis for the generation of intraslab earthquakes. Seismic tomography studies have shown that water released by dehydration of the slab and secondary convection in the mantle wedge, mechanically induced by slab subduction, are responsible for magma generation in the Japanese islands. Water of slab origin is also inferred to be responsible for large anelastic local deformation of the arc crust leading to inland crustal earthquakes that return the arc crust to a state of spatially uniform deformation.Plate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Plate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectPlate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectJunichi Nakajima earned a BSc (1998), MSc (2000) and PhD (2003) in Geophysics at Tohoku University, Japan.

ScienceDirectSubduction zone metamorphism (SZM) and behaviors of chemical elements in response to this process are important for both arc magmatism and mantle compositional heterogeneity. In this paper, we report the results of our petrographic and geochemical studies on blueschist and eclogite facies rocks of sedimentary and basaltic protoliths from two metamorphic sub-belts with different metamorphic histories in the North Qilian Mountain, Northwest China. The protolith of low-grade blueschists is basaltic in composition and is most likely produced in a back-arc setting, while the protoliths of high-grade blueschists/eclogites geochemically resemble the present-day normal and enriched mid-oceanic ridge basalts plus some volcanic arc rocks. The meta-sedimentary rocks, including meta-graywacke, meta-pelite, meta-chert and marble, show geochemical similarity to global oceanic (subducted) sediments. Assuming that high field strength elements (HFSEs) are relatively immobile, the correlated variations of rare earth elements (REEs) and Th with HFSEs suggest that all these elements are probably also immobile, whereas Pb and Sr are mobile in rocks of both basaltic and sedimentary protoliths during SZM. Ba, Cs and Rb are immobile in rocks of sedimentary protoliths and mobile in rocks of basaltic protolith. The apparent mobility of U in rocks of basaltic protolith may be inherited from seafloor alterations rather than caused by SZM.Elemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectOn the basis of in situ mineral compositional analysis (both major and trace elements), the most significant trace element storage minerals in these subduction-zone metamorphic rocks are: lawsonite, pumpellyite, apatite, garnet and epidote group minerals for REEs, white micas (both phengite and paragonite) for large ion lithophile elements, rutile and titanite for HFSEs. The presence and stability of these minerals exert the primary controls on the geochemical behaviors of most of these elements during SZM. The immobility of REEs, Th and U owing to their redistribution into newly formed minerals suggests that subduction-zone dehydration metamorphism will not contribute to the enrichment of these elements in arc magmatism. These observations require the formation and contribution of supercritical fluids or hydrous melts (these can effectively transport the aforementioned incompatible elements) from greater depths to arc magmatism. In addition, the overall sub-chondritic Nb/Ta ratio retained in rutile-bearing eclogites indicates that the subducting/subducted residual ocean crust passing through SZM cannot be responsible for the missing Nb (relative to Ta) in the bulk silicate earth.Elemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectElemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Determination of corner frequencies of source spectra for subduction earthquakes in Avacha Gulf (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectDetermination of corner frequencies of source spectra for subduction earthquakes in Avacha Gulf (Kamchatka) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Submarine landslides at subduction margins: Insights from physical models - ScienceDirectSubmarine landslides, which commonly develop along subduction margins at the front of accretionary prisms, have recently been recognized as one of the most serious geohazards. To investigate the mechanical processes involved in the development of these landslides, a series of sandbox experiments were performed, and the results were analyzed using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Numerous slope failures, which may be analogous to natural submarine landslides, were produced on the model surface. The slope failures can be classified as follows: Type I failures, which are relatively small but are frequently developed on the lower parts of the slope; and Type II failures, which are relatively large and cover the entire slope, but occur less frequently. Detailed observations reveal that the failure process can be divided into four stages: 1) pre-failure, 2) steepening of the lower slope, 3) Type I failure, and 4) Type II failure. The minor Type I slides act as precursors of major Type II failures. Each slope failure produces a topographic undulation, triggering events in adjacent areas and a lateral migration of discrete slope failures. Although such experiments provide useful insight into slope failure processes, a detailed 3D analysis of the failed sediment is vital if we are to understand the precise history of thrust activity at subduction margins. Recent and Miocene accretionary prisms along the Nankai Trough, Japan, display the geometric and lithologic characteristics of Type I and Type II failures in their slide deposits.Submarine landslides at subduction margins: Insights from physical models -

To quantitatively evaluate the earlier proposed mechanisms, we simulate the post-100 Ma subduction history below South America using 4-D geodynamic models by progressively incorporating plate kinematics, seafloor ages and key tectonic features including the buoyant oceanic crust, continental cratons, oceanic plateaus (i.e. the inferred Inca plateau, subducting Nazca Ridge and Juan Fernandez Ridge), as well as deformable trench profiles according to recent geological reconstructions. We find that, in the absence of an overriding plate and subducting buoyancy features, the seafloor age affects slab dip angle by controlling the slab's mechanical strength (i.e., the resistance to bending) and negative buoyancy (integrated positive density anomaly that enhances bending). Our models show that slab strength dominates its buoyancy at age >30 Ma and the opposite for younger ages. The existence of a thick overriding plate reduces the slab dip by increasing dynamic suction, and individual cratonic roots further lead to along-trench variations of dip angle reduction. While dynamic suction from the overriding plate generates a permanent reduction of the long-wavelength slab dip angle, it is the final addition of subducting oceanic plateau and aseismic ridges that produces the transient and localized flat-slabs as observed. These results suggest that all mechanisms except the buoyancy features affect the slab dip only at large spatial scales. Our best-fit model with all the above tectonic features included provides a good match to both the upper mantle Benioff zones and the temporal evolution of volcanic arcs since the mid-Miocene. The imperfect match of the Peruvian flat-slab is likely associated with the uncertain 3-D configuration of the Amazonian craton.Simulation of late Cenozoic South American flat-slab subduction using geodynamic models with data assimilation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectWe apply a finite difference numerical thermal model to the shallow region of the Hikurangi subduction margin, North Island, New Zealand. This subduction zone is characterised by subduction of thick and buoyant crust of the Hikurangi Plateau and along-strike variations in subduction obliquity, onshore surface heat flow (low in the south, high in the north), inferred pore-fluid pressure and seismic style (locked in the south, aseismic in the north).On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThe model reproduces low onshore surface heat flow observed in the southern Hikurangi margin. We propose that greater surface heat flow in the north is caused by shear heating and convective heat flow by fluids escaping from the interface. The model predicts that the Hikurangi megathrust is comparatively cold, so that if the lower limit of the interface seismogenic zone is thermally controlled, it should occur near the intersection with the hangingwall Moho. This agrees with observation in the southern, locked segment, but thermal control alone cannot explain the shallow interseismic locking depth in the central and northern margin.On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectIn crustal strength curves, changing fluid pressure is capable of moving the brittle-viscous transition vertically by tens of kilometres. We propose that subduction zone seismic style depends on the fluid pressure regime both in the hangingwall and along the interface, and define four end-member types of megathrust fault segments. Contrary to many previous studies, we suggest that the high fluid pressure, low shear strength, end-member is fully coupled, with potential for large interplate earthquakes. In the hydrostatic case the fault is stronger, but the brittle-viscous transition occurs significantly shallower than in the near-lithostatic case, inferred to promote aseismic creep at relatively shallow levels. Along-strike variation in seismic style on the Hikurangi megathrust can therefore be explained by variation in fluid pressure state along the margin.On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectUnderstanding what controls this short-lived exhumation and the detachment and migration of oceanic crustal slices along the subduction channel will provide useful insights into the interplate mechanical coupling in subduction zones.Exhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectSubduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectWe distinguished two different types of rodingites in East Othris ophiolites.Subduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectFluids were alkaline with relatively high pH.Subduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectRodingites were incorporated into the exhumed materials of the subduction channel.Subduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectLate-stage derodingitization processes have been identified.Subduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectSubduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectSubduction-related rodingites from East Othris, Greece: Mineral reactions and physicochemical conditions of formation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Paleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectPaleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectProtolith of eclogites is Ordovician arc-type magma in an active continental margin.Paleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectFragments that composed the protolith of micaschists deposited in an accretionary prism.Paleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectProtolith of eclogites was scraped from the upper continental plate due to basal erosion.Paleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectProtolith of micaschists was removed from the accretionary prism because of frontal erosion.Paleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectPaleozoic subduction erosion involving accretionary wedge sediments in the South Tianshan Orogen: Evidence from geochronological and geochemical studies on eclogites and their host metasediments - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reflection Image Spectroscopy across the Andean subduction zone - ScienceDirectThis paper presents new insights into the South American subduction zone from reprocessed seismic images. We applied a 3D Kirchhoff prestack depth migration scheme to data sets containing different narrow frequency ranges in order to extract additional details from seismic reflection images. This approach accounts for the effects of scattering on the seismic image, especially for structures below a heterogeneous overburden. The reflection image in such environments will differ significantly when focusing on different frequency ranges due to the frequency dependence of scattering that is likely to be present. The narrow frequency range images uncover reflectors in one frequency range that are masked in another range. Furthermore, the images enable for instance the characterization of the medium in terms of scatterer concentration and thus improve the structural interpretation. The analysis of these images might help to distinguish between small-scale structures in the high-frequency band and large-scale structures in the low-frequency band. We call this imaging approach Reflection Image Spectroscopy (RIS). We applied the RIS approach to the ANCORP'96 data set, an onshore deep seismic reflection profile across the South American Central Andes. The narrow frequency range images revealed additional details that we interpret as features directly linked to fluid migration processes in the subduction zone. Furthermore, structural details of the oceanic crust and the overlying mantle and crust are revealed. From the narrow-frequency range images we interpret that the top of the so called Nazca reflector at 70 km depth marks the upper limit of the hydrated mantle wedge, whereas the bottom of the reflector represents the top of the subducted oceanic crust. The compilation of our results with local earthquake data confirms this interpretation. Similar features observed in another deep seismic profile (PRECORP'95) support this interpretation, too. Furthermore, the RIS images show a highly reflective heterogeneous zone between the Nazca reflector at 70 km depth and a prominent mid-crustal Bright Spot (Quebrada Blanca Bright Spot) at about 30 km depth. We associate this zone with a complex network of ascending fluids or partial melts, initiated by ascending fluids released from the subducted oceanic plate. This observation links the Quebrada Bright Spot directly to the dehydrating oceanic plate.Reflection Image Spectroscopy across the Andean subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction Zones: Structure and Deformation History - ScienceDirectSubduction Zones: Structure and Deformation History - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction zone metamorphic pathway for deep carbon cycling: I.

ScienceDirect3 ways that new subduction zones formed are presented: polarity reversal, transform collapse, and plume margin collapse.Subduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectFuture advances in both 2D and 3D numerical modeling expectedSubduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectHow new subduction zones form is an emerging field of scientific research with important implications for our understanding of lithospheric strength, the driving force of plate tectonics, and Earth's tectonic history. We are making good progress towards understanding how new subduction zones form by combining field studies to identify candidates and reconstruct their timing and magmatic evolution and undertaking numerical modeling (informed by rheological constraints) to test hypotheses. Here, we review the state of the art by combining and comparing results coming from natural observations and numerical models of SI. Two modes of subduction initiation (SI) can be identified in both nature and models, spontaneous and induced. Induced SI occurs when pre-existing plate convergence causes a new subduction zone to form whereas spontaneous SI occurs without pre-existing plate motion when large lateral density contrasts occur across profound lithospheric weaknesses of various origin. We have good natural examples of 3 modes of subduction initiation, one type by induced nucleation of a subduction zone (polarity reversal) and two types of spontaneous nucleation of a subduction zone (transform collapse and plumehead margin collapse). In contrast, two proposed types of subduction initiation are not well supported by natural observations: (induced) transference and (spontaneous) passive margin collapse. Further work is therefore needed to expand on and understand the implications of these observations. Our future advancing understanding of SI will come from better geologic insights, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, and with improving communications between these communities.Subduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (205KB)Download full-size imageSubduction initiation in nature and models: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction rate of the primordial anorthosite and KREEP crust is evaluated.Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction channel is modeled by 1-D finite difference method.Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (347KB)Download full-size imageSubduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).Subduction of the primordial crust into the deep mantle - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Kyushu, 744 Motooka, Nishi-ku, Fukuoka 819-0395, Japan.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectThe role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectSubduction-induced mantle flow provides the key force to trigger breakup of continents.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectTimescale and location of breakup depend on the style of subduction.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectMarginal basins form when subduction is upper mantle confined.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectLower mantle subduction localises extension in continental interiors.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectModeling results reconciles Pangaea dismembering.The role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectThe role of deep subduction in supercontinent breakup - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamics of the Ryukyu/Izu-Bonin-Marianas double subduction system - ScienceDirectDynamics of the Ryukyu/Izu-Bonin-Marianas double subduction system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectSeismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectRecent findings on seismic imaging of Asian orogens and subduction zones.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectAnisotropic tomography provides new insight into continental tectonics and mantle dynamics.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectNew results on seismotectonics and intraplate volcanism.Seismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectSeismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (407KB)Download full-size imageSeismic imaging of the Asian orogens and subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectWhy primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectWe calculated the rheological structure of oceanic plate in Archean.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectThe plate strength in Archean was much smaller than that of present-day Earth.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectMore subduction zones had existed in Hadean and Archean.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectThe primordial continents were carried into deep mantle by tectonic erosion.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectGeological observations indicate that there are only a few rocks of Archean Earth and no Hadean rocks on the surface of the present-day Earth. From these facts, many scientists believe that the primordial continents never existed during Hadean Earth, and the continental volume has kept increasing. On the other hand, recent studies reported the importance of the primordial continents on the origin of life, implying their existence. In this paper, we discussed the possible process that could explain the loss of the primordial continents with the assumption that they existed in the Hadean. Although depending on the timing of the initiation of plate tectonics and its convection style, subduction erosion, which is observed on the present-day Earth, might have carried the primordial continents into the deep mantle.Why primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (284KB)Download full-size imageWhy primordial continents were recycled to the deep: Role of subduction erosion - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).Time-reversibility in seismic sequences: Application to the seismicity of Mexican subduction zone - ScienceDirect

ScienceDirectModel calculations verify the geochemical transfer from the subducting crust to the mantle.Continental basalts record the crust-mantle interaction in oceanic subduction channel: A geochemical case study from eastern China - ScienceDirectThe depleted MORB mantle dominates the budget of major elements in continental basalts.Continental basalts record the crust-mantle interaction in oceanic subduction channel: A geochemical case study from eastern China - ScienceDirectCrustal components dominate the budget of incompatible trace elements and radiogenic isotopes in continental basalts.Continental basalts record the crust-mantle interaction in oceanic subduction channel: A geochemical case study from eastern China - ScienceDirectContinental basalts, erupted in either flood or rift mode, usually show oceanic island basalts (OIB)-like geochemical compositions. Although their depletion in Sr-Nd isotope compositions is normally ascribed to contributions from the asthenospheric mantle, their enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE) is generally associated with variable enrichments in the Sr-Nd isotope compositions. This indicates significant contributions from crustal components such as igneous oceanic crust, lower continental crust and seafloor sediment. Nevertheless, these crustal components were not incorporated into the mantle sources of continental basalts in the form of solidus rocks. Instead they were processed into metasomatic agents through low-degree partial melting in order to have the geochemical fractionation of the largest extent to achieve the enrichment of LILE and LREE in the metasomatic agents. Therefore, the mantle sources of continental basalts were generated by metasomatic reaction of the depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) mantle with hydrous felsic melts. Nevertheless, mass balance considerations indicate differential contributions from the mantle and crustal components to the basalts. While the depleted MORB mantle predominates the budget of major elements, the crustal components predominate the budget of melt-mobile incompatible trace elements and their pertinent radiogenic isotopes. These considerations are verified by model calculations that are composed of four steps in an ancient oceanic subduction channel: (1) dehydration of the subducting crustal rocks at subarc depths, (2) anataxis of the dehydrated rocks at postarc depths, (3) metasomatic reaction of the depleted MORB mantle peridotite with the felsic melts to generate ultramafic metasomatites in the lower part of the mantle wedge, and (4) partial melting of the metasomatites for basaltic magmatism. The composition of metasomatites is quantitatively dictated by the crustal metasomatism through melt-peridotite reaction at the slab-mantle interface in oceanic subduction channels. Continental basalts of Mesozoic to Cenozoic ages from eastern China are used as a case example to illustrate the above petrogenetic mechanism. Subduction of the paleo-Pacific oceanic slab beneath the eastern edge of Eurasian continent in the Early Mesozoic would have transferred the crustal signatures into the mantle sources of these basalts. This process would be associated with rollback of the subducting slab at that time, whereas the partial melting of metasomatites takes place mainly in the Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic to produce the continental basalts. Therefore, OIB-like continental basalts are also the product of subduction-zone magmatism though they occur in intraplate settings.Continental basalts record the crust-mantle interaction in oceanic subduction channel: A geochemical case study from eastern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectTracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectTianshan eclogites were interacted with two fluid components during exhumation.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-LILEs component is likely released from mica-group minerals.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-LILEs component contains a significant amount of isotopically heavy Mg.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-Pb component is possibly dehydrated from epidote-group minerals.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectThe high-Pb component contains too little Mg so as not to influence the eclogites.Tracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectTracing subduction zone fluid-rock interactions using trace element and Mg-Sr-Nd isotopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectPartial melting of MORB-derived garnet amphibolites and generation of trondhjemite.Hot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (485KB)Download full-size imageHot subduction in the middle Jurassic and partial melting of oceanic crust in Chilean Patagonia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectDynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectComposition and rheology of the oceanic plateau control its accretion modes.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectSlab age and seaward overriding plate motion dominate the subduction angle and style.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectJurassic crustal growth in the Lhasa Terrane needs bottom accretion of oceanic plateaus.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectFlat to steep subduction transition explains magmatic distribution in the Lhasa Terrane.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectThe oceanic plateau subduction and resulted terrane accretion have played significant roles in the continental crustal growth; however, the modes and dynamics of plateau accretion during subduction remains poorly understood. The oceanic subduction can be driven by the combined effects of slab pull, ridge push, as well as the possible overriding plate push. The latter one has been rarely studied, but can be the case during the multiple Tethyan slabs subduction and terranes accretion for the formation of Tibetan lithosphere in the Mesozoic. Using 2-D petrological-thermo-mechanical models, we systematically investigated the modes and dynamics of terrane accretion during the dominant seaward continental drifting and oceanic plateau subduction. The model results show that the plateau with continental crustal affinity favors accretion to the overriding plate during the subduction process. Three distinct terrane accretion modes are identified: frontal accretion, bottom accretion, and a transitional mode with both the frontal and bottom accretion. In contrast, the plateau with oceanic crustal affinity generally favors subduction and recycling into the deeper mantle, rather than accretion, which is mainly due to the higher density and possible eclogitization of the oceanic crustal materials during subduction. The numerical simulations further reveal that the controlling factor for the subduction style, i.e. flat versus steep subduction, is the age of the oceanic slab and the seaward overriding plate motion. The rheological properties and the convergence rate play minor roles in affecting the subducting slab angle. The model results are further compared with the Jurassic magmatic rock distribution and geochemical characteristics of the Lhasa Terrane in Tibet, which reveals (1) the transition from flat to steep subduction of the southward Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan slab; and (2) the mechanism of Jurassic crustal growth in the central Lhasa subterrane which may be strongly correlated with the bottom accretion of the subducted oceanic plateau.Dynamics of terrane accretion during seaward continental drifting and oceanic subduction: Numerical modeling and implications for the Jurassic crustal growth of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Speculations on the impact of catastrophic subduction initiation on the Earth System - ScienceDirectThe physics of subduction initiation can be studied with numerical models of lithosphere dynamics, to the extent where we can now test the potential consequences of a catastrophic subduction initiation event on the Earth System. The South American Atlantic passive margin is here used to show that, once subduction has catastrophically initiated there, a major geodynamic reconfiguration of the South American plate (SAm) is likely to take place: (1) compression in the east will be inverted to extension, because ridge push will be replaced by subduction rollback and trench retreat; (2) compression in the west will be inverted to extension due to absolute rollback; and (3) without buttressing from the east and west, the Andes will collapse. Extension at both margins of continental SAm will produce two new volcanic arcs, several thousands of kilometres long each, bounded by trenches and two new back-arc basins. The spreading rate of the Mid-Atlantic Rift will significantly increase, because of the cumulative effect of ridge-push and slab-pull in the same direction. The substantially increased volcanism all around SAm and in the MAR will most likely release massive amounts of greenhouse and (toxic) gases into the atmosphere and oceans, which might lead to major oceanic and atmospheric circulation changes. We present new numerical modelling that supports the proposed evolution of the SAm after subduction has catastrophically initiated at its eastern passive margin.Speculations on the impact of catastrophic subduction initiation on the Earth System -

ScienceDirectThe plate motion was related to tectonic events in SW Japan and Taiwan.Differential subsidence of the forearc wedge of the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc caused by subduction of ridges on the Philippine Sea Plate - ScienceDirectThe Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) carrying several ridges has been sudbucting under the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc since middle Miocene. Because no extensive accretionary prism has been growing along the Ryukyu Trench, the arc provides an opportunity to examine effects of ridge subduction on structure of the forearc wedge and a clue to reconstruct ancient plate motion of the PSP that is inferred to have changed between NW and NNW. To examine this perspective, we clarified structure of the Ryukyu forearc wedge based on seismic profiles and bathymetric data and related them to ridge subduction. An erosional unconformity between pre-Neogen and Neogene rocks is widely recognized through the Ryukyu Arc, and we divided the forearc wedges into Zones I to IV from southwest to northeast by difference of depth of the erosional unconformity. We correlated these four zones to the locations of ridge subduction that have been shifting NE or SW along the Ryukyu Trench. Zone I is underlain by the largely subsided unconformity and we attributed the structure to tearing of the Eurasia plate due to subduction of the western margin of the PSP including the Luzon Arc. Zone II consists of a wide terrace on the shallow erosional unconformity, and no ridge that was subducting in this zone is known. Zone III is characterized by the seaward descending unconformity covered with a thick sequence of Neogene sediments and is related to subduction of the NW-SE trending Daito Ridge and the E-W trending Amami Plateau. Zone IV has the deeper unconformity and slope geometry and corresponds to subduction of the NNW-SSE trending Kyushu-Palau Ridge. The structure of the Ryukyu forearc is consistently related to subduction of ridges on the PSP, suggesting that the change of the plate motion of the PSP can be precisely reconstructed by further detailed survey.Differential subsidence of the forearc wedge of the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc caused by subduction of ridges on the Philippine Sea Plate - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNumerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectWe present self-consistent subduction models with non-linear rheologies.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectBoth the thickness of overriding plate and the thermal age of slab are investigated.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThick upper plate increases the flexural wavelength and its magnitude.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectModels show that fundamental force balance of subduction depends on buoyancy.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThe mechanical strength of the oceanic lithospheres exerts a fundamental control on the dynamics and tectonics of convergent margins. Here, we use numerical models of coupled subducting-upper plates and mantle to investigate the impact of the subducting lithosphere properties on the parameters commonly measured at subduction zones. The models predict a correlation among parameters such as subducting and convergence velocities, slab dip and curvature, and stress coupling with the upper plates, such signature emerges in a dynamic system through the slab buoyancy. Similar trends are found when assessing the impact of laboratory-constrained non-linear rheologies uncertainties on the mechanical strength and mantle flow, although some features are more affected. When the role of upper plate thickness is tested, we find a positive correlation of upper plate subsidence and fore-arc topography with the buoyancy of the down-going plate. However, plasticity in the crust limits the development of topography, becoming increasingly relevant with thinner upper plates, so that no correlation can be established. Similar control is found on the width of the long-wavelength dynamic subsidence, due to flexure, which increases non-linearly with the upper plate thickness. The models constrain relations among parameters within the dynamic system driven that allow inferences on the observable parameters. The comparisons supports the idea that the subduction dynamics emerges as a global phenomenon in plate motions, bending and dynamic subsidence, yet Andean-type margin tectonics is best addressed in a regional context.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNow at: Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, Science Labs, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGlobal correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectCorrelating 24 subduction parameters and maximum earthquakes at subduction zones.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGlobal correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectEpicenters of giant earthquakes only occur at compressive/neutral overriding plates.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGiant earthquakes might be triggered at normal stress asperities on interface.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGiant earthquakes require gentle thrust dip, slow trench motion and flat interface.Global correlations between maximum magnitudes of subduction zone interface thrust earthquakes and physical parameters of subduction zones - ScienceDirectMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectCharacterisation of zircon grains in serpentinites, pyroxenites and rodingitesMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (495KB)Download full-size imageMagmatic and metasomatic imprints in a long-lasting subduction zone: Evidence from zircon in rodingite and serpentinite of Kochi, SW Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectThe thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectIncoming geotherm contributes significant uncertainty to shallow thermal models of subduction.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectUpdip limit of seismicity is generally shallower at erosive margins than accretionary margins.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectFrictional heating reconciles thermal structure of margins with updip limit of seismicity.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectWe investigate differences in the thermal structure of the subduction thrust between accretionary and erosive margins using a finite element model. Global averages of plate margin geometries, sediment thickness, plate age, and convergence rate are used to construct generic models of accretionary and erosive margins. Of these parameters, our analysis shows that the largest uncertainty in these models is the geotherm for the incoming oceanic plate. Despite these uncertainties, the subduction thrust of similarly aged accretionary margins is slightly warmer than erosive margins primarily due to the effect of sediment insulating the subduction thrust at accretionary margins. If the updip limit of seismicity is thermally controlled, warmer accretionary margins suggest shallower seismogenic updip limits, counter to the observation that erosional margins are more likely to generate tsunamigenic earthquakes. This discrepancy can be reconciled if frictional heat generation at erosive margins is larger than at accretionary margins.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectSeismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectSeismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectReveal the internal fine structure of the MTZ beneath the northeastern South China Sea using the high sensitive triplication method.Seismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectA high-velocity anomaly is found in the mantle transition zone.Seismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectPropose that new geodynamic model that the high-velocity anomaly in the MTZ was caused by the broken fragments from the high angle diving oceanic plate falling into the MTZ, and/or by the unstable thick continental lithosphere dropping into the MTZ sequentially or almost simultaneously.

- ScienceDirectU-series disequilibria in subduction zone lavas: Inherited from subducted slabs or produced by mantle in-growth melting? - ScienceDirectWith appropriate parameters applied, in-growth melting in the mantle followed by modification in the crust can provide a self-consistent explanation of the U-series disequilibria and the relationships with other geochemical signatures in most subduction zone lavas except the few Tonga-Kermadec lavas with slight 231Pa deficit. On the basis of melting experiments of hydrous peridotites, we further propose that most mantle-derived melts and thus U-series disequilibria should be mainly produced by melting in the hot zone of the mantle wedge, as controlled by thermal structure of the convergent margins. In order to produce enough short-lived nuclides, the timescales of mass transfer and magmatism in the subduction zone should at least range from a few to a few hundred millennia. Future studies on more lavas, numerical modelling, and partition coefficients of U-series nuclides will help for better application of U-series disequilibria into subduction zone magmatism.U-series disequilibria in subduction zone lavas: Inherited from subducted slabs or produced by mantle in-growth melting?

While the formation of subduction-related porphyries is quite well understood, collisional metallogeny is more complex, and may involve a number of different processes or sources. These include melting of: orogenically thickened crust; previously subduction-modified lithosphere (including metasomatized mantle, underplated mafic rocks, or lower crustal arc plutons and cumulates); or upwelling asthenosphere (e.g., in response to delamination, slab breakoff, back-arc extension, or orogenic collapse).Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision -

ScienceDirectThe tectonic and topographic evolution of southeast Asia is attributed to the indentation of India into Eurasia, gravitational collapse of the uplifted terrains and the dynamics of the Sunda and other western Pacific subduction zones, but their relative contributions remain elusive. Here, we analyse 3D numerical geodynamic modelling results involving a collision-subduction system and show that vigorous asthenospheric flow due to differential along-strike slab kinematics may contribute to the surface strain and elevations at collision-subduction transition zones. We argue that protracted northward migration of the collisional front and Indian slab during south to south-westward rollback subduction along the Sunda margin might have produced a similar asthenospheric flow. This flow could have contributed to the southeast Asia extrusion tectonics and uplift of the terrains around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and protruding from southeast Tibet. Therefore, we suggest that the tectonics and topographic growth east and southeast of Tibet are controlled not only by crustal and lithospheric deformation but also by asthenospheric dynamics.On the influence of the asthenospheric flow on the tectonics and topography at a collision-subduction transition zones: Comparison with the eastern Tibetan margin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectShallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThis study characterizes subduction related seismicity using the MARS deployment.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThrust mechanisms inland of the 2003 rupture zone suggest a shallow Rivera plate.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectSlab surface contours outline the inland extent of the shallow Rivera plate.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectSeismicity is spatially anti-correlated with non-volcanic tremor.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectInterplate seismicity in the proposed 1973 rupture zone appears to be persistent.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThis study characterizes subduction related seismicity with local deployments along the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone where 4 portions of the plate interface have ruptured in 1973, 1985, 1995, and 2003. It has been proposed that the subducted boundary between the Cocos and Rivera plates occurs beneath this region, as indicated by inland volcanic activity, a gap in tectonic tremor, and the Manzanillo Trough and Colima Graben, which are depressions thought to be associated with the splitting of the two plates after subduction. Data from 50 broadband stations that comprised the MARS seismic array, deployed from January 2006 to June 2007, were processed with the software program Antelope and its generalized source location algorithm, genloc, to detect and locate earthquakes within the network. Slab surface depth contours from the resulting catalog indicate a change in subduction trajectory between the Rivera and Cocos plates. The earthquake locations are spatially anti-correlated with tectonic tremor, supporting the idea that they represent different types of fault slip. Hypocentral patterns also reveal areas of more intense seismic activity (clusters) that appear to be associated with the 2003 and 1973 megathrust rupture regions. Seismicity concentrated inland of the 2003 rupture is consistent with slip on a shallowly dipping trajectory for the Rivera plate interface as opposed to crustal faulting in the overriding North American plate. A prominent cluster of seismicity within the suspected 1973 rupture zone appears to be a commonly active portion of the megathrust as it has been active during three previous deployments. We support these interpretations by determining focal mechanisms and detailed relocations of the largest events within the 1973 and inland 2003 clusters, which indicate primarily thrust mechanisms near the plate interface.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (307KB)Download full-size imageShallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectNow at GNS Science, Lower Hutt, New Zealand.Geochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis - ScienceDirectGeochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis - ScienceDirectIn subduction-related Cu porphyry magmas, the oxidation state (fO2), the concentrations of chalcophile metals, and other volatiles (e.g., S and Cl), and the abundance of water were directly controlled by the composition of the primary arc basaltic magma. In contrast, the high Cu concentrations and fO2 values of collision-related Cu porphyry magmas were indirectly derived from subduction modified magmas, and the large amount of water and other volatiles in these magmas were controlled in part by partial melting of amphibolite derived from arc basalts that were underplated beneath the lower crust, and in part by the contribution from the rising potassic and ultrapotassic magmas. Both subduction- and collision-related porphyries are enriched in potassium, and were associated with crustal thickening. Their high K2O contents were primarily as a result of the inheritance of enriched mantle components and/or mixing with contemporaneous ultrapotassic magmas.Geochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis -

ScienceDirectThe plate motion was related to tectonic events in SW Japan and Taiwan.Differential subsidence of the forearc wedge of the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc caused by subduction of ridges on the Philippine Sea Plate - ScienceDirectThe Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) carrying several ridges has been sudbucting under the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc since middle Miocene. Because no extensive accretionary prism has been growing along the Ryukyu Trench, the arc provides an opportunity to examine effects of ridge subduction on structure of the forearc wedge and a clue to reconstruct ancient plate motion of the PSP that is inferred to have changed between NW and NNW. To examine this perspective, we clarified structure of the Ryukyu forearc wedge based on seismic profiles and bathymetric data and related them to ridge subduction. An erosional unconformity between pre-Neogen and Neogene rocks is widely recognized through the Ryukyu Arc, and we divided the forearc wedges into Zones I to IV from southwest to northeast by difference of depth of the erosional unconformity. We correlated these four zones to the locations of ridge subduction that have been shifting NE or SW along the Ryukyu Trench. Zone I is underlain by the largely subsided unconformity and we attributed the structure to tearing of the Eurasia plate due to subduction of the western margin of the PSP including the Luzon Arc. Zone II consists of a wide terrace on the shallow erosional unconformity, and no ridge that was subducting in this zone is known. Zone III is characterized by the seaward descending unconformity covered with a thick sequence of Neogene sediments and is related to subduction of the NW-SE trending Daito Ridge and the E-W trending Amami Plateau. Zone IV has the deeper unconformity and slope geometry and corresponds to subduction of the NNW-SSE trending Kyushu-Palau Ridge. The structure of the Ryukyu forearc is consistently related to subduction of ridges on the PSP, suggesting that the change of the plate motion of the PSP can be precisely reconstructed by further detailed survey.Differential subsidence of the forearc wedge of the Ryukyu (Nansei-Shoto) Arc caused by subduction of ridges on the Philippine Sea Plate - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNumerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectWe present self-consistent subduction models with non-linear rheologies.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectBoth the thickness of overriding plate and the thermal age of slab are investigated.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThick upper plate increases the flexural wavelength and its magnitude.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectModels show that fundamental force balance of subduction depends on buoyancy.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectThe mechanical strength of the oceanic lithospheres exerts a fundamental control on the dynamics and tectonics of convergent margins. Here, we use numerical models of coupled subducting-upper plates and mantle to investigate the impact of the subducting lithosphere properties on the parameters commonly measured at subduction zones. The models predict a correlation among parameters such as subducting and convergence velocities, slab dip and curvature, and stress coupling with the upper plates, such signature emerges in a dynamic system through the slab buoyancy. Similar trends are found when assessing the impact of laboratory-constrained non-linear rheologies uncertainties on the mechanical strength and mantle flow, although some features are more affected. When the role of upper plate thickness is tested, we find a positive correlation of upper plate subsidence and fore-arc topography with the buoyancy of the down-going plate. However, plasticity in the crust limits the development of topography, becoming increasingly relevant with thinner upper plates, so that no correlation can be established. Similar control is found on the width of the long-wavelength dynamic subsidence, due to flexure, which increases non-linearly with the upper plate thickness. The models constrain relations among parameters within the dynamic system driven that allow inferences on the observable parameters. The comparisons supports the idea that the subduction dynamics emerges as a global phenomenon in plate motions, bending and dynamic subsidence, yet Andean-type margin tectonics is best addressed in a regional context.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical modeling of stress and topography coupling during subduction: Inferences on global vs. regional observables interpretation - ScienceDirectNow at: Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, Science Labs, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectThe coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectGlobal tomography evidences Indian continent subduction and breakoff.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectAfter complete breakoff at the OCT, Indian continent subduction resumes.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectMantle flow generates by oceanic subduction drags the Indian continent in the mantle.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectIndian slab breakoff generated localized stress pulses in Asian continent.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectIn order to understand the potential controls on Asian tectonics during the subduction of the Tethys and Indian lithospheres, we reconstruct the coupled subduction-continent deformation history using tomographic imaging, kinematics constraints and numerical modeling.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectThe coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectThe coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageThe coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectThe coupling of Indian subduction and Asian continental tectonics - ScienceDirectFabio Antonio Capitanio is a Senior Lecturer at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

ScienceDirectIncoming geotherm contributes significant uncertainty to shallow thermal models of subduction.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectUpdip limit of seismicity is generally shallower at erosive margins than accretionary margins.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectFrictional heating reconciles thermal structure of margins with updip limit of seismicity.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectWe investigate differences in the thermal structure of the subduction thrust between accretionary and erosive margins using a finite element model. Global averages of plate margin geometries, sediment thickness, plate age, and convergence rate are used to construct generic models of accretionary and erosive margins. Of these parameters, our analysis shows that the largest uncertainty in these models is the geotherm for the incoming oceanic plate. Despite these uncertainties, the subduction thrust of similarly aged accretionary margins is slightly warmer than erosive margins primarily due to the effect of sediment insulating the subduction thrust at accretionary margins. If the updip limit of seismicity is thermally controlled, warmer accretionary margins suggest shallower seismogenic updip limits, counter to the observation that erosional margins are more likely to generate tsunamigenic earthquakes. This discrepancy can be reconciled if frictional heat generation at erosive margins is larger than at accretionary margins.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The thermal structure of the subduction thrust within accretionary and erosive margins - ScienceDirectSeismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectSeismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectReveal the internal fine structure of the MTZ beneath the northeastern South China Sea using the high sensitive triplication method.Seismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectA high-velocity anomaly is found in the mantle transition zone.Seismic triplication used to reveal slab subduction that had disappeared in the late Mesozoic beneath the northeastern South China Sea - ScienceDirectPropose that new geodynamic model that the high-velocity anomaly in the MTZ was caused by the broken fragments from the high angle diving oceanic plate falling into the MTZ, and/or by the unstable thick continental lithosphere dropping into the MTZ sequentially or almost simultaneously.

ScienceDirectU-series disequilibria in subduction zone lavas: Inherited from subducted slabs or produced by mantle in-growth melting? - ScienceDirectWith appropriate parameters applied, in-growth melting in the mantle followed by modification in the crust can provide a self-consistent explanation of the U-series disequilibria and the relationships with other geochemical signatures in most subduction zone lavas except the few Tonga-Kermadec lavas with slight 231Pa deficit. On the basis of melting experiments of hydrous peridotites, we further propose that most mantle-derived melts and thus U-series disequilibria should be mainly produced by melting in the hot zone of the mantle wedge, as controlled by thermal structure of the convergent margins. In order to produce enough short-lived nuclides, the timescales of mass transfer and magmatism in the subduction zone should at least range from a few to a few hundred millennia. Future studies on more lavas, numerical modelling, and partition coefficients of U-series nuclides will help for better application of U-series disequilibria into subduction zone magmatism.U-series disequilibria in subduction zone lavas: Inherited from subducted slabs or produced by mantle in-growth melting? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Early Carboniferous adakite-like and I-type granites in central Qiangtang, northern Tibet: Implications for intra-oceanic subduction and back-arc basin formation within the Paleo-Tethys Ocean - ScienceDirectEarly Carboniferous adakite-like and I-type granites in central Qiangtang, northern Tibet: Implications for intra-oceanic subduction and back-arc basin formation within the Paleo-Tethys Ocean - ScienceDirectThe syenogranites were formed by partial melting of the oceanic crust above the mantle wedge.Early Carboniferous adakite-like and I-type granites in central Qiangtang, northern Tibet: Implications for intra-oceanic subduction and back-arc basin formation within the Paleo-Tethys Ocean - ScienceDirectThe Paleo-Tethys Ocean was characterized by intra-oceanic subduction and back-arc basin during the Early Carboniferous.Early Carboniferous adakite-like and I-type granites in central Qiangtang, northern Tibet: Implications for intra-oceanic subduction and back-arc basin formation within the Paleo-Tethys Ocean - ScienceDirectAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectTwo magmatic arcs on the opposing overriding Lhasa and Qiangtang terranesAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectAbsence of Early Cretaceous high-grade metamorphic rocksAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectDivergent double-sided subduction of the Bangong oceanic lithosphereAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectThe Moho in subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe Moho in subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe Moho in subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectFlip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectTectonic convergence across the Mediterranean induces fragmentation into micro-plates.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectReversal of subduction polarity across the Phoenician basin.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectEastern Cyprus Arc subduction cessation shifts to North Levant margin re-activation.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectRare modern example for subduction nucleation across the northern Levant margin.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectFlip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageFlip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Flip convergence across the Phoenician basin through nucleation of subduction - ScienceDirectUri Schattner is a senior lecturer in marine geosciences, co-founder and former head of the Moses Strauss Dept. of Marine Geosciences, head of SeisLab for seismic interpretation.

This redox reaction might be coupled with the oxidation of reduced oceanic phases such as sulfides, and the formation of oxidized fluids (e.g. SOX, H2O, COX). At greater depths, the beginning of antigorite dehydration leads to an increase of Fe3+/FeTotal in relict antigorite, in agreement with the preferential partitioning of ferric iron into serpentine rather than into olivine.Evolution of Fe redox state in serpentine during subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectHigh interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectDetecting low amplitude deformation due to subduction coupling from InSAR data.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectCombining corrections for non-tectonic sources in InSAR (e.g. tides and troposphere).High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectGround deformation reveals high interseismic coupling in eastern Makran.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectInferring lateral variations of interseismic coupling.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectEvaluating potential for large subduction earthquakes and tsunami.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectEstimating the extent of interseismic coupling along subduction zone megathrusts is essential for quantitative assessments of seismic and tsunami hazards. Up to now, quantifying the seismogenic potential of the eastern Makran subduction zone at the northern edge of the Indian ocean has remained elusive due to a paucity of geodetic observations. Furthermore, non-tectonic processes obscure the signature of accumulating elastic strain. Historical earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 7 have been reported. In particular, the 1945 Mw 8.1 earthquake resulted in a significant tsunami that swept the shores of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. A quantitative estimate of elastic strain accumulation along the subduction plate boundary in eastern Makran is needed to confront previous indirect and contradictory conclusions about the seismic potential in the region. Here, we infer the distribution of interseismic coupling on the eastern Makran megathrust from time series of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images acquired between 2003 and 2010, applying a consistent series of corrections to extract the low amplitude, long wavelength deformation signal associated with elastic strain on the megathrust. We find high interseismic coupling (i.e. the megathrust does not slip and elastic strain accumulates) in the central section of eastern Makran, where the 1945 earthquake occurred, while lower coupling coincides spatially with the subduction of the Sonne Fault Zone. The inferred accumulation of elastic strain since the 1945 earthquake is consistent with the future occurrence of magnitude 7+ earthquakes and we cannot exclude the possibility of a multi-segment rupture (Mw 8+). However, the likelihood for such scenarios might be modulated by partitioning of plate convergence between slip on the megathrust and internal deformation of the overlying, actively deforming, accretionary wedge.High interseismic coupling in the Eastern Makran (Pakistan) subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectThe tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic history of the Tethys orogen is reviewed.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectFew rocks and mineral deposits survive from the Paleotethys.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectSome deposits are subduction-related, but many are collision-related.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectCollisional deposits are formed by remobilization of subduction-modified lithosphere.Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectTectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision - ScienceDirectOver the last decade, improved geochronological constraints on the timing of ore formation and key tectonic events have revealed that many porphyry deposits that were previously assumed to be subduction-related are in fact broadly collision-related, some forming in back-arc settings in advance of collision, some during collision, and others during post-collisional processes such as orogenic collapse and/or delamination of subcontinental mantle lithosphere. While the formation of subduction-related porphyries is quite well understood, collisional metallogeny is more complex, and may involve a number of different processes or sources. These include melting of: orogenically thickened crust; previously subduction-modified lithosphere (including metasomatized mantle, underplated mafic rocks, or lower crustal arc plutons and cumulates); or upwelling asthenosphere (e.g., in response to delamination, slab breakoff, back-arc extension, or orogenic collapse).Tectonic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Tethyan orogen: From subduction to collision -

Subduction introduces oxidised Fe, C and S in sediments, altered ocean crust, and partially serpentinised lithospheric mantle to the relatively reduced mantle, with short- and long-term consequences for the redox state of the mantle. The distribution of redox-sensitive elements in the mantle controls the redox state of mantle-derived material added to the lithosphere and atmosphere, such as arc volcanic gases and the magmas that form arc-related ore deposits.The redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThus, inputs into subduction zones for Fe, C, S and redox budget are in excess of subduction zone outputs. If MORB and plume-related fluxes are taken into account then Fe, C and S fluxes balance, within error. However, the redox budget does not balance, unless the very lowest estimates for the extent of slab oxidation are taken. Thus it is likely that subduction continuously increases the redox budget of the mantle, that is, there is addition of Fe, C and S that are oxidised relative to the Fe, C and S in the mantle.The redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe redox budget of subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectSINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectDipping sub-Moho reflections are imaged beneath Sichuan Basin from SINOPROBE.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectThe sub-Moho reflections are interpreted as relict subduction.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectRelict subduction is Neo-Proterozoic age given nearby geochemical evidence.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectDebate about South China tectonic accretion may be solved by this study.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectPresence and preservation of fossil subduction shows strength of Sichuan lithosphere.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectA new multichannel seismic reflection profile collected across the Sichuan Basin in southern China by SINOPROBE images prominent reflectors that originate within the lower crust and penetrate well into the underlying mantle. The geometry of these mantle reflectors is very similar to those observed on other deep reflection profiles that have been interpreted as relicts of ancient subduction. Considering the geological history of the basement beneath and surrounding Sichuan Basin and ages of granites encountered in nearby wells, we propose that these newly revealed reflectors are the remnants of Neo-Proterozoic subduction that occurred along the NW margin of the Yangtze Craton. This interpretation is consistent with geochemical studies from a gneissic complex at the west margin of the Sichuan Basin. Moreover, preservation of these reflectors supports the idea that the Sichuan lithosphere served as a consolidated tectonic buttress against which the Tibetan Plateau has impinged to produce the Longmenshan orogenic belt.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.SINOPROBE deep reflection profile reveals a Neo-Proterozoic subduction zone beneath Sichuan Basin - ScienceDirectPreviously at Cornell University, United States.On the influence of the asthenospheric flow on the tectonics and topography at a collision-subduction transition zones: Comparison with the eastern Tibetan margin - ScienceDirectThe tectonic and topographic evolution of southeast Asia is attributed to the indentation of India into Eurasia, gravitational collapse of the uplifted terrains and the dynamics of the Sunda and other western Pacific subduction zones, but their relative contributions remain elusive. Here, we analyse 3D numerical geodynamic modelling results involving a collision-subduction system and show that vigorous asthenospheric flow due to differential along-strike slab kinematics may contribute to the surface strain and elevations at collision-subduction transition zones. We argue that protracted northward migration of the collisional front and Indian slab during south to south-westward rollback subduction along the Sunda margin might have produced a similar asthenospheric flow. This flow could have contributed to the southeast Asia extrusion tectonics and uplift of the terrains around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and protruding from southeast Tibet. Therefore, we suggest that the tectonics and topographic growth east and southeast of Tibet are controlled not only by crustal and lithospheric deformation but also by asthenospheric dynamics.On the influence of the asthenospheric flow on the tectonics and topography at a collision-subduction transition zones: Comparison with the eastern Tibetan margin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectShallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThis study characterizes subduction related seismicity using the MARS deployment.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThrust mechanisms inland of the 2003 rupture zone suggest a shallow Rivera plate.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectSlab surface contours outline the inland extent of the shallow Rivera plate.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectSeismicity is spatially anti-correlated with non-volcanic tremor.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectInterplate seismicity in the proposed 1973 rupture zone appears to be persistent.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectThis study characterizes subduction related seismicity with local deployments along the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone where 4 portions of the plate interface have ruptured in 1973, 1985, 1995, and 2003. It has been proposed that the subducted boundary between the Cocos and Rivera plates occurs beneath this region, as indicated by inland volcanic activity, a gap in tectonic tremor, and the Manzanillo Trough and Colima Graben, which are depressions thought to be associated with the splitting of the two plates after subduction. Data from 50 broadband stations that comprised the MARS seismic array, deployed from January 2006 to June 2007, were processed with the software program Antelope and its generalized source location algorithm, genloc, to detect and locate earthquakes within the network. Slab surface depth contours from the resulting catalog indicate a change in subduction trajectory between the Rivera and Cocos plates. The earthquake locations are spatially anti-correlated with tectonic tremor, supporting the idea that they represent different types of fault slip. Hypocentral patterns also reveal areas of more intense seismic activity (clusters) that appear to be associated with the 2003 and 1973 megathrust rupture regions. Seismicity concentrated inland of the 2003 rupture is consistent with slip on a shallowly dipping trajectory for the Rivera plate interface as opposed to crustal faulting in the overriding North American plate. A prominent cluster of seismicity within the suspected 1973 rupture zone appears to be a commonly active portion of the megathrust as it has been active during three previous deployments. We support these interpretations by determining focal mechanisms and detailed relocations of the largest events within the 1973 and inland 2003 clusters, which indicate primarily thrust mechanisms near the plate interface.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (307KB)Download full-size imageShallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow seismicity patterns in the northwestern section of the Mexico Subduction Zone - ScienceDirectNow at GNS Science, Lower Hutt, New Zealand.Geochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis - ScienceDirectGeochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis - ScienceDirectIn subduction-related Cu porphyry magmas, the oxidation state (fO2), the concentrations of chalcophile metals, and other volatiles (e.g., S and Cl), and the abundance of water were directly controlled by the composition of the primary arc basaltic magma. In contrast, the high Cu concentrations and fO2 values of collision-related Cu porphyry magmas were indirectly derived from subduction modified magmas, and the large amount of water and other volatiles in these magmas were controlled in part by partial melting of amphibolite derived from arc basalts that were underplated beneath the lower crust, and in part by the contribution from the rising potassic and ultrapotassic magmas. Both subduction- and collision-related porphyries are enriched in potassium, and were associated with crustal thickening. Their high K2O contents were primarily as a result of the inheritance of enriched mantle components and/or mixing with contemporaneous ultrapotassic magmas.Geochemical differences between subduction- and collision-related copper-bearing porphyries and implications for metallogenesis -

ScienceDirectThe Okinawa Trough is an infant back-arc basin developed along the Ryukyu arc. This paper provides new major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Li isotope data of volcanic rocks in the Okinawa Trough and combines the published geochemical data to discuss the composition of magma source, the influence of subduction component, and the contamination of crustal materials, and calculate the contribution between subduction sediment and altered oceanic crust in the subduction component. The results showed that there are 97% DM and 3% EMI component in the mantle source in middle trough (MS), which have been influenced by subduction sediment. The Li-Nd isotopes indicate that the contribution of subduction sediment and altered oceanic crust in subduction component are 4 and 96%, respectively. The intermediate-acidic rocks suffer from contamination of continental crust material in shallow magma chamber during fractional crystallization. The acidic rocks in south trough have experienced more contamination of crustal material than those from the middle and north trough segments.Geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb-Li isotopic characteristics of volcanic rocks from the Okinawa Trough: Implications for the influence of subduction components and the contamination of crustal materials - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectThree MBL volcanoes display Ba and Nd isotope anomalies unique to West Antarctica.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectNeither lithospheric contamination, nor mantle amphibole explains the anomalies.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectResidual subduction component contamination provides the best explanation.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe anomaly source is a fossil mantle diapir attached to the base of the lithosphere.Reconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectReconciling the shadow of a subduction signature with rift geochemistry and tectonic environment in Eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe apparent coincidence of these anomalies with the site of a pre-Cenozoic convergence zone along the Gondwanaland margin suggests a subduction influence.

The abundance of these elements provides information related to the fluid/rock interactions during serpentinization and the behavior of FME, from their incorporation to their gradual release during subduction. Serpentinites are considered as a reservoir of the FME in subduction zones and their role, notably on arc magma composition, is underestimated presently in the global geochemical cycle.Geochemistry of subduction zone serpentinites: A review - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageGeochemistry of subduction zone serpentinites: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectComplex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectA 3-D teleseismic P-wave tomography of the Eastern Himalayan SyntaxisComplex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectContrasting subduction modes (flat versus steep) in the eastern HimalayaComplex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectTearing of the subducting Indian slab and upwelling of the hot asthenospheric mantleComplex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography - ScienceDirectOn the eastern margin of the Himalayan orogenic belt, the rapid uplift of the Namche Barwa metamorphic terrane and significant bending of the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone occur. The formation mechanism and dynamics of the Eastern Himalaya Syntaxis (EHS) is still debated. In order to better understand the deep structures beneath the EHS, we deployed 35 broadband seismic stations around the Namche Barwa Mountain. The data were integrated with existing datasets for a 3-D teleseismic P-wave tomography. The results demonstrate complex deep structures and significantly contrasting Indian subduction styles in the eastern Himalaya. In the western region of the EHS, the Indian slab flatly subducts under southern Tibet and might extend to the Bangong-Nujiang Suture. In contrast, a (north)eastward steep subduction occurred in the eastern region of EHS. The contrasting subduction styles result in tearing and fragmentation of the Indian lithosphere between the flat and steep subducting slabs beneath the EHS. Consequently, the hot asthenospheric mantle may rise through the slab window, which might further lead to the rapid uplift of Namche Barwa and the formation of EHS. The lateral variation in subduction/collision mode and slab tearing induced asthenospheric mantle upwelling is similar to that observed in the Hellenide and Anatolide domains of the Tethyan orogen.Complex Indian subduction style with slab fragmentation beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis revealed by teleseismic P-wave tomography -

ScienceDirectFluid-mobile element (FME) systematics in serpentinites are key to unravel the environments of mantle rock hydration, dehydration, and element recycling in subduction zones. Here we compile serpentinite geochemical data and, for the first time, report discriminative FME enrichment trends for mid ocean ridge vs. forearc serpentinisation by applying alkali element-U ratios. Characteristic element fractionations are thereby governed by redox-dependent differential U mobility at mid ocean ridges and in forearcs, and by high Cs input in forearcs due to fluids equilibrated with sediments. Simple modelling reproduces the observed enrichment trends in serpentinites that range over several orders of magnitude. From these systematics, first constraints on potentially discriminative fractionation trends for unconventional fluid tracers such as B, As, and Sb can be deduced. Prominent W enrichments that correlate with FMEs suggest significant W mobility in low-temperature serpentinising environments.Fluid-mobile elements in serpentinites: Constraints on serpentinisation environments and element cycling in subduction zones - ScienceDirectFluid-mobile elements in serpentinites: Constraints on serpentinisation environments and element cycling in subduction zones - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (292KB)Download full-size imageFluid-mobile elements in serpentinites: Constraints on serpentinisation environments and element cycling in subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Jiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectJiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectVolcanic rocks with arc affinities have been recognized on both sides of the Jiangnan Orogen.Jiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectA divergent double subduction model is applied to the Jiangnan Orogen.Jiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectSuch a model can explain the absence of continental deep subduction in the Jiangnan Orogen.Jiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectJiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageJiangnan Orogen in South China: Developing from divergent double subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Transition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirectTransition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirect8 OBSs and 14 inland stations were used to analyze the seismic features.Transition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirect9 focal mechanisms were determined based on the first arrivals motion.Transition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirectTwo main borders along east Taiwan were defined based on relocated earthquakes.Transition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirectThe underthrusted arc/fore-arc forms the transition from collision to subduction.Transition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirectThe arc/for-arc deformation occurred mainly in the marine area.Transition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirectTransition of the Taiwan-Ryukyu collision-subduction process as revealed by ocean-bottom seismometer observations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Assessing collapse safety of CBF buildings subjected to crustal and subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectAssessing collapse safety of CBF buildings subjected to crustal and subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectSubduction records suitable for Victoria BC were selected from Mw9 Tohoku earthquake.Assessing collapse safety of CBF buildings subjected to crustal and subduction earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe 12-st.

Tremors in the overriding continental crust of several subduction zones suggest fluid circulation at shallower depths, but potential fluid pathways are still poorly documented. Using receiver function analysis in the Cascadia subduction zone, we provide evidence for a seismic discontinuity near 15 km depth in the crust of the overriding North American plate. This interface is segmented, and its interruptions are spatially correlated with conductive regions of the forearc and shallow swarms of seismicity and non-volcanic tremors. These observations suggest that fluid circulation in the overriding plate is controlled by fault zones separating blocks of accreted terranes. These zones constitute fluid escape routes that may influence the seismic cycle by releasing fluid pressure from the megathrust.Deep crustal fracture zones control fluid escape and the seismic cycle in the Cascadia subduction zone -

For example, the buoyancy of high bathymetric relief is thought to flatten the dip of the subducting slab, modifying the structural and magmatic evolution of the overriding plate and terminating arc volcanism. In addition, the effect of ridge subduction in retreating plate boundaries can inhibit subduction rollback, a process that could locally pin the subduction hinge and lead to the development of cusps and slab tearing. Here we discuss the tectonic response to subduction of high bathymetric relief using examples from the circum-Pacific subduction systems. We demonstrate that flattening of the subduction dip angle is only significant in the eastern Pacific, where the average slab dip angle is relatively shallow. In the western Pacific, in contrast, the average subduction dip angle is steeper and there is no significant flattening of the dip angle in areas of ridge subduction. Subduction of high bathymetric relief in the circum-Pacific is commonly associated with reduced arc volcanism, and in many cases, the area of ridge subduction coincides with a volcanic gap. In the overriding plate, ridge subduction is associated with pronounced changes in the style of deformation, involving uplift, reactivation of basement thrusts, development of orogen-perpendicular tear faults and block rotations leading to oroclinal bending. The discussed characteristic patterns associated with ridge subduction provide important guidelines for reconstructing past plate tectonic processes, and could help constraining the geodynamics of ancient subduction systems.Tectonic and magmatic responses to the subduction of high bathymetric relief - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageTectonic and magmatic responses to the subduction of high bathymetric relief - ScienceDirectTectonic and magmatic responses to the subduction of high bathymetric relief - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectA numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectA thermomechanical/petrological model of subduction zone is presented.A numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectWe constrain dehydration, re-hydration and melting in a warm subduction zone.A numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectWarm slab crust devolatilizes completely at shallow depth.A numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectCrust melting is only achieved if H2O is advected from the deeper part of the slab.A numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectWarm subduction zone leads to extensive mantle wedge melting at shallow depth.A numerical approach to melting in warm subduction zones - ScienceDirectThe complex feedback between dehydration and melting in hot subduction zones is quantitatively addressed in this study. We present an integrated numerical tool that combines a high-resolution thermo-mechanical subduction model with a thermodynamic database that allows modeling metamorphic devolatilization, and subsequent re-hydration and melting reactions. We apply this tool to quantify how the hydration state of a lithologically layered subducting slab varies during interaction with the hot mantle wedge and how this affects any melting taking place in the subducting crust or the overlying mantle wedge. Total crustal dehydration is achieved before any crustal melting can occur, even in very young subducting slabs. Significant oceanic crust melting is only achieved if the metamorphic fluids from the dehydrating underlying subducting slab mantle are fluxed through the dry eclogites. But our models further demonstrate that even if the oceanic crust can melt in these specific conditions, the preceding crustal dehydration will simultaneously result in extensive mantle wedge melting at lower pressures than for colder slabs. The significant mantle wedge melting implies that also for hot subduction zones, most of the melt feeding the overriding plate is of mantle origin.Shear heating induced lithospheric-scale localization: Does it result in subduction? - ScienceDirectShear heating induced lithospheric-scale localization: Does it result in subduction? - ScienceDirectShear heating induced lithospheric-scale localization: Does it result in subduction? - ScienceDirectShear heating induced lithospheric-scale localization: Does it result in subduction? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Absolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectAbsolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectWe compute 130 Myr of subduction kinematics from plate tectonic reconstructions.Absolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectWe examine trench kinematics for a range absolute plate motion models.Absolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectHotspot absolute plate motion models give plausible results back to 70 Ma.Absolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectSlab-remnant models are preferred prior to 70 Ma.Absolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectAbsolute plate motions since 130 Ma constrained by subduction zone kinematics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectIn natural subduction zones, subduction erosion may initially occur through steady erosion at the edge of the continental plate. As material is removed, the subduction angle may gradually decrease, increasing the strength of the plate boundary zone. The increased strength may lead to failure in the continental interior, unsteady removal of a large forearc block and relocation of the subduction zone into the upper plate where the cycle may repeat. The proposed cycle may explain observed patterns in the Andean margin, including steady and unsteady erosion recorded in the geological record and along-strike variation in present-day subduction angles.Subduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Subduction erosion modes: Comparing finite element numerical models with the geological record - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, UK.Evolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectEvolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectAnalogue models of free subduction and resulting mantle flow are performed.Evolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectStereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry technique is used to map the 3-D mantle flow.Evolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectOne type of mantle upwelling occurs outboard due to return flow around each slab edge.Evolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectThree other types of mantle upwelling occur throughout the subduction zone.Evolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectUpwelling near slab edges is present from subduction initiation until late stage.Evolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectEvolution of 3-D subduction-induced mantle flow around lateral slab edges in analogue models of free subduction analysed by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Molybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMo enrichment in the arc lavas is caused by fluids derived from the subducted slab.Molybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMolybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectThe fate of crustal material recycled into the convecting mantle by plate tectonics is important for understanding the chemical and physical evolution of the planet. Marked isotopic variability of Mo at the Earth's surface offers the promise of providing distinctive signatures of such recycled material. However, characterisation of the behaviour of Mo during subduction is needed to assess the potential of Mo isotope ratios as tracers for global geochemical cycles. Here we present Mo isotope data for input and output components of the archetypical Mariana arc: Mariana arc lavas, sediments from ODP Sites 800, 801 and 802 near the Mariana trench and the altered mafic, oceanic crust (AOC), from ODP Site 801, together with samples of the deeper oceanic crust from ODP Site 1256. We also report new high precision Pb isotope data for the Mariana arc lavas and a dataset of Pb isotope ratios from sediments from ODP Sites 800, 801 and 802. The Mariana arc lavas are enriched in Mo compared to elements of similar incompatibility during upper mantle melting, and have distinct, isotopically heavy Mo (high 98Mo/95Mo) relative to the upper mantle, by up to 0.3 parts per thousand. In contrast, the various subducting sediment lithologies dominantly host isotopically light Mo. Coupled Pb and Mo enrichment in the Mariana arc lavas suggests a common source for these elements and we further use Pb isotopes to identify the origin of the isotopically heavy Mo. We infer that an aqueous fluid component with elevated [Mo], [Pb], high 98Mo/95Mo and unradiogenic Pb is derived from the subducting, mafic oceanic crust. Although the top few hundred metres of the subducting, mafic crust have a high 98Mo/95Mo, as a result of seawater alteration, tightly defined Pb isotope arrays of the Mariana arc lavas extrapolate to a fluid component akin to fresh Pacific mid-ocean ridge basalts. This argues against a flux dominantly derived from the highly altered, uppermost mafic crust or indeed from an Indian-like mantle wedge. Thus we infer that the Pb and Mo budgets of the fluid component are dominated by contributions from the deeper, less altered (cooler) portion of the subducting Pacific crust. The high 98Mo/95Mo of this flux is likely caused by isotopic fractionation during dehydration and fluid flow in the slab. As a result, the residual mafic crust becomes isotopically lighter than the upper mantle from which it was derived. Our results suggest that the continental crust produced by arc magmatism should have an isotopically heavy Mo composition compared to the mantle, whilst a contribution of deep recycled oceanic crust to the sources of some ocean island basalts might be evident from an isotopically light Mo signature.Molybdenum mobility and isotopic fractionation during subduction at the Mariana arc -

ScienceDirectResults suggest strong slab-asthenosphere coupling.Pronounced zonation of seismic anisotropy in the Western Hellenic subduction zone and its geodynamic significance - ScienceDirectMany subduction zones exhibit significant retrograde motion of their arc and trench. The observation of fast shear-wave velocities parallel to the trench in such settings has been inferred to represent trench-parallel mantle flow beneath a retreating slab. Here, we investigate this process by measuring seismic anisotropy in the shallow Aegean mantle. We carry out shear-wave splitting analysis on a dense array of seismometers across the Western Hellenic Subduction Zone, and find a pronounced zonation of anisotropy at the scale of the subduction zone. Fast SKS splitting directions subparallel to the trench-retreat direction dominate the region nearest to the trench. Fast splitting directions abruptly transition to trench-parallel above the corner of the mantle wedge, and rotate back to trench-normal over the back-arc. We argue that the trench-normal anisotropy near the trench is explained by entrainment of an asthenospheric layer beneath the shallow-dipping portion of the slab. Toward the volcanic arc this signature is overprinted by trench-parallel anisotropy in the mantle wedge, likely caused by a layer of strained serpentine immediately above the slab. Arcward steepening of the slab and horizontal divergence of mantle flow due to rollback may generate an additional component of sub-slab trench-parallel anisotropy in this region. Poloidal flow above the retreating slab is likely the dominant source of back-arc trench-normal anisotropy. We hypothesize that trench-normal anisotropy associated with significant entrainment of the asthenospheric mantle near the trench may be widespread but only observable at shallow-dipping subduction zones where stations nearest the trench do not overlie the mantle wedge.Pronounced zonation of seismic anisotropy in the Western Hellenic subduction zone and its geodynamic significance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shear-wave splitting at the edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectShear-wave splitting at the edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectShear-wave splitting at the edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Present-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectPresent-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectComparison of 3D viscoelastic FEMs and present-day stress field dataPresent-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectRole of kinematics and subduction geometry in generating the observablesPresent-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectMantle flow direction controls the stress regimes within plates.Present-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectThe trench curvature induces stress axes rotations at crustal depths.Present-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectAlong-strike deformation is predicted at intermediate and deeper depths in slabs.Present-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectPresent-day stress field in subduction zones: Insights from 3D viscoelastic models and data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectRheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectWe study continental subduction and UHP exhumation using advanced numerical models.Rheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectContinental subduction is mainly a transient process requiring strong mantle lithosphere rheologyRheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectDuring convergence, UHP exhumation occurs at subduction phase.Rheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectUHP exhumation is a poly-phase process driven by viscous buoyancy drag.Rheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectUHP exhumation is favored in slow convergence settings.Rheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectRheological and geodynamic controls on the mechanisms of subduction and HP/UHP exhumation of crustal rocks during continental collision: Insights from numerical models - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Constraining sediment subduction: A converted phase study of the Aleutians and Marianas - ScienceDirectConstraining sediment subduction: A converted phase study of the Aleutians and Marianas - ScienceDirectConstraining sediment subduction: A converted phase study of the Aleutians and Marianas - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The evolution of the subduction zone magmatism on the Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic active margins of the Paleoasian Ocean - ScienceDirectThe evolution of the subduction zone magmatism on the Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic active margins of the Paleoasian Ocean - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Carbonation of subduction-zone serpentinite (high-pressure ophicarbonate;

Inferences from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectThe surface expression of a lateral polarity change of continental mantle lithosphere subduction has been studied by using lithosphere-scale physical models. Key parameters investigated were: the degree of lateral coupling between adjacent domains of opposing subduction polarity, the width of the zone separating the domains, and the lithosphere geometry and rheology. The model results illustrate an asymmetric lithospheric structure induced by deformation of the downgoing plates, which have been separated by a narrow transition zone. A wide and symmetric orogenic wedge overlying a region of thickened mantle lithosphere and hampered subduction characterizes this transition zone. In addition, interaction between the neighboring subduction domains caused downbending of the upper plates and resulted in the lateral termination of crustal structures and lowering of surface topography. The lateral extent of interaction between the domains strongly depends on the degree of coupling between the domains, the rheology of the mantle lithosphere and the amount of bulk shortening. The modelling results have major implications on the interpretation of seismic and tomographic data from the European Alps in terms of the crust and lithosphere geometries. It appears that an observed lateral change of subduction polarity at mantle depth can explain the variations of wedge build-up between the Western/Central and Eastern Alps.Does subduction polarity changes below the Alps?

This paper reports detailed field observations, petrographic descriptions, sandstone detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic analyses from an accretionary complex (preserved as Mugagangri Group) and the unconformably overlying Shamuluo Formation near Gaize. The youngest detrital zircon ages, together with other age constraints from literature, suggest that the Mugagangri Group was deposited during late Triassic-early Jurassic, while the Shamuluo Formation was deposited during late Jurassic-early Cretaceous. Based on the differences in lithology, age and provenance, the Mugagangri Group is subdivided into the upper, middle and lower subunits. These units are younging structurally downward/southward, consistent with models of progressive off-scrapping and accretion in a southward-facing subduction complex. The upper subunit, comprising mainly quartz-sandstone and siliceous mud/shale, was deposited in abyssal plain environment close to the Qiangtang passive margin during late Triassic, with sediments derived from the southern Qiangtang block. The middle and lower subunits comprise mainly lithic-quartz-sandstone and mud/shale, containing abundant ultramafic/ophiolitic fragments. The middle subunit, of late Triassic-early Jurassic age, records a transition in tectono-depositional setting from abyssal plain to trench-wedge basin, with sudden influx of sediments sourced from the central Qiangtang metamorphic belt and northern Qiangtang magmatic belt. The appearance of ultramafic/ophiolitic fragments in the middle subunit reflects the subduction initiation. The lower subunit was deposited in a trench-wedge basin during early Jurassic, with influx of Jurassic-aged zircons originating from the newly active southern Qiangtang magmatic arc. The lower subunit records the onset of arc magmatism related to the northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean. The Shamuluo Formation, comprising mainly lithic-feldspar-sandstone with limestone interlayers, was deposited in a post-collisional residual-sea or pre-collisional trench-slope basin, with sediments derived entirely from the Qiangtang block.The subduction-accretion history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean: Constraints from provenance and geochronology of the Mesozoic strata near Gaize, central Tibet - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.On the thermal evolution of the mantle wedge at subduction zones - ScienceDirectOn the thermal evolution of the mantle wedge at subduction zones - ScienceDirectOn the thermal evolution of the mantle wedge at subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectSerpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectAn anomalous density block observed in the fore-arc region.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectThe anomalous density block could be related serpentinization and distributes along the Longitudinal Valley, the suture zone.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectThe degree of serpentinization is approximately 18%.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling - ScienceDirectSerpentinized peridotite in the fore-arc has been observed in a number of subduction zones, including the northern Manila subduction zone which terminates northward in the Taiwan arc-continent collision. How this zone of serpentinization changes northward from the subduction of thinned continental lithosphere to full arc-continent collision in the Taiwan orogeny is not well known. In this paper we present 2-D gravity modeling along three P-wave (Vp) transects across the Taiwan orogeny. Two of these transects were collected with ocean-bottom seismometers. These two transects provide good constraints on the velocity structure to the west of, and on land, southern Taiwan. Conversion of Vp to density in this area allows us to model the gravity anomaly with very little misfit. Along the subduction zone, however, the velocity models are poorly constrained in the upper mantle, where an anomalous density unit has to be used in order to model the short wavelength gravity anomaly in this area. A third transect across central Taiwan that is derived from the TAIGER local tomography data, provides good control on the crust and upper mantle Vp structure that we use to place provide density constraints for modeling the gravity anomaly in this part of the collision zone. In order to model the short wavelength gravity anomaly across the Longitudinal Valley and the southern Longitudinal trough, an anomalous density block is required beneath the fore-arc region. We interpret that the source of this anomalous density material could be serpentinized fore-arc mantle, similar to what is interpreted for the northern Manila subduction zone farther south. Water released from the subduction of the extended crust of the continental margin results in the serpentinization of the fore-arc area and may be driving the uplifting of the high-pressure rocks.Serpentinization of the fore-arc mantle along the Taiwan arc-continent collision of the northern Manila subduction zone inferred from gravity modeling -

ScienceDirectResidual phengite and fluids control the release of thallium to the arc surface.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America - ScienceDirectSediment is actively being subducted in every convergent margin worldwide. Yet, geochemical data for arc lavas from several subduction zones, such as Northern Tonga and Costa Rica have revealed either attenuated or limited evidence for sediment in their mantle source regions. Here we use thallium (Tl) isotopes to trace slab components in lavas from the Tonga-Kermadec and Central American arcs. In general, both arcs display Tl isotope data that are most compatible with addition of sediment to the sub-arc mantle from the subducting slab. This evidence is particular strong in the Tonga-Kermadec arc where pelagic clays dominate the Tl budget along the entire arc. Contributions from altered oceanic crust as well as the Louisville Seamount chain that subducts underneath Northern Tonga are not visible in Tl isotopes, which is likely due to the very high Tl concentrations found in pelagic sediments outboard of the Tonga-Kermadec arc. Lavas from Central America reveal variable and systematic Tl isotope compositions along-strike. In particular, lavas from Nicaragua are dominated by contributions from sediments, whereas Costa Rican samples reveal a significant altered oceanic crust component with little influence from sediments on thallium isotope composition. The absence of a sediment signature in Costa Rica corresponds with the Cocos Ridge and the seamount province subduction, which results in a thinner sediment cover. Furthermore, the subducted sediment is dominated by carbonates with very low Tl concentrations and, therefore, small amounts of carbonate sediment added to the mantle wedge do not contribute significantly to the overall Tl budget.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America - ScienceDirectA review of Tl isotope and concentration data from the Aleutians, Marianas, Tonga-Kermadec and Central American arcs demonstrate that pelagic sediments are detectable in most arcs, whereas altered oceanic crust components only become appreciable when sediment Tl concentrations are very low (e.g. carbonate) or if sediments are no longer a significant component of the subducting slab (e.g. slab melting in Western Aleutians). As such, Tl isotopes are a promising tool to trace sediment subduction although this requires at least some pelagic sediment is present in the subducted sediment package.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America - ScienceDirectWe suggest that thallium partitioning between the slab and mantle wedge is most likely controlled by retention in phengite or by partitioning into fluids. Residual phengite likely produces high Cs/Tl ratios because Tl should be more compatible in phengite than is Cs, however, this conclusion needs experimental verification. The stability of phengite is lower at higher fluid contents, which results in hyperbolic relationships between Cs/Tl and possible indicators of fluids such as Sr/Nd and Ba/Th. Thus, combined Tl isotopic and elemental systematics not only provide detailed information about the specific slab components that contribute to arc lavas, but also potentially shed light on the mineralogy and physical conditions of subducting slabs.Thallium isotopes as tracers of recycled materials in subduction zones: Review and new data for lavas from Tonga-Kermadec and Central America -

ScienceDirectThe kinematics of subduction zones shows a variety of settings that can provide clues for dynamic understandings. Two reference frames are used here to describe the simple 2D kinematics of subduction zones. In the first, the upper plate is assumed fixed, whereas in the second frame upper and lower plates move relative to the mantle.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectCombining the different movements, at least 14 kinematic settings can be distinguished along the subduction zones. Variable settings can coexist even along a single subduction zone, as shown for the 5 different cases occurring along the Apennines subduction zone. Apart from few exceptions, the subduction hinge converges toward the upper plate more frequently along E- or NE-directed subduction zone, whereas it mainly diverges from the upper plate along W-directed subduction zones accompanying backarc extension.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectBackarc spreading forms in two settings: along the W-directed subduction zones it is determined by the hinge divergence relative to the upper plate, minus the volume of the accretionary prism, or, in case of scarce or no accretion, minus the volume of the asthenospheric intrusion at the subduction hinge. Since the volume of the accretionary prism is proportional to the depth of the decollement plane, the backarc rifting is inversely proportional to the depth of the decollement. On the other hand, along E- or NE-directed subduction zones, few backarc basins form (e.g., Aegean, Andaman) and can be explained by the velocity gradient within the hangingwall lithosphere, separated into two plates.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectThis kinematic observation casts serious doubts on the slab negative buoyancy as the primary driving mechanism of subduction and plate motions.Subduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectSubduction kinematics and dynamic constraints - ScienceDirectAll this indicates that subduction zones have different origin as a function of their geographic polarity, and the subduction process is more a passive feature rather than being the driving mechanism of plate motions.

ScienceDirectThe recycling of oceanic lithosphere back into the Earth's interior through subduction is a central component of plate tectonics. The process by which new subduction zones initiate, however, remains poorly understood. Several different mechanisms for subduction initiation have been proposed, including passive margin collapse (aided by sediment loading and/or rheological weakening due to the presence of volatiles) and forced convergence across a zone of preexisting lithospheric weakness. In this paper we focus on the latter type of model, which identifies three conditions necessary for subduction initiation: a zone of weakness such as a fracture zone, an age (and therefore density) offset along the fracture zone, and significant normal compressive stress which leads to shortening. We identify regions on the present-day Earth which meet these conditions and which may correspond to regions of relatively likely subduction initiation in the near future. Using a digital seafloor age model, we have created a database of oceanic fractures and quantified the associated age offsets. We have evaluated the state of stress on these lithospheric weak zones using two different global stress models. We find that the conditions needed to initiate subduction via the forced convergence model are relatively rare on the present-day Earth, and that there is little indication of incipient subduction at regions identified as relatively likely for subduction initiation. Using the same technique, we have evaluated the state of stress and seafloor age offset at regions of inferred present-day incipient subduction, and find that most of these regions are not associated with both high far-field compressive stresses and large age (and thus density) offsets. Subduction has likely initiated via forced convergence across preexisting zones of lithospheric weakness in the past, but our results indicate that the conditions needed for this type of subduction initiation are rare on the present-day Earth.State of stress and age offsets at oceanic fracture zones and implications for the initiation of subduction -

ScienceDirectLate-collision sites are significant for crustal growth; although less efficient than subductions, they are better preserved.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectSites similar to late collision may be a realistic alternative to supra-subduction arcs for Archaean crustal growth.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectEarth's continental crust is dominantly made of buoyant, felsic igneous material (granitoids), that was ultimately extracted from the mantle as a result of Earth's differentiation. Since felsic melts are not in chemical equilibrium with the mantle, they can originate either from melting of older crustal lithologies, or from differentiation of a primitive mantle melt; only the latter case will contribute to crustal growth. To understand the mechanisms of continental crust growth and differentiation through time, it is therefore necessary to unravel the respective contribution of these two different mechanisms in the genesis of granitoid suites. In modern Earth, granitoids are chiefly generated in convergent plate boundaries (subduction and collision). This paper examines the granitic suites in a late-collision environment, the Variscan French Massif Central (FMC), and compares them with the suites found in an oceanic arc. We therefore describe, and compare, two end-members sites of granite generation.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectIn the FMC, several main types of granites are described. Muscovite and Cordierite bearing Peraluminous Granites (resp. MPG and CPG) contain large amounts of inherited zircons, and their chemistry demonstrates that their sources were older crustal material (resp. metasediments and metaigneous). On the other hand, Potassic Calc-alkaline Granites (KCG), associated to potassic diorites (vaugnerites) do not contain inherited zircons, and ultimately derive from the vaugnerites. The vaugnerites in turn form by partial melting of a mantle contaminated by the regional crust. Therefore, although they are isotopically similar to the crust, the KCG are net contributors to crustal growth. Thus we conclude that although late-orogenic settings are dominated by crustal melting and recycling, they may be sites of net crustal growth, even though this is not visible from isotopes only. In contrast, arc granitoids are purely or almost purely mantle derived. However, the preservation potential of arcs is much smaller than the preservation of late-orogenic domains, such that at the scale of a whole orogenic belt, late-orogenic magmatism is probably as important as arc magmatism.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectFinally, we speculate that the situation may have been similar in the Archaean, or even more skewed towards late-orogenic sites (or similar environments, dominated by melting of an altered mafic protocrust), owing to the hotter mantle and less stable subductions during that period.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Collision vs. subduction-related magmatism: Two contrasting ways of granite formation and implications for crustal growth - ScienceDirectRecycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectRecycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectThe Purang peridotites are not the complementary mantle residues of spatially associated oceanic crust.Recycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectThe Purang peridotites may represent ancient subduction-modified SCLM domains.Recycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectThe Purang peridotites have been rejuvenated by late-stage percolating N-MORB melts.Recycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectA deep mantle recycling model is preferred to reconcile the presence of SuR-UHP mineral assemblages.Recycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectRecycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectRecycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectRecycling of ancient subduction-modified mantle domains in the Purang ophiolite (southwestern Tibet) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Invited review paper: Seismicity along the South American subduction zone: Review of large earthquakes, tsunamis, and subduction zone complexity - ScienceDirectInvited review paper: Seismicity along the South American subduction zone: Review of large earthquakes, tsunamis, and subduction zone complexity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of geometry and eclogitization on oceanic plateau subduction - ScienceDirectInfluence of geometry and eclogitization on oceanic plateau subduction - ScienceDirectInfluence of geometry and eclogitization on oceanic plateau subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake swarms in circum-Pacific subduction zones - ScienceDirectEarthquake swarms in circum-Pacific subduction zones - ScienceDirectEarthquake swarms in circum-Pacific subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectSubduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectThe Cuaba subcomplex includes diverse arc-like mafic protoliths.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectIt contains fragments of its supra-subduction zone mantle.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectIt represents part of the subducted fore-arc of the Caribbean island-arc.Subduction of fore-arc crust beneath an intra-oceanic arc: The high-P Cuaba mafic gneisess and amphibolites of the Rio San Juan Complex, Dominican Republic - ScienceDirectThe Rio San Juan metamorphic complex (RSJC) exposes a segment of a high-P accretionary prism, built during Late Cretaceous subduction below the intra-oceanic Caribbean island-arc.

The intrusion also exhibits an adakitic signature (high Sr, low Y and HREE contents) suggesting that Ordovician magmatism also occurred within the Indochina Terrane, associated with an enigmatic, early Gondwana subduction event. This intrusion appears part of a broader, bilateral Early Ordovician magmatism, newly linked to the south-east subduction of the Tamky-Phuoc Son Ocean underneath the Kontum terrane, and a north-west subduction beneath the Truong Son terrane. Significantly, sub-economic hydrothermal Cu mineralisation observed within the dioritic intrusion, hints at the presence of local Ordovician, porphyry-style base metal enrichment.Evidence for Ordovician subduction-related magmatism in the Truong Son terrane, SE Laos: Implications for Gondwana evolution and porphyry Cu exploration potential in SE Asia - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (100KB)Download full-size imageEvidence for Ordovician subduction-related magmatism in the Truong Son terrane, SE Laos: Implications for Gondwana evolution and porphyry Cu exploration potential in SE Asia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectVariation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectWe analyzed aftershock sequences along the Mexican subduction margin.Variation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectThe p and b values were determined.Variation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectVariation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectResults indicate a slight tendency for p values to decrease from west to east.Variation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectThe b values show an opposite, increasing trend towards the east.Variation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectVariation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (118KB)Download full-size imageVariation of b and p values from aftershocks sequences along the Mexican subduction zone and their relation to plate characteristics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Origin of a zone of anomalously high porosity in the subduction inputs to Nankai Trough - ScienceDirectOrigin of a zone of anomalously high porosity in the subduction inputs to Nankai Trough - ScienceDirectAbundant dispersed ash in high porosity zone (HPZ)Origin of a zone of anomalously high porosity in the subduction inputs to Nankai Trough - ScienceDirectAltered volcanic glass forms aggregatesOrigin of a zone of anomalously high porosity in the subduction inputs to Nankai Trough - ScienceDirectCements maintain intra-aggregate porosityOrigin of a zone of anomalously high porosity in the subduction inputs to Nankai Trough - ScienceDirectOrigin of a zone of anomalously high porosity in the subduction inputs to Nankai Trough - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Triassic E-MORB-like basalts associated with porphyry Cu-deposits in the southern Yidun continental arc, eastern Tibet: Evidence of slab-tear during subduction?

They show significant variability in terms of extension and shortening. We investigated numerically the physical controls of these processes using a 2D petrological-thermo-mechanical intra-oceanic subduction model with spontaneous volcanic arc growth and deformation. We varied the fluid- and melt-related weakening, the ages of both the subduction slab and the overriding plate, the subducting plate velocities, and the cohesive strength of rocks. Three main geodynamic regimes were identified: retreating subduction with opening of a backarc basin, stable subduction, and advancing, compressive subduction. The main difference between these regimes is the degree of rheological coupling between plates, which is governed by the intensity of rheological weakening induced by fluids and melts. Retreating subduction regimes require plate decoupling, which results from strong weakening due to both fluids and melts. Spreading centers nucleate either in forearc or in intraarc regions. Episodic trench migration is often due to variations of plate coupling with time, which is caused by (fore) arc deformation. Stable subduction regime with little variation in the trench position forms at an intermediate plate coupling and shows a transient behavior from the retreating to advancing modes. The advancing subduction regime results from strong plate coupling. At the mature stage, this subduction mode is associated with both partial fragmentation and subduction of the previously serpentinized forearc region. Forearc subduction is typically associated with a magmatic pulse, which is caused by dehydration of subducted serpentinized forearc fragments. Our models demonstrate distinct differences in thermal and lithological structure of subduction zones formed in these different geodynamic regimes. Results compare well with variations observed in natural intra-oceanic arcs.Geodynamic regimes of intra-oceanic subduction: Implications for arc extension vs. shortening processes - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageGeodynamic regimes of intra-oceanic subduction: Implications for arc extension vs. shortening processes - ScienceDirectGeodynamic regimes of intra-oceanic subduction: Implications for arc extension vs. shortening processes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The link between subduction-modified lithosphere and the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit, South China: Constraints from high-Mg adakitic rocks - ScienceDirectThe link between subduction-modified lithosphere and the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit, South China: Constraints from high-Mg adakitic rocks - ScienceDirectThe high-Mg adakitic rocks in the Dexing deposits formed in a non-arc setting.The link between subduction-modified lithosphere and the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit, South China: Constraints from high-Mg adakitic rocks - ScienceDirectThey were formed by melting of the Neoproterozoic subduction-modified lithosphere.The link between subduction-modified lithosphere and the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit, South China: Constraints from high-Mg adakitic rocks - ScienceDirectThe subduction-modified lithosphere is crucial for the Dexing porphyry deposit.The link between subduction-modified lithosphere and the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit, South China: Constraints from high-Mg adakitic rocks - ScienceDirectThe link between subduction-modified lithosphere and the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit, South China: Constraints from high-Mg adakitic rocks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Small-scale convection in the subduction zone mantle wedge - ScienceDirectSmall-scale convection in the subduction zone mantle wedge - ScienceDirectSmall-scale convection in the subduction zone mantle wedge - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectExcellent exposures of high-pressure rocks developed in a Variscan continental subduction system outcrop in NW Iberia. The kinematic criteria provided by the high-pressure metamorphic fabrics can be used to infer tectonic flow within the deep sections of this system. The dominant trend of the ductile flow is oblique to that of the orogenic belt, indicating oblique continental subduction. Its azimuth, a few tens of degrees clockwise relative to the orogenic trend, suggests dextral transpression between Gondwana and Laurussia during continental subduction that took place at the Upper Devonian, and provides a consistent kinematic reference for the earliest assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia.The onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageThe onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectThe onset of the assembly of Pangaea in NW Iberia: Constraints on the kinematics of continental subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction of oceanic asthenosphere: A critical appraisal in central Alaska - ScienceDirectSubduction of oceanic asthenosphere: A critical appraisal in central Alaska - ScienceDirectSubduction of oceanic asthenosphere: A critical appraisal in central Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Teleseismic constraints on the geological environment of deep episodic slow earthquakes in subduction zone forearcs: A review - ScienceDirectMore than a decade after the discovery of deep episodic slow slip and tremor, or slow earthquakes, at subduction zones, much research has been carried out to investigate the structural and seismic properties of the environment in which they occur. Slow earthquakes generally occur on the megathrust fault some distance downdip of the great earthquake seismogenic zone in the vicinity of the mantle wedge corner, where three major structural elements are in contact: the subducting oceanic crust, the overriding forearc crust and the continental mantle. In this region, thermo-petrological models predict significant fluid production from the dehydrating oceanic crust and mantle due to prograde metamorphic reactions, and their consumption by hydrating the mantle wedge. These fluids are expected to affect the dynamic stability of the megathrust fault and enable slow slip by increasing pore-fluid pressure and/or reducing friction in fault gouges. Resolving the fine-scale structure of the deep megathrust fault and the in situ distribution of fluids where slow earthquakes occur is challenging, and most advances have been made using teleseismic scattering techniques (e.g., receiver functions). In this paper we review the teleseismic structure of six well-studied subduction zones (three hot, i.e., Cascadia, southwest Japan, central Mexico, and three cool, i.e., Costa Rica, Alaska, and Hikurangi) that exhibit slow earthquake processes and discuss the evidence of structural and geological controls on the slow earthquake behavior. We conclude that changes in the mechanical properties of geological materials downdip of the seismogenic zone play a dominant role in controlling slow earthquake behavior, and that near-lithostatic pore-fluid pressures near the megathrust fault may be a necessary but insufficient condition for their occurrence.Teleseismic constraints on the geological environment of deep episodic slow earthquakes in subduction zone forearcs: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Repeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectRepeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectWe identify an ongoing SSE in the southcentral Alaska subduction zone with GPS data.Repeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectThis SSE occurs at downdip of the main ruptured asperity of the 1964 earthquake.Repeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectRepeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectRepeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectThe SSEs occur in a transitional area between upper seismogenic and lower slip zones.Repeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectRepeated large Slow Slip Events at the southcentral Alaska subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The global range of subduction zone thermal models - ScienceDirectWe model 56 segments of subduction zones using kinematically defined slabs based on updated geometries from Syracuse and Abers (2006) to obtain a comprehensive suite of thermal models for the global subduction system. These two-dimensional thermal models provide insight to the dehydration and melting processes that occur in subduction zones. Despite the wide range of slab geometries, ages, convergence velocities and upper plates the predicted thermal structures share many common features. All models feature partial coupling between the slab and the overriding plate directly downdip of the thrust zone, invoked to replicate the cold nose observed in measurements of heat flow and seismic attenuation. We test four separate assumptions about the causes of the partial coupling: (1) the downdip end of the partial coupling is at a constant depth, (2) it is at constant distance trenchward from the arc, (3) it is defined by a critical surface slab temperature, or (4) it is adjusted such that the hottest part of the mantle wedge beneath the arc is at a constant temperature for all subduction zones. In all of these models, slabs reach temperatures where the top of the oceanic crust and sediments dehydrate before they reach subarc depths, and the overlying mantle wedge is too hot for hydrous minerals to be stable at subarc depths. By contrast, the interior of the oceanic crust and underlying mantle within the downgoing plate remains cold enough for hydrous phases to be stable beyond the arc in all but the hottest subduction zones, allowing water to be carried beyond the arc in the slab.The global range of subduction zone thermal models -

We define the angle between P, B, and T axes of focal mechanisms and three stress axes of tectonic stress field as the consistency parameter, to research the dynamic changes of focal mechanism pattern in earthquake preparation area before the 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake. The result shows that the consistency parameter decreases before the earthquake, and the area of the lower consistent parameter visually coincides with the distribution of aftershocks. This phenomenon is similar to the Load-Unload Response Ratio (LURR) decreases prior to the occurrence of macro-fracture happened in the acoustic emission experiments involving large rock specimens under tri-axial stress.Characteristics of focal mechanisms in Chile subduction - ScienceDirectThis work is supported by Public Utility Research Project (200808053), and Research Foundation of Science and Technology Plan Project in Hebei Province (12276903D).U enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectU enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectU over Th enrichment in Archean boninites at near trench to intraoceanic fore arc regime.U enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectShallow slab derived Influx of U-rich oxidized fluids into boninitic magmas.U enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectU enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectTh/U ratios in boninites holds key for subduction initiation and Archean ocean oxygenation.U enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectU enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (135KB)Download full-size imageU enrichment and Th/U fractionation in Archean boninites: Implications for paleo-ocean oxygenation and U cycling at juvenile subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Deformation and mantle flow beneath the Sangihe subduction zone from seismic anisotropy - ScienceDirectDeformation and mantle flow beneath the Sangihe subduction zone from seismic anisotropy - ScienceDirectDeformation and mantle flow beneath the Sangihe subduction zone from seismic anisotropy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectHeterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectBoth upper and lower oceanic crust has been recognized in the mantle source of Chaihe-arershan basalts.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectThe recycled oceanic components in the mantle of whole eastern China varied widely, both spatially and temporally.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectThe ongoing Pacific slab subduction might trigger the heterogeneity of source components.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectRecycled oceanic components for continental intraplate basalts could maintain more water than components of typical OIBs.Heterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectHeterogeneous source components of intraplate basalts from NE China induced by the ongoing Pacific slab subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic imaging of a megathrust splay fault in the North Chilean subduction zone (Central Andes) - ScienceDirectSeismic imaging of a megathrust splay fault in the North Chilean subduction zone (Central Andes) - ScienceDirectImaging of a predicted megathrust splay fault using pre-stack depth migration.Seismic imaging of a megathrust splay fault in the North Chilean subduction zone (Central Andes) - ScienceDirectHypocenters located by Bloch et al.

Fluids are essential to this activity, yet their behavior is perhaps the most poorly understood aspect of the subduction process. Though many volatile components are subducted, H2O is the most abundant, is preferentially fractionated into the fluid phase, and, among terrestrial volatiles, is by far the most effective solvent. H2O therefore controls the chemical properties of subduction-zone fluids. Rising pressure (P) and temperature (T) along subduction paths yield increased H2O ionization, which enhances dissolved solute concentrations. Under appropriate conditions, silicate solubilities may become so high that there is complete miscibility between hydrous melts and dilute aqueous solutions. Miscible fluids of intermediate composition (e.g., 50% silicate, 50% H2O) are commonly invoked as material-transport agents in subduction zones; however, phase relations pose problems for their existence over significant length scales in the mantle. Nevertheless, this behavior provides a key clue pointing to the importance of polymerization of alkali aluminosilicate components in deep fluids. Aqueous aluminosilicate polymers may enhance solubility of important elements even in H2O-rich fluids. Subduction-zone fluids may be surprisingly dilute, having only two to three times the total dissolved solids (TDS) of seawater. Silica and alkalis are the dominant solutes, with significant Al and Ca and low Mg and Fe, consistent with a role for aqueous aluminosilicate polymers. Trace-element patterns of fluids carrying only dissolved silicate components are similar to those of primitive island-arc basalts, implying that reactive flow of H2O-rich, Cl-poor, alkali-aluminosilicate-bearing fluid is fundamental to element transport in the mantle wedge. Better understanding of the interaction of this fluid with the mantle wedge requires quantitative reaction-flow modeling, but further studies are required to achieve this goal.The chemistry of subduction-zone fluids - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The chemistry of subduction-zone fluids - ScienceDirectCraig Manning is a Professor of Geology and Geochemistry in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of California Los Angeles.

America.Non-steady-state subduction and trench-parallel flow induced by overriding plate structure - ScienceDirectThe direction of plate tectonic motion and the direction of mantle flow, as inferred from observations of seismic anisotropy measurements, show a good global correlation far from subduction zones. However, this correlation is poor near subduction zones, where below the slab seismic anisotropy is aligned parallel to the trench and above the slab has a complex pattern, which has not been fully explained. Here we present time-dependent three-dimensional (3D) fully-dynamic simulations of subduction to study the effect of overriding plate structure on the evolution of slab geometry and induced mantle flow. We find that along-strike variation in thermal thickness of the overriding plate causes increased hydrodynamic suction and shallower slab dip beneath the colder portion of the overriding plate; the variation in slab geometry drives strong trench-parallel flow beneath the slab and a complex flow pattern above the slab. This new mechanism for driving trench-parallel flow provides a good explanation for seismic anisotropy observations from the Middle and South America subduction zones, where both slab dip and overriding plate thermal state are strongly variable and correlated, and thus may be an important mechanism in other subduction zones. The location and strength of trench-parallel flow vary with the time-dependent evolution of the slab, suggesting that the global variability in seismic anisotropy observations in subduction zones is in part due to the non-steady-state behavior of these systems.Non-steady-state subduction and trench-parallel flow induced by overriding plate structure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectEffects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectModels consisted on oceanic and continental plates floating on asthenosphere.Effects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectWe tested deformation velocity and density ratio (oceanic vs continental plate).Effects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectWe examine the factors generating extension during subduction.Effects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectThe density ratio is a key factor to facilitate extension during subduction.Effects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectWe propose an application to the Anatolian system.Effects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectEffects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectEffects of margin-parallel shortening and density contrasts on back-arc extension during subduction: Experimental insights and possible application to Anatolia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Upper Cretaceous to Miocene tectonostratigraphy of the Azuero area (Panama) and the discontinuous accretion and subduction erosion along the Middle American margin - ScienceDirectUpper Cretaceous to Miocene tectonostratigraphy of the Azuero area (Panama) and the discontinuous accretion and subduction erosion along the Middle American margin - ScienceDirectUpper Cretaceous to Miocene tectonostratigraphy of the Azuero area (Panama) and the discontinuous accretion and subduction erosion along the Middle American margin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influences of the Tonga Subduction Zone on seafloor massive sulfide deposits along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge - ScienceDirectThis study investigates the morphology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits from six back-arc hydrothermal vent fields along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) and Valu Fa Ridge (VFR) in the context of endmember vent fluid chemistry and proximity to the Tonga Subduction Zone. To complement deposit geochemistry, vent fluid analyses of Cu, Zn, Ba, Pb and H2,(aq) were completed to supplement existing data and enable thermodynamic calculations of mineral saturation states at in situ conditions. Results document southward increases in the abundance of mantle-incompatible elements in hydrothermal fluids (Ba and Pb) and SMS deposits (Ba, Pb, As, and Sb), which is also expressed in the abundance of barite (BaSO4) and galena (PbS) in SMS deposits. These increases correspond to a decrease in distance between the ELSC/VFR and the Tonga Subduction Zone that correlates with a change in crustal lithology from back-arc basin basalt in the north to mixed andesite, rhyolite, and dacite in the south. Barite influences deposit morphology, contributing to the formation of horizontal flanges and squat terraces. Results are also consistent with a regional-scale lowering of hydrothermal reaction zone temperatures from north to south (except at the southernmost Mariner vent field) that leads to lower-temperature, higher-pH vent fluids relative to mid-ocean ridges of similar spreading rates (Mottl et al., 2011). These fluids are Cu- and Zn-poor and the deposits formed from these fluids are Cu-poor but Zn-rich. In contrast, at the Mariner vent field, higher-temperature and lower pH vent fluids are hypothesized to result from higher reaction zone temperatures and the localized addition of acidic magmatic volatiles (Mottl et al., 2011). The Mariner fluids are Cu- and Zn-rich and vent from SMS deposits that are rich in Cu but poor in Zn with moderate amounts of Pb. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the contrasting metal contents of vent fluids and SMS deposits can be accounted for by vent fluid pH. Wurtzite/sphalerite ((Zn, Fe)S) and galena (PbS) are saturated at higher temperatures in higher-pH, Zn-, Cu-, and Pb-poor ELSC/VFR vent fluids, but are undersaturated at similar temperatures in low-pH, Zn-, Cu-, and Pb-rich vent fluids from the Mariner vent field.Influences of the Tonga Subduction Zone on seafloor massive sulfide deposits along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge - ScienceDirectInfluences of the Tonga Subduction Zone on seafloor massive sulfide deposits along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume- and arc-related (PAR) units grade from plume- to arc-like.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectPlate tectonics may have started as subduction began around Precambrian plume heads.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectLate Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics - ScienceDirectRobert J.

The model deformation is analyzed with a Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) system that allows for comparison of forearc deformation along the oblique limbs of the curved plate boundary and near the axis of curvature. Moreover, PIV allows for separation of the trench-parallel and trench-perpendicular components of strain, regardless of trench orientation. The resulting deformation maps show a remarkable symmetry and indicate drag of the forearc above the interplate coupling area towards the axis of curvature. Trench-perpendicular profiles show that along the oblique limbs of the plate boundary, the forearc is submitted to trench-normal shortening and trench-parallel shearing but not trench-parallel shortening or extension. This contrasts with the situation near the axis of symmetry where the forearc is submitted to trench-parallel and trench-perpendicular normal shortening, but is not sheared. The experimental results confirm that trench-normal thrusts observed in the fore-arc of the Central-Andes can be a mechanical consequence of subduction along a seaward-concave plate boundary if the degree of interplate coupling is large.Trench-parallel shortening in the forearc caused by subduction along a seaward-concave plate boundary: Insights from analogue modelling experiments -

ScienceDirectFrom opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France) - ScienceDirectAdditionally, this large scale dating project demonstrates that the zircons from eclogites do not systematically recrystallise during the high pressure event and consequently their U-Pb systems do not record that metamorphism systematically. These zircons rather preserve the isotopic memory of the magmatic crystallization of their igneous protolith. Another example of an eclogite sample from the French Massif Central illustrates the frequent mistake in the interpretation of the ages of the early hydrothermal alteration of zircons in the oceanic crust versus partial or complete recrystallization during eclogite facies metamorphism.From opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France) - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (135KB)Download full-size imageFrom opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.East Asia mantle tomography: New insight into plate subduction and intraplate volcanism - ScienceDirectEast Asia mantle tomography: New insight into plate subduction and intraplate volcanism - ScienceDirectEast Asia mantle tomography: New insight into plate subduction and intraplate volcanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neogene evolution of lower trench-slope basins and wedge development in the central Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand - ScienceDirectNeogene evolution of lower trench-slope basins and wedge development in the central Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand - ScienceDirectNeogene evolution of lower trench-slope basins and wedge development in the central Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand - ScienceDirectNeogene evolution of lower trench-slope basins and wedge development in the central Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand - ScienceDirectNeogene evolution of lower trench-slope basins and wedge development in the central Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand - ScienceDirectNeogene evolution of lower trench-slope basins and wedge development in the central Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Testing the geologically testable hypothesis on subduction initiation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.New GPS constraints on the kinematics of the Apennines subduction - ScienceDirectNew GPS constraints on the kinematics of the Apennines subduction - ScienceDirectThe absolute ITRF2005 rotation poles and rates of Eurasia, Africa and Adriatic plates are estimated, to study the kinematics along their boundaries in the Apennines belt.New GPS constraints on the kinematics of the Apennines subduction - ScienceDirectNew GPS constraints on the kinematics of the Apennines subduction - ScienceDirectVelocities are estimated both relative to Eurasia, and relative to the deep and shallow hotspot reference frames (HSRF).

Arc volcanism may have been particularly important in the most recent Greenhouse of the late Cretaceous, where it has been hypothesized that the subduction of the carbonate-rich Tethys contributed to overall higher volcanic CO2 outgassing rates and thus a warmer climate. To test this hypothesis, the decarbonation efficiencies of modern subduction zones were calculated through a geochemical database that compared subaerial arc CO2 fluxes with the subducting crust and sediment geochemistry. The modern data are used to postulate a CO2 recycling and degassing scenario for arc volcanism related to the closure of the Tethys. Our analysis indicates that the thermal structure of subduction zones controls the extent and depth of slab decarbonation, while the sediment geochemistry (e.g. the amount of carbonate sediment) may be of secondary importance. The calculated decarbonation efficiency of modern arcs ranges from 18 to 70%. Our calculations support recent models predicting carbon recycling through infiltration-driven decarbonation, and limited by water availability at sub-arc depths. This analysis allows us to make inferences about the potential volcanic CO2 flux from subduction of the Tethys during the Cretaceous, suggesting between an 8 and 222% increase over modern CO2 outgassing. We suggest that the primary reason for the increase in CO2 outgassing in the Cretaceous is contamination of arc magmas by platform carbonates in the overlying crust and increased decarbonation efficiency.Decarbonation efficiency in subduction zones: Implications for warm Cretaceous climates -

ScienceDirectEffects of mixing on water mass subduction are analyzed in the South Pacific Ocean. Model simulations using a passive tracer and its adjoint are employed in conjunction with a particle tracking method to distinguish effects of mixing from those of advection. The results show that mixing processes can contribute to as much as 20% of the overall subduction rate in the South Pacific. Of this mixing contribution, about 30% can be attributed to meso-scale eddies, including their associated bolus transport, while the major part (70%) is due to other diabatic processes. The impact of mixing reaches its maximum near the Sub-Antarctic Front, accounting for nearly 30% of the total subduction rate. Consequently, estimates based on tracing particles or on advection alone may significantly underestimate the subduction rate in the South Pacific Ocean.Effects of mixing on the subduction of South Pacific waters identified by a simulated passive tracer and its adjoint - ScienceDirectEffects of mixing on the subduction of South Pacific waters identified by a simulated passive tracer and its adjoint - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Were they all giants?

ScienceDirectOur dataset shows that undeformed serpentinite still preserves an oceanic geochemical fingerprint, whereas mylonitic serpentinite is reset in its concentrations of FME and its B, Sr and Pb isotope compositions, due to interaction with sediment- and crust-derived fluids. The environment of this interaction is either compatible with (i) an outer-rise zone setting, with percolation of seawater-derived fluids enriched in sedimentary components into bending-related fault structures, or with (ii) subduction channel domains, where ascending sediment-derived slab fluids infiltrate slices of former oceanic serpentinite accreted to the plate interface domain. Influx of sediment-derived subduction fluids along major deformation zones in serpentinite modifies the element budget of the rocks, with important implications for element recycling and the tectonic history of serpentinite. The B, Sr and Pb isotopic systematics, coupled with FME concentration in serpentinites are particularly helpful geochemical tracers of interaction between different reservoirs in subduction-interface environments, and are more sensitive than the traditionally applied stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions.Linking serpentinite geochemistry with tectonic evolution at the subduction plate-interface: The Voltri Massif case study (Ligurian Western Alps, Italy) -

ScienceDirectCrystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) of rocks from an exhumed subduction channel of the Alpine orogen were determined using time-of-flight neutron diffraction. This method allows the investigation of large polymineralic samples and, more importantly, the application of full pattern fit methods to constrain CPOs of mineralogically complex rocks. Samples studied include intensely deformed fresh and retrogressed eclogites, as well as metasediments, which are interleaved with the eclogites in the subduction channel. From the CPO, seismic properties of the samples were calculated. P-wave anisotropies of the eclogite samples are fairly low, with an average of about 1.5%, and mainly constrained by pronounced omphacite CPO. Growth and deformation of retrograde amphibole in the eclogites also led to a pronounced CPO, which has a large impact on seismic anisotropies by raising them to up to 3.7% and changing the orientations of velocity maxima. Elastic anisotropies of the subducted metasediments are higher (up to 7.4%) and constrained by quartz and mica CPO in clastics and by calcite CPO in marble. VP/VS ratios may help to distinguish fresh eclogites from retrogressed ones, and both rock types from mantle peridotites of downgoing lithospheric slabs in seismic imaging. Our data also indicate that subducted terrigenous sediments not only are strongly anisotropic, but also have low VP/VS ratios. This way there may be the potential to image them by seismic tomography at depth in active subduction channels.Crystallographic preferred orientations of exhumed subduction channel rocks from the Eclogite Zone of the Tauern Window (Eastern Alps, Austria), and implications on rock elastic anisotropies at great depths - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evidence for episodic aseismic slip across the subduction seismogenic zone off Costa Rica: CORK borehole pressure observations at the subduction prism toe - ScienceDirectEvidence for episodic aseismic slip across the subduction seismogenic zone off Costa Rica: CORK borehole pressure observations at the subduction prism toe - ScienceDirectEvidence for episodic aseismic slip across the subduction seismogenic zone off Costa Rica: CORK borehole pressure observations at the subduction prism toe - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evidence for episodic aseismic slip across the subduction seismogenic zone off Costa Rica: CORK borehole pressure observations at the subduction prism toe - ScienceDirectNEPTUNE Canada, University of Victoria, P.O.

Eastern China is an ideal natural laboratory to investigate the behavior and evolution of cratonic blocks within a subduction system. In this study, we investigate deformation of the upper mantle beneath eastern China. We present seismic shear wave splitting measurements from three networks consisting of over 483 broadband stations, with 157 stations giving a total of 516 results. The splitting parameters exhibit complex regional patterns but are relatively coherent within individual tectonic units. Tectonic blocks exhibited distinctive fast directions relative to regional features. The dominant attitude of fast directions for the North China Craton was subparallel to the direction of subduction, whereas fast directions for Southeastern China were perpendicular to the direction of subduction. The shear wave splitting measurements were interpreted according to a high resolution tomographic body-wave velocity model. Combining these two datasets showed that the predominant geodynamic models for the region (mantle plume, mantle wedge and flat-slab subduction models) are incompatible with the observations presented here. We suggest that the North China Craton, Yangtze Craton and the Cathaysia block have undergone different deformational events due to differing mantle flow patterns, and distinct spatial and temporal subduction histories of the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates.Distinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageDistinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China - ScienceDirectDistinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Distinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China - ScienceDirectDistinct upper mantle deformation of cratons in response to subduction: Constraints from SKS wave splitting measurements in eastern China - ScienceDirectAssembling North China Craton within the Columbia supercontinent: The role of double-sided subduction - ScienceDirectAssembling North China Craton within the Columbia supercontinent: The role of double-sided subduction - ScienceDirectThe lithologic associations within the Inner Mongolia Suture Zone dividing the Yinshan Block to the north and Ordos Block to the south correspond to an accreted ocean plate stratigraphic sequence, with the tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneisses, charnockites and calc-alkaline granites representing a continental arc built up through subduction from the north. The seismic transects bring out a contrasting polarity in the subduction regime with an oblique east- to southward subduction of the Yinshan Block and a westward subduction of the Yanliao Block. Here I propose a double-sided subduction history for the NCC, similar to the ongoing subduction process in the Western Pacific. Such double-sided subduction is considered to promote rapid amalgamation of continental fragments within supercontinents and the subduction polarities and mantle dynamics of NCC are therefore considered to be critical in evaluating the final assembly of the Paleoproterozoic supercontinent Columbia.Assembling North China Craton within the Columbia supercontinent: The role of double-sided subduction -

ScienceDirectConvergent plate boundaries around the globe show a high degree of structural complexity and variability in site-specific geometry and mass flux. The heterogeneity in the structural evolution, the interior regime as well as external architecture of individual margins is reflected in their seismic character, resulting in a segmentation along-strike as well as along-dip. Subduction zones generate more than 80% of global earthquakes above magnitude 8.0, but rupture characteristics are highly individual and linked to margin specific geometrical conditions. Major segments of subduction zones are commonly submerged in deep water and difficult to access at the majority of margins. Marine geophysical techniques, which are able to image the complex structures in these settings with sufficient coherency and depth penetration, have proven crucial to improve our knowledge on the geological framework of the different types of subduction zones. The aim of this review paper is to unravel the structural diversity of convergent margins and between individual subduction zone segments. Field data from different margins around the globe deliver images of the seafloor and subsurface in unprecedented resolution, which show segmentation to be far more complex than previously inferred. Along-strike segmentation results in accretionary segments contiguous to erosive segments along a single margin. Modes of mass transfer must hence be viewed as transient processes dependent on sediment supply and lower plate structure. Along-strike segment boundaries commonly correlate with underthrusting lower plate relief that controls the deep deformation of a subduction zone and the spatial and temporal variations in slip behavior. Examples of underthrusting oceanic basement relief at different stages of subduction elucidate their impact on the inner geometry of the margin. Lower plate heterogeneities occur at subduction zones worldwide and thus pose a common phenomenon, whose role as barriers to seismic rupture constitute a central control on subduction zone seismicity and segmentation.Invited review paper: The control of subduction zone structural complexity and geometry on margin segmentation and seismicity -

By reviewing seismic and geodetic studies of megathrust locking/creeping state, we find that creeping is the predominant mode of subduction in areas of extremely rugged subducting seafloor such as the Kyushu margin, Manila Trench, northern Hikurangi, and southeastern Costa Rica. In Java and Mariana, megathrust creeping state is not yet constrained by geodetic observations, but the very rugged subducting seafloor and lack of large earthquakes also suggest aseismic creep. Large topographic features on otherwise relatively smooth subducting seafloor such as the Nazca Ridge off Peru, the Investigator Fracture Zone off Sumatra, and the Joban seamount chain in southern Japan Trench also cause creep and often stop the propagation of large ruptures. Similar to all other known giant earthquakes, the Tohoku earthquake of March 2011 occurred in an area of relatively smooth subducting seafloor. The Tohoku event also offers an example of subducting seamounts stopping rupture propagation. Very rugged subducting seafloor not only retards the process of shear localization, but also gives rise to heterogeneous stresses. In this situation, the fault zone creeps because of distributed deformation of fractured rocks, and the creep may take place as transient events of various spatial and temporal scales accompanied with small and medium-size earthquakes. This process cannot be described as stable or unstable friction along a single contact surface. The association of large earthquakes with relatively smooth subducting seafloor and creep with very rugged subducting seafloor calls for further investigation. Seafloor near-trench geodetic monitoring, high-resolution imaging of subduction fault structure, studies of exhumed ancient subduction zones, and laboratory studies of low-temperature creep will greatly improve our understanding of the seismogenic and creep processes and their hazard implications.Invited review paper: Fault creep caused by subduction of rough seafloor relief - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evidence for a subduction component in the diamond-bearing mantle of the Siberian craton - ScienceDirectEvidence for a subduction component in the diamond-bearing mantle of the Siberian craton - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variations of slab dip and overriding plate tectonics during subduction: Insights from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectWe present small-scale laboratory models of oceanic subduction in which plates motion is imposed by lateral boundary conditions. The oceanic plate moves trenchward at constant speed and subducts below a fixed overriding plate. In this configuration, the long-term process of subduction is not steady-state. Slab interaction with the upper mantle-lower mantle boundary results in periods of slab flattening during which the dip of the slab diminishes, followed by periods of slab steepening. The overriding plate tectonic regime is influenced by the dynamics of subduction, slab anchoring favouring trench perpendicular shortening. When the slab is anchored, slab flattening further favours shortening, while slab steepening favours extension or smaller shortening rates. Non-steady-state long-term subduction may explain part of the variability of slab geometries evidenced by statistical analyses of present-day subduction zones. Experiments suggest that, despite boundary conditions applied on the converging plates do not change, tectonics pulses within the overriding plate may be caused by this non-steady-state behaviour.Variations of slab dip and overriding plate tectonics during subduction: Insights from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variations of slab dip and overriding plate tectonics during subduction: Insights from analogue modelling - ScienceDirectSubduction zone metamorphic pathway for deep carbon cycling: II.

We investigate the dynamics and energetics for a free subduction system, driven solely by downgoing plate buoyancy, using a finite-element model of a viscoelastic plate with a free surface, sinking into a passive unbounded mantle represented by drag forces. Parameters are varied to study effects of an asthenosphere, ridge push, and a passive overriding plate, for a range of subducting plate viscosities and densities. Such a single, free plate achieves subduction mainly through trench retreat. Most of the energy dissipation occurs in driving the passive mantle response. As a result, the slab's sinking velocity is its Stokes velocity, determined by lithospheric buoyancy and mantle viscosity. The total subduction velocity and dip adjust to minimize bending dissipation in the lithosphere, and are affected by slab rheology as well as buoyancy. A low viscosity asthenosphere and ridge push facilitate plate advance, increasing plate dips and lowering subduction velocity, while suction and buoyancy of a work-free passive overriding plate decreases plate dips, thus increasing subduction and rollback velocities. However, the geometrical relation between the different parameters is the same in all model cases, because the slabs sink according to their Stokes velocity. The free subduction models thus provide a reference that can be used to distinguish the signature of downgoing plate buoyancy from that of other driving forces in global compilations of subduction parameters.Dynamic models of downgoing plate-buoyancy driven subduction: Subduction motions and energy dissipation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectSubduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction erosion: Rates, mechanisms, and its role in arc magmatism and the evolution of the continental crust and mantle - ScienceDirectCharles Stern is Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.

Here we extend such models to incorporate an overriding plate and present the results of how such an overriding plate feedbacks into the dynamics of free subduction. In this study, we address three fundamental aspects of these dynamics: 1) How does the presence of an overriding plate change the force balance at the convergent margins? 2) How are the forces from deep subduction propagated to the surface? And 3) what controls the stress regime in a system of coupled upper and subducting plates and how is it expressed in the deformations and plate motions? In general, we find that the evolution of subduction zones is strongly controlled by both the interactions between the slab and the upper-lower mantle discontinuity as well as the strength of the upper plate. When either the subducting or upper plates are unable to move, subduction motions are steady state and partitioned entirely into either slab rollback or plate advance, respectively. When conditions favour a quasi-stationary trench, the subducted lithosphere can form into a pile with multiple recumbent folds of slab material atop the lower mantle. Alternating between forwards- and backwards-draping slab, the corresponding horizontal trench motions at the surface are frontward and rearward, respectively, resulting in either a compressive or extensional regime in the back-arc. Time-dependent forcing arising from the slab piling behaviour can have a feedback with upper plate and produce strongly non-steady state, intermittent phases of upper plate deformation as those commonly observed on Earth. Two types of discontinuous back-arc strain evolution are identified: (1) periodic, when recurrent phases of strain over finite durations are accommodated by (viscous) stretching/thickening of the plate, and (2) episodic, when upper plate deformation localizes (plastic strain) and allows for punctuated episodes. These phases can include extension, quiescence, and compression, giving rise to a large variety of possible tectonic evolutions. The models presented here provide insight into the dynamics behind the non-steady-state evolution of subduction, which can help unravel seemingly erratic motions of major convergent margins and back-arc deformations around the Pacific and Indian Oceans during the Cenozoic.Upper plate controls on deep subduction, trench migrations and deformations at convergent margins -

We present a case study of lavas from the Central Island Province (CIP) of the Mariana arc, supplemented by representative sedimentary and altered oceanic crust (AOC) inputs from ODP Leg 129 Hole 801 outboard of the Mariana trench. Given the large Tl concentration contrast between the mantle and subduction inputs coupled with previously published distinctive Tl isotope signatures of sediment and AOC, the Tl isotope system has great potential to distinguish different inputs to arc lavas. Furthermore, CIP lavas have well-established inter island variability, providing excellent context for the examination of Tl as a new stable isotope tracer.Assessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectAssessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectAssessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectMuch work remains to better understand the controls on Tl processing through a subduction zone.

However, data for Tl partitioning in phengite (and other micas) is required before developing this application further. Establishing a database of Tl concentrations and stable isotopes in subduction zone lavas with different thermal parameters and sedimentary inputs is required for the future use of Tl as a subduction zone tracer.Assessing the utility of thallium and thallium isotopes for tracing subduction zone inputs to the Mariana arc - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Uptake of carbon and sulfur during seafloor serpentinization and the effects of subduction metamorphism in Ligurian peridotites - ScienceDirectUptake of carbon and sulfur during seafloor serpentinization and the effects of subduction metamorphism in Ligurian peridotites - ScienceDirectUptake of carbon and sulfur during seafloor serpentinization and the effects of subduction metamorphism in Ligurian peridotites - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageUptake of carbon and sulfur during seafloor serpentinization and the effects of subduction metamorphism in Ligurian peridotites - ScienceDirectUptake of carbon and sulfur during seafloor serpentinization and the effects of subduction metamorphism in Ligurian peridotites - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Uptake of carbon and sulfur during seafloor serpentinization and the effects of subduction metamorphism in Ligurian peridotites - ScienceDirectNow at Virginia Tech Geosciences, 4044 Derring Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, USA.Andean growth and the deceleration of South American subduction: Time evolution of a coupled orogen-subduction system - ScienceDirectAndean growth and the deceleration of South American subduction: Time evolution of a coupled orogen-subduction system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Autocorrelation analysis of ambient noise in northeastern Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectAutocorrelation analysis of ambient noise in northeastern Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectAutocorrelation analysis of ambient noise in northeastern Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tears or thinning?

The eclogite-facies garnet metaperidotite and chlorite harzburgite bodies embedded in paragneiss of the subduction melange from Cima di Gagnone derive from serpentinized peridotite protoliths and are unique examples of ultramafic rocks that experienced subduction metasomatism and devolatilization.

Combining major element mapping and laser-ablation ICP-MS bulk inclusion analysis, we characterize the mineral content of polyphase inclusions and quantify the fluid composition.

They are located in the prolongation of those mapped on the Atlantic seafloor entering subduction, such as the Barracuda Ridge. This MCS grid also provides evidences on unexpected huge along-strike topographical variation of the backstop basement and of the deformation style affecting the outer forearc crust and sediments. Their mapping clearly indicates two principal areas of active deformation in the prolongation of the major Barracuda and Tiburon ridges and also other forearc basement highs that correspond to the prolongation of smaller oceanic basement highs recently mapped on the Atlantic seafloor.

Specific type of source, propagation path and site geologic condition may perhaps simultaneously be responsible for such anomalous behaviour. The empirical attenuation relations developed by Atkinson and Boore [3] using a global database for subduction zone earthquakes have been therefore suitably modified to be more appropriate for the northeast India. The modified relationships are developed by combining the data for both horizontal and vertical components of motion. The response spectra of the accelerograms recorded in northeast India from earthquakes with widely varying magnitude and distance are, in general, found to match very well with the predictions from the modified attenuation model. The proposed model can thus be used to obtain more realistic estimate of the contribution of in-slab subduction zone earthquakes to seismic hazard in the northeast Indian region.Response spectral attenuation relations for in-slab earthquakes in Indo-Burmese subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recycling of water, carbon, and sulfur during subduction of serpentinites: A stable isotope study of Cerro del Almirez, Spain - ScienceDirectRecycling of water, carbon, and sulfur during subduction of serpentinites: A stable isotope study of Cerro del Almirez, Spain - ScienceDirectRecycling of water, carbon, and sulfur during subduction of serpentinites: A stable isotope study of Cerro del Almirez, Spain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Aseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectAseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectA large number of Korean and Japanese seismic data are analyzed jointly.Aseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectAseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectA slab window exists in the aseismic Philippine Sea slab.Aseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectHot upwelling exists below the Philippine Sea slab and above the Pacific slab.Aseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectAseismic deep subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and slab window - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mobility of elements in a continental subduction zone: evidence from the UHP metamorphic complex of the Kokchetav massif - ScienceDirectMobility of elements in a continental subduction zone: evidence from the UHP metamorphic complex of the Kokchetav massif - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A community benchmark for subduction zone modeling - ScienceDirectWe have developed a suite of benchmarks to facilitate the comparison of numerical models for the dynamics and thermal structure of subduction zones. The benchmark cases are based on a thermomechanical approach in which the slab is prescribed kinematically and the wedge flow is computed dynamically. We propose various cases to investigate the influence of boundary conditions and rheology on wedge flow and resulting thermal structure. A comparison between the codes suggest that accurate modeling of the thermal field requires a good implementation of the velocity discontinuity along the seismogenic zone and high resolution in the thermal boundary layers. A minor modification to the boundary conditions of the wedge flow is also necessary to avoid a pressure singularity that exists in analytical solutions of the cornerflow model.A community benchmark for subduction zone modeling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A-type granite belts of two chemical subgroups in central eastern China: Indication of ridge subduction - ScienceDirectA-type granite belts of two chemical subgroups in central eastern China: Indication of ridge subduction - ScienceDirectA-type granite belts of two chemical subgroups in central eastern China: Indication of ridge subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A morphologic proxy for debris flow erosion with application to the earthquake deformation cycle, Cascadia Subduction Zone, USA - ScienceDirectA morphologic proxy for debris flow erosion with application to the earthquake deformation cycle, Cascadia Subduction Zone, USA - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismotectonics in the Pamir: An oblique transpressional shear and south-directed deep-subduction model - ScienceDirectEarthquake-triggered deposits in the subduction trench of the north Ecuador/south Colombia margin and their implication for paleoseismology - ScienceDirectEarthquake-triggered deposits in the subduction trench of the north Ecuador/south Colombia margin and their implication for paleoseismology - ScienceDirectEarthquake-triggered deposits in the subduction trench of the north Ecuador/south Colombia margin and their implication for paleoseismology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Crustal stabilization through the processes of ridge subduction: Examples from the Chugach metamorphic complex, southern Alaska - ScienceDirectCrustal stabilization through the processes of ridge subduction: Examples from the Chugach metamorphic complex, southern Alaska - ScienceDirectCrustal stabilization through the processes of ridge subduction: Examples from the Chugach metamorphic complex, southern Alaska - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectLate Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectLate Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectGeochemistry revealed that the NJO was a ridge subduction type ophiolite.Late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectRidge subduction model may account for the diverse associated rocks in NJO.Late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectOur study shed new light on the Precambrian tectonic evolution of the South China.Late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectLate Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectLate Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectLate Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic ridge subduction along southern margin of the Jiangnan Orogen: New evidence from the Northeastern Jiangxi Ophiolite (NJO), South China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The most continent-sided occurrence of the Phanerozoic subduction-related orogens in SW Japan: Zircon U-Pb dating of the Mizoguchi gneiss on the western foothill of Mt.

In this article, recent studies on the subduction of the Philippine Sea and Pacific plates beneath the Japanese Islands and the mechanism of earthquake and magma generation associated with plate subduction are reviewed. Seismic tomographic studies have shown that the Philippine Sea plate subducting beneath southwest Japan is continuous throughout the entire region, from Kanto to Kyushu, without disruption or splitting even beneath the Izu Peninsula as suggested in the past. The contact of the Philippine Sea plate with the Pacific plate subducting below has been found to cause anomalously deep interplate and intraslab earthquake activity in Kanto. Detailed waveform inversion studies have revealed that the asperity model is applicable to interplate earthquakes. Analyses of dense seismic and GPS network data have confirmed the existence of episodic slow slip accompanied in many instances by low-frequency tremors/earthquakes on the plate interface, which are inferred to play an important role in stress loading at asperities. High-resolution studies of the spatial variation of intraslab seismicity and the seismic velocity structure of the slab crust strongly support the dehydration embrittlement hypothesis for the generation of intraslab earthquakes. Seismic tomography studies have shown that water released by dehydration of the slab and secondary convection in the mantle wedge, mechanically induced by slab subduction, are responsible for magma generation in the Japanese islands. Water of slab origin is also inferred to be responsible for large anelastic local deformation of the arc crust leading to inland crustal earthquakes that return the arc crust to a state of spatially uniform deformation.Plate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Plate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectPlate subduction, and generation of earthquakes and magmas in Japan as inferred from seismic observations: An overview - ScienceDirectJunichi Nakajima earned a BSc (1998), MSc (2000) and PhD (2003) in Geophysics at Tohoku University, Japan.

ScienceDirectGeological and geophysical data show that the forearc of subduction zones experiences strong deformation during the subduction of aseismic oceanic ridges. In order to better understand ridge-related forearc deformation patterns, we performed a series of three-dimensional finite-element models, in which we varied the ridge shape, the friction coefficient of the plate interface and the mechanical strength of the forearc. Experiments were carried out for migrating/non-migrating ridges and accretive/erosive margins, respectively. Our results show that the subducting ridge uplifts the forearc and induces horizontal displacements that alter the strain regime of both erosive and accretive forearcs. Generally, shortening prevails in front of the ridge, while domains of shortening and extension exist above the ridge. Models with stationary ridges show high uplift rates only above the ridge tip, whereas the forearc above migrating ridges experiences uplift above the leading ridge flank and subsequent subsidence above the trailing flank. The height and width of the ridge as well as the friction coefficient of the plate interface have the largest effect on the forearc deformation patterns, whereas the mechanical strength of the forearc plays a lesser role. Forearc indentation at the trench is largest for high and broad ridges, high friction coefficients and/or weak forearc material. Shortening and extension of the forearc above the ridge are more intense for high and narrow ridges. Our model results provide information about the distribution of ridge-induced displacements and strain fields and hence help to identify deformation patterns caused by subducting aseismic ridges in nature.Three-dimensional finite-element models on the deformation of forearcs caused by aseismic ridge subduction: The role of ridge shape, friction coefficient of the plate interface and mechanical properties of the forearc - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Inhibition of subduction thrust earthquakes by low-temperature plastic flow in serpentine - ScienceDirectInhibition of subduction thrust earthquakes by low-temperature plastic flow in serpentine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Elemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectSubduction zone metamorphism (SZM) and behaviors of chemical elements in response to this process are important for both arc magmatism and mantle compositional heterogeneity. In this paper, we report the results of our petrographic and geochemical studies on blueschist and eclogite facies rocks of sedimentary and basaltic protoliths from two metamorphic sub-belts with different metamorphic histories in the North Qilian Mountain, Northwest China. The protolith of low-grade blueschists is basaltic in composition and is most likely produced in a back-arc setting, while the protoliths of high-grade blueschists/eclogites geochemically resemble the present-day normal and enriched mid-oceanic ridge basalts plus some volcanic arc rocks. The meta-sedimentary rocks, including meta-graywacke, meta-pelite, meta-chert and marble, show geochemical similarity to global oceanic (subducted) sediments. Assuming that high field strength elements (HFSEs) are relatively immobile, the correlated variations of rare earth elements (REEs) and Th with HFSEs suggest that all these elements are probably also immobile, whereas Pb and Sr are mobile in rocks of both basaltic and sedimentary protoliths during SZM. Ba, Cs and Rb are immobile in rocks of sedimentary protoliths and mobile in rocks of basaltic protolith. The apparent mobility of U in rocks of basaltic protolith may be inherited from seafloor alterations rather than caused by SZM.Elemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectOn the basis of in situ mineral compositional analysis (both major and trace elements), the most significant trace element storage minerals in these subduction-zone metamorphic rocks are: lawsonite, pumpellyite, apatite, garnet and epidote group minerals for REEs, white micas (both phengite and paragonite) for large ion lithophile elements, rutile and titanite for HFSEs. The presence and stability of these minerals exert the primary controls on the geochemical behaviors of most of these elements during SZM. The immobility of REEs, Th and U owing to their redistribution into newly formed minerals suggests that subduction-zone dehydration metamorphism will not contribute to the enrichment of these elements in arc magmatism. These observations require the formation and contribution of supercritical fluids or hydrous melts (these can effectively transport the aforementioned incompatible elements) from greater depths to arc magmatism. In addition, the overall sub-chondritic Nb/Ta ratio retained in rutile-bearing eclogites indicates that the subducting/subducted residual ocean crust passing through SZM cannot be responsible for the missing Nb (relative to Ta) in the bulk silicate earth.Elemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectElemental responses to subduction-zone metamorphism: Constraints from the North Qilian Mountain, NW China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectVolatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectVolatile fluxes from volcanoes at subduction zones are reviewed.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectPersistent degassing is the major emission source of most of volatiles.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectDiffuse emission of H2O, CO2 and Cl by springs and soil gases are also important.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectLower crust foundering controls the volatile budget of the subduction zone crust.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan - ScienceDirectGlobal volatile fluxes from subaerial volcanoes at subduction zones were estimated based on a compilation of fluxes from various sources, including persistent degassing, hot and cold springs, soil degassing, and eruptions. Because worldwide comprehensive datasets are not available, especially for diffuse volatile discharges, volatile fluxes from Japan arcs were estimated based on detailed datasets, and the regional fluxes were extrapolated to the global flux with consideration of the regional characteristics of volcanic volatile compositions, which were estimated based on volcanic gas compositions of persistent degassing. The estimated global fluxes indicate that persistent degassing is the major source of volatiles, especially for S with a contribution of 80%. Diffuse discharges and persistent degassing are similarly important sources of H2O, CO2, and Cl, but the contribution of explosive eruptions is less than 15% for all the volatiles. The estimates of diffuse degassing fluxes include large errors due to limited data. However, the potential impact of these sources on the global flux indicates the importance of further studies to quantify these fluxes. The volatile budget of subduction zone volcanism was evaluated by comparing the estimated volatile fluxes, the volatile contents in the crust, and the primitive magma volatile contents. The contribution of volatiles remaining in the crust are not significant; however, consideration of lower crust foundering significantly alters the volatile budget estimate because the primitive magma supply rate should be significantly increased to account for the lower crust foundering.Volatile flux from subduction zone volcanoes: Insights from a detailed evaluation of the fluxes from volcanoes in Japan -

ScienceDirectFormation of South American flat slabs represents a multi-scale and multi-physics process.Simulation of late Cenozoic South American flat-slab subduction using geodynamic models with data assimilation - ScienceDirectThe formation mechanisms of flat slabs in South America remain unclear. To quantitatively evaluate the earlier proposed mechanisms, we simulate the post-100 Ma subduction history below South America using 4-D geodynamic models by progressively incorporating plate kinematics, seafloor ages and key tectonic features including the buoyant oceanic crust, continental cratons, oceanic plateaus (i.e. the inferred Inca plateau, subducting Nazca Ridge and Juan Fernandez Ridge), as well as deformable trench profiles according to recent geological reconstructions. We find that, in the absence of an overriding plate and subducting buoyancy features, the seafloor age affects slab dip angle by controlling the slab's mechanical strength (i.e., the resistance to bending) and negative buoyancy (integrated positive density anomaly that enhances bending). Our models show that slab strength dominates its buoyancy at age >30 Ma and the opposite for younger ages. The existence of a thick overriding plate reduces the slab dip by increasing dynamic suction, and individual cratonic roots further lead to along-trench variations of dip angle reduction. While dynamic suction from the overriding plate generates a permanent reduction of the long-wavelength slab dip angle, it is the final addition of subducting oceanic plateau and aseismic ridges that produces the transient and localized flat-slabs as observed. These results suggest that all mechanisms except the buoyancy features affect the slab dip only at large spatial scales. Our best-fit model with all the above tectonic features included provides a good match to both the upper mantle Benioff zones and the temporal evolution of volcanic arcs since the mid-Miocene. The imperfect match of the Peruvian flat-slab is likely associated with the uncertain 3-D configuration of the Amazonian craton.Simulation of late Cenozoic South American flat-slab subduction using geodynamic models with data assimilation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectExhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectUnderstanding what controls this short-lived exhumation and the detachment and migration of oceanic crustal slices along the subduction channel will provide useful insights into the interplate mechanical coupling in subduction zones.Exhumation of oceanic blueschists and eclogites in subduction zones: Timing and mechanisms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Using garnet to constrain the duration and rate of water-releasing metamorphic reactions during subduction: An example from Sifnos, Greece - ScienceDirectUsing garnet to constrain the duration and rate of water-releasing metamorphic reactions during subduction: An example from Sifnos, Greece - ScienceDirectUsing garnet to constrain the duration and rate of water-releasing metamorphic reactions during subduction: An example from Sifnos, Greece - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectWe apply a finite difference numerical thermal model to the shallow region of the Hikurangi subduction margin, North Island, New Zealand. This subduction zone is characterised by subduction of thick and buoyant crust of the Hikurangi Plateau and along-strike variations in subduction obliquity, onshore surface heat flow (low in the south, high in the north), inferred pore-fluid pressure and seismic style (locked in the south, aseismic in the north).On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThe model reproduces low onshore surface heat flow observed in the southern Hikurangi margin. We propose that greater surface heat flow in the north is caused by shear heating and convective heat flow by fluids escaping from the interface. The model predicts that the Hikurangi megathrust is comparatively cold, so that if the lower limit of the interface seismogenic zone is thermally controlled, it should occur near the intersection with the hangingwall Moho. This agrees with observation in the southern, locked segment, but thermal control alone cannot explain the shallow interseismic locking depth in the central and northern margin.On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectIn crustal strength curves, changing fluid pressure is capable of moving the brittle-viscous transition vertically by tens of kilometres. We propose that subduction zone seismic style depends on the fluid pressure regime both in the hangingwall and along the interface, and define four end-member types of megathrust fault segments. Contrary to many previous studies, we suggest that the high fluid pressure, low shear strength, end-member is fully coupled, with potential for large interplate earthquakes. In the hydrostatic case the fault is stronger, but the brittle-viscous transition occurs significantly shallower than in the near-lithostatic case, inferred to promote aseismic creep at relatively shallow levels. Along-strike variation in seismic style on the Hikurangi megathrust can therefore be explained by variation in fluid pressure state along the margin.On factors controlling the depth of interseismic coupling on the Hikurangi subduction interface, New Zealand - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.H2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectH2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectPartial melting of continental crust influences early collision dynamics.H2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectH2O-present partial melting is the most sensible reaction.H2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectCrustal partial melting and slab detachment both limit continental subduction.H2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectMelting at peak conditions may have occurred in most of UHP domains.H2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectH2O-fluid-saturated melting of subducted continental crust facilitates exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks in continental subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic versus aseismic slip: Probing mechanical properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectSeismic versus aseismic slip: Probing mechanical properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectInvestigating 15-month postseismic deformation following the Tohoku earthquake.Seismic versus aseismic slip: Probing mechanical properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectTime-dependent frictional afterslip model of the Tohoku earthquake.Seismic versus aseismic slip: Probing mechanical properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectRate state friction model to constrain heterogeneous fault frictional properties.Seismic versus aseismic slip: Probing mechanical properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectSeismic versus aseismic slip: Probing mechanical properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Submarine landslides at subduction margins: Insights from physical models - ScienceDirectSubmarine landslides, which commonly develop along subduction margins at the front of accretionary prisms, have recently been recognized as one of the most serious geohazards. To investigate the mechanical processes involved in the development of these landslides, a series of sandbox experiments were performed, and the results were analyzed using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Numerous slope failures, which may be analogous to natural submarine landslides, were produced on the model surface. The slope failures can be classified as follows: Type I failures, which are relatively small but are frequently developed on the lower parts of the slope; and Type II failures, which are relatively large and cover the entire slope, but occur less frequently. Detailed observations reveal that the failure process can be divided into four stages: 1) pre-failure, 2) steepening of the lower slope, 3) Type I failure, and 4) Type II failure. The minor Type I slides act as precursors of major Type II failures. Each slope failure produces a topographic undulation, triggering events in adjacent areas and a lateral migration of discrete slope failures. Although such experiments provide useful insight into slope failure processes, a detailed 3D analysis of the failed sediment is vital if we are to understand the precise history of thrust activity at subduction margins. Recent and Miocene accretionary prisms along the Nankai Trough, Japan, display the geometric and lithologic characteristics of Type I and Type II failures in their slide deposits.Submarine landslides at subduction margins: Insights from physical models - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Submarine landslides at subduction margins: Insights from physical models - ScienceDirectPresent address: IFREE, JAMSTEC, Kanazawa, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan.Petrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectPetrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectPetrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectPetrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectPetrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectVolcanic arc-related hydrous magma emplaced in the lower crust.Petrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectPetrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imagePetrochemistry and mineral chemistry of Late Permian hornblendite and hornblende gabbro from the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Indication of Palaeo-Tethyan subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Subduction zone evolution and low viscosity wedges and channels - ScienceDirectSubduction zone evolution and low viscosity wedges and channels - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Metamorphic chemical geodynamics of subduction zones - ScienceDirectMetamorphic chemical geodynamics of subduction zones - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Metamorphic chemical geodynamics of subduction zones - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageMetamorphic chemical geodynamics of subduction zones - ScienceDirectGray Bebout is a Professor of Geology in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University.

We applied a 3D Kirchhoff prestack depth migration scheme to data sets containing different narrow frequency ranges in order to extract additional details from seismic reflection images. This approach accounts for the effects of scattering on the seismic image, especially for structures below a heterogeneous overburden. The reflection image in such environments will differ significantly when focusing on different frequency ranges due to the frequency dependence of scattering that is likely to be present. The narrow frequency range images uncover reflectors in one frequency range that are masked in another range. Furthermore, the images enable for instance the characterization of the medium in terms of scatterer concentration and thus improve the structural interpretation. The analysis of these images might help to distinguish between small-scale structures in the high-frequency band and large-scale structures in the low-frequency band. We call this imaging approach Reflection Image Spectroscopy (RIS). We applied the RIS approach to the ANCORP'96 data set, an onshore deep seismic reflection profile across the South American Central Andes. The narrow frequency range images revealed additional details that we interpret as features directly linked to fluid migration processes in the subduction zone. Furthermore, structural details of the oceanic crust and the overlying mantle and crust are revealed. From the narrow-frequency range images we interpret that the top of the so called Nazca reflector at 70 km depth marks the upper limit of the hydrated mantle wedge, whereas the bottom of the reflector represents the top of the subducted oceanic crust. The compilation of our results with local earthquake data confirms this interpretation. Similar features observed in another deep seismic profile (PRECORP'95) support this interpretation, too. Furthermore, the RIS images show a highly reflective heterogeneous zone between the Nazca reflector at 70 km depth and a prominent mid-crustal Bright Spot (Quebrada Blanca Bright Spot) at about 30 km depth. We associate this zone with a complex network of ascending fluids or partial melts, initiated by ascending fluids released from the subducted oceanic plate. This observation links the Quebrada Bright Spot directly to the dehydrating oceanic plate.Reflection Image Spectroscopy across the Andean subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Generation of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectGeneration of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectP-type convergent margins supply crust material to the mantle transition zone (MTZ).Generation of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectHydrated and carbonated rocks of oceanic slabs supply H2O and CO2 to the mantle.Generation of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectGeneration of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectH2O and CO2 can metasomatize the mantle and generate hydrous-carbonated plumes (HCPs).Generation of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectHCPs are manifested on the surface as rift basins and intra-plate volcanic fields.Generation of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectGeneration of hydrous-carbonated plumes in the mantle transition zone linked to tectonic erosion and subduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source of the Xinkailing high magnesium andesites, Western Liaoning: Implications for the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and the destruction mechanism of the North China Craton - ScienceDirectHydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source of the Xinkailing high magnesium andesites, Western Liaoning: Implications for the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and the destruction mechanism of the North China Craton - ScienceDirectIncorporation of crustal melts with mafic melts for Xinkailing HMAs.Hydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source of the Xinkailing high magnesium andesites, Western Liaoning: Implications for the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and the destruction mechanism of the North China Craton - ScienceDirectHydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source for mafic melts of Xinkailing HMAs.Hydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source of the Xinkailing high magnesium andesites, Western Liaoning: Implications for the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and the destruction mechanism of the North China Craton - ScienceDirectPhanerozoic successive subductions probably led to destruction of North China Craton.Hydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source of the Xinkailing high magnesium andesites, Western Liaoning: Implications for the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and the destruction mechanism of the North China Craton - ScienceDirectHydrous orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source of the Xinkailing high magnesium andesites, Western Liaoning: Implications for the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and the destruction mechanism of the North China Craton - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of the overriding plate thermal state on the slab dip in an ocean-continent subduction system - ScienceDirectThe effects of the overriding plate thermal state on the slab dip in an ocean-continent subduction system - ScienceDirectThe effects of the overriding plate thermal state on the slab dip in an ocean-continent subduction system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The golden transformation of the Cretaceous plate subduction in the west Pacific - ScienceDirectThe golden transformation of the Cretaceous plate subduction in the west Pacific - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tethyan vs. Cordilleran ophiolites: a reappraisal of distinctive tectono-magmatic features of supra-subduction complexes in relation to the subduction mode - ScienceDirectTethyan vs. Cordilleran ophiolites: a reappraisal of distinctive tectono-magmatic features of supra-subduction complexes in relation to the subduction mode - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.
