These include plentiful water in the form of streams, lakes, snowpack, and glaciers; high-quality sources of obsidian, chert, quartzite and other knappable stone; and a vertically oriented landscape that maximizes floral and faunal diversity within comparatively condensed space.TITLE The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectTITLE The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectEvidence for the familiarity of Clovis groups with the Rocky Mountain landscapes comes principally from three Clovis caches: Anzick, Fenn, and Mahaffy. All three caches are located in the Rockies, collectively contain artifacts made from ten of the highest-quality stone raw materials available in the Southern, Central and Northern Rockies, and at least one of the caches accompanies the burial of a young child who appears to have been interred intentionally on a prominent and likely sacred landform in a mountain valley.TITLE The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectBringing the paper's argument full circle, that same child's genetic profile shows a direct link to that of another youngster buried thousands of years earlier at the Late Glacial Maximum Mal'ta site in the mountainous Trans-Baikal region of Siberia.TITLE The role of the Rocky Mountains in the peopling of North America - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Truck safety evaluation on Wyoming mountain passes - ScienceDirectThe Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for Streets and Highways recommends hill signs be placed in advance of downgrade descent of mountain passes. Mountain passes increase the risk of a runaway, or out of control trucks and so the advance warning signs inform the driver to take special precautions such as reducing speed or using lower gears during the descent. The Wyoming Department of Transportation has installed steep grade advance warning systems on Wyoming mountain passes. However, concerns for out of control trucks on the mountain passes persist. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety effectiveness of steep grade advance warning signs for trucks on Wyoming mountain passes. The safety evaluation was carried out by implementing a zero-inflated negative binomial modeling technique for predicting truck crashes on mountain passes. The outcome was two models that showed the risk of runaway truck accidents were high at locations where either the grades were steep and long or the grades were long with multiple vertical curves. The analysis showed the current advance warning systems were not significantly impacting truck crash risks at the high risk locations. The study, therefore, recommends some improvements to the current advanced warning signs or implementing an improved Federal Highway Administration Grade Severity Rating System based warning system that will significantly improve truck safety at the hazardous locations. The study informs policy makers on the safety issues on Wyoming Mountain passes with regards to runaway trucks and makes recommendations for reducing the risk of runaway truck crashes on mountain passes.TITLE Truck safety evaluation on Wyoming mountain passes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Hydrogeochemical characteristics of mine water in the Harz Mountains, Germany - ScienceDirectWater samples (springs, creeks, mine adits) from different former mining districts of the Harz Mountains and the nearby Kupferschiefer (copper shale) basin of Sangerhausen were analysed for major ions and trace metals. Due to more intensive water rock interactions including the ore minerals, the mine water concentrations of main components and trace metals are generally higher compared to non mining affected surface waters of the mountain range. Furthermore, the content of major ions in mine water is enriched by mixing processes with saline waters from Permian layers in the Kupferschiefer district and at the deeper levels of the mines in the Upper Harz Mountains. The waters of the different mining districts can be distinguished by trace metal occurrences and concentrations derived from the different ore bodies. Water from the Kupferschiefer mines shows the highest Na, Cl, Cu, Mo and U concentrations, whereas a combination of elevated As and Se concentrations is typical for most of the samples from the mines around St. Andreasberg. However, there are exceptions, and some water samples of all the investigated mining districts do not follow these general trends. Despite the influence of mining activities and ore mineralisation, hydrochemical effects due to rain water dilution can be seen in most of the waters. According to the elevation of the mountain range, higher precipitation rates decrease the ion concentrations in the waters of springs, creeks and mine adits.TITLE Hydrogeochemical characteristics of mine water in the Harz Mountains, Germany -

A refined understanding of gold microtextures, the interface between gold and associated minerals, and the role that nanoparticles play in gold mineralization could provide insight into the details of gold growth and may contain indicators of gold ore concentration mechanisms. Furthermore, a refined understanding of the interface also may explain variation in cyanide leaching extraction efficiency and may enable enhancement of recovery methods. Macrocrystalline gold samples from Round Mountain, Nevada were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study suggests that gold nanoparticles are common in Round Mountain gold and associated mineral phases, and may play an important role in the formation of macrocrystalline gold in this deposit. Microtopographic evidence indicates that the two dimensional nucleation and growth mechanism is dominant and nanotextural evidence suggests that nanoparticulate gold was the first stage of growth in the formation of these macrocrystalline samples that grew rapidly at high degrees of supersaturation. Results suggest that the interface between gold and quartz and other related minerals is far more complex than previously thought, and that textures present at the interface and in the bulk gold can help explain mineralization history and can also have implications for gold recovery efficiency for macrocrystalline bearing ore.TITLE A study by electron microscopy of gold and associated minerals from Round Mountain, Nevada - ScienceDirectGold nanoparticles are common in Round Mountain gold and associated mineral phases.

Cantabrian Mountains (Northern Spain) - ScienceDirectGround temperatures determine significant geomorphological processes in a wet and temperate mountain with a narrow high elevation range belt. Twenty five temperature data loggers were buried at a shallow depth in different locations and altitudes and at specifically cold locations at two massifs in the Cantabrian Mountains (North Spain), Picos de Europa and Fuentes Carrionas. This paper analyses the ground thermal regime and associated parameters (e.g. freeze index, duration and depth of freeze, freeze and thaw cycles) and correlates them with active geomorphological processes and landforms. The thermal regime varies in accordance to the topoclimatic conditions, and it was possible to determinate annual phases in function of snow cover behaviour. Main active processes and landforms stop their activity with a large snow cover which thermally protects the ground and in consequence, avoids the freeze and thaw cycles. During this period, the records allow to asseverate the evidence of seasonal freeze grounds in several locations. Permafrost was not discover on the ground at any of the thermometers except one located at the vicinity of a relict ice patch. With the help of geomorphological maps and previous works, we got to establish the relation between geomorphological processes, landforms, snow cover and ground thermal regime.TITLE Ground temperatures, landforms and processes in an Atlantic mountain.

In this article, we offer an overview of the affective experiences ensuant with mountain biking over a range of common ride obstacles and terrain. By adopting a post-modern subcultural approach, our analysis reveals the link between rider affect and different components on mountain bike tracks. In doing so, our paper brings together the voices of dedicated and experienced mountain bike riders in New Zealand.TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectThe research follows a qualitative phenomenological methodology to explore trail components and affective experiences. Through the use of semi-structured interviews, datum has been gathered from 12 reputable mountain biker riders. As a highly experienced rider, the lead researcher's reflexivity is entwined in the research process and acts as a point of reference for many of the findings. This research increases knowledge in regard to ride experience, and the key components that help define the sport of mountain biking. The findings highlight how the strongest ride affects are brought about by the accumulation of experiences on various obstacles found on entire tracks. However, the affects can also be examined individually with examples such as jumps, drops, or fast sections. We also found that the obstacles on tracks that caused the greatest affect were those that were awkward, difficult, technical, fast, or overwhelmingly induced states of flow.TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectResearch defining trail components and obstacles offers resource managers important qualitative information for designing, building and maintaining new mountain bike parks:TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectProvides insight into how mountain bikers choose their ride locations and mountain bike parks.TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectProvides a qualitative overview for track designers and builders in regard to what trail formations are most desired by dedicated mountain bikers.TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectBike parks, trail networks, and individual trail managers may use these insights for the benefit of trail planning and site selection when considering terrain, gradient, elevation, drainage and overall rider satisfaction.TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Affective ride experiences on mountain bike terrain - ScienceDirectScarlett Hagen has been broadly involved in cycling for the past 15 years.

Global spatial statistics of paterae and mountains and their associated lineations reveal that both types of features are more common at low latitudes and tectonic lineations have preferred orientations, whereas straight patera margins are randomly oriented. Additionally, structurally controlled lineations tend to cluster with each other, and in areas of high concentrations these tectonic lineations are shorter in length than their global average. These results indicate that global-scale (rather than local or regional) processes are involved in forming Io's tectonic structures, but that the diversity of mountain characteristics and the collapse of paterae adjacent to mountain complexes are more locally controlled. Regional structural mapping of the Hi'iaka, Shamshu, Tohil, and Zal regions reveals Io's mountains reside in large, fault-bounded crustal blocks that have undergone modification through local responses of subsurface structures to variable stresses. Strike-slip motion along reactivated faults led to the formation of transpressional and transtensional features, creating tall peaks and low basins, some of which are now occupied by paterae. We propose Io's mountains result from a combination of crustal stresses involving global and local-scale processes, dominantly volcanic loading and tidal flexing. These stresses sometimes are oriented at oblique angles to pre-existing faults, reactivating them as reverse, normal, or strike-slip faults, modifying the large, cohesive crustal blocks that many of Io's mountains reside in. Further degradation of mountains and burial of faults has occurred from extensive volcanism, mass wasting, gravitational collapse, and erosion by sublimation and sapping of sulfur-rich layers. This model of fault-bounded blocks being modified by global stresses and local structural response accounts for the variation and patterns of mountain sizes, shapes, and orientations, along with their isolation and interactions with other features. It also provides a context for the operation and extent of global and regional stresses in shaping Io's surface.TITLE Lineations and structural mapping of Io's paterae and mountains: Implications for internal stresses - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Lineations and structural mapping of Io's paterae and mountains: Implications for internal stresses - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Geosciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794TITLE Surface surveying in high mountain areas, is it possible?

Mountains, in particular, are reckoned to be particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon; therefore, several policy measures attempt to maintain agricultural activities in mountains. In addition to the role of targeted subsidies in reducing abandonment of mountainous areas, we contend that place attachment helps explain the permanence of economic activity in these areas. By using survey data and controlling for several variables likely to influence place attachment, we investigated the relationship between place attachment and living in high or lower altitude mountains in a sample of livestock farmers in the French Southern Alps. Applying an ordered probit model, we found high-mountain farmers to be relatively more attached to their place compared to medium-mountain ones. Our findings also suggest that social relations at the family and neighborhood levels, satisfaction at work, and the distinctiveness farmers assign to a place are important factors of attachment. However, we found no significant association between place attachment and farm profitability. Several policy implications regarding agricultural abandonment and support for mountain livelihoods are derived.TITLE Place attachment as a factor of mountain farming permanence: A survey in the French Southern Alps - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectTITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectSocial capital is used to explore rancher perspectives on sociocultural change resulting from tourism and amenity migration.TITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectMountain resort tourism and amenity migration present opportunities and challenges to rancher socialization.TITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectThis has not necessarily diminished rancher social capital.TITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectConflict can instigate social capital development and contribute to positive outcomes.TITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration - ScienceDirectIn response to rural restructuring, many communities throughout the Rocky Mountain West have shifted from extractive and land-intensive industries to service-based economies, contributing to significant socio-cultural change for local residents, including ranchers. This exploratory study uses social capital as a heuristic device to examine ranchers' perspectives on the way in which mountain resort tourism and amenity migration have affected their patterns of socialization in the ranchlands surrounding Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Findings indicate the importance of both formal and informal bonding and bridging networks within the ranching community. While the introduction of amenity migrants and their differing perceptions on land ownership and management appear to have affected opportunities for informal rancher social interaction, both amongst one another and with their new neighbors, they seem to have encouraged ranchers to band together to protect their livelihoods through informal collective efforts and the formal creation of bridging networks. This indicates that conflict can instigate social capital development and contribute to positive outcomes, such as empowerment and grassroots democracy. Mountain resort tourism and amenity migration therefore appear to present both opportunities and challenges that are altering the nature of rancher social interactions, but not necessarily diminishing their social capital.TITLE Sociocultural change facing ranchers in the Rocky Mountain West as a result of mountain resort tourism and amenity migration -

ScienceDirectMountain streams with their tributary torrents build the upper part of the fluvial network. They are important regarding the transfer of sediment from headwaters to lower basins. Channels are typically steep with wide grain size distributions, ranging from fine sand up to large boulders, and a stabilized bed surface. Mountain streams often are supply-limited with respect to mobile bed load, which needs to be addressed when bed load transport equations are applied to such streams. To better understand supply limitation, laboratory experiments highlighting the effect of bed load supply on incipient motion and bed load transport rate are discussed. Experimental tests were done in which fine bed load was supplied to a previously armored channel bed, with flow conditions ranging from one-third to twice the critical discharge for the bed surface. At flows not exceeding the critical discharge, the time series of the bed load transport rate at the downstream model boundary featured consistent patterns which are attributed to distinct phases: (i) a temporal lag, (ii) an equilibrium state, and (iii) a post-supply phase. Bed load transport occurred even at flows distinctly below that for incipient motion of the bed surface. But, with the mass of total bed load outflow approaching the supply amount, the mass did not exclusively consist of supplied grains. The coarser the supplied bed load, the more sediment was mobilized from the bed surface. At higher flows, processes differed. Total bed load outflow exceeded the supply amount and the break-up of the armor layer caused a refining of the bed surface.TITLE Effect of bed load supply on sediment transport in mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction in mountains - ScienceDirectSince the late 1960s it became clear that a more sustainable protection of people and property from the negative impacts of natural hazards will require a more balanced use of structural and non-structural measures, such as land-use planning and ecosystem-based solutions for disaster risk reduction, also called Eco-DRR. The most prominent example of Eco-DRR in mountainous regions are forests that protect people, settlements and infrastructures against gravitational natural hazards such as avalanches, landslides and hazards related to mountain torrents. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview on the influence of forests on risks induced by natural hazards and the associated challenges and uncertainties concerning risk analysis. Approaches from natural hazard risk are presented, along with recent results from forest research, thereby offering new ways to integrate forests into risk analysis. We discuss the potential effects of forests on the three important hazard components of the risk concept, namely the onset probability, the propagation probability and the intensity, and propose a set of guiding principles for integrating forests into quantitative risk assessment (QRA) for natural hazards. Our focus thereby lies on snow avalanches, rockfalls, floods, landslides, and debris flows. This review shows that existing methods and models for assessing forest effects on natural hazards suffice for integrating forests into QRA. However, they are mostly limited to the stand- or slope-scale, and further efforts are therefore needed to upscale these approaches to a regional level, and account for uncertainties related to forest effects and natural dynamics. Such a dynamic, rather than a static assessment of risk will finally allow for planning and implementing intelligent combinations of Eco-DRR and technical protection measures.TITLE Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction in mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Is reproductive strategy of Alpine mountain hares adapted to different elevations? - ScienceDirectIn Lepus, litter size is inversely related to the duration of the reproductive season resulting in a consistent yearly production of around ten leverets per female. In high latitudes, animals have few litters with large litter sizes, whereas in low latitudes, several litters with small litter sizes are common per year. Knowledge on reproductive performance of Alpine mountain hares (Lepus timidus varronis) is scarce. In this study, we analysed 89 hares from Grisons, Switzerland, by examining placental scars and eye lens weight. The general aim of the survey was to examine the reproductive performance of female Alpine mountain hares. In particular, we focused on the question whether this subspecies adjusts the reproductive strategy in relation to elevation such as other Lepus species do in relation to latitude. All adults of our sample reproduced. 39% of the females littered twice and 61% three times a year with a median litter size of 3.00. We identified a significant effect of elevation on litter size, whereas the elevation did not influence the number of litters. We found no significant difference of yearly reproductive output across elevation range. Hence, some reproductive parameters seem to indicate that the Alpine mountain hare changes the reproductive strategy in relation to elevation similar to the mountain hares living further north do in relation to latitude.TITLE Is reproductive strategy of Alpine mountain hares adapted to different elevations? -

We also discuss the relevance of our model by carrying out comparisons with existing simplified models and with post-seismic field observations on earth dams.

ScienceDirectWe used the process-based model of pasture-woodland vegetation dynamics WoodPaM and newly implemented a forest disturbance routine. We simulated disturbance and grazing scenarios in an artificial mountain landscape and analyzed mosaic patterns with landscape metrics.TITLE Disturbance-grazer-vegetation interactions maintain habitat diversity in mountain pasture-woodlands - ScienceDirectWe found that grazing in absence of disturbance promoted simply structured mosaics that were preconditioned by topography. Only large-scale forest disturbance disrupted this pattern and maintained the historical heterogeneous distribution of grassland communities across all habitat conditions (especially species-rich mountain grasslands on poor soil). This prerequisite is stronger in pasture-woodlands where the ecology of the dominant tree species promotes forest-grassland segregation (F. sylvatica in our case) and less in naturally thin-canopy mountain forest close to the tree line (P. abies). In wilderness areas, the very low density of grazers may limit the maintenance of open habitats regardless disturbance.TITLE Disturbance-grazer-vegetation interactions maintain habitat diversity in mountain pasture-woodlands -

ScienceDirectRocky Mountain spotted fever, a tick-borne zoonosis caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, is among the most lethal of all infectious diseases in the Americas. In Mexico, the disease was first described during the early 1940s by scientists who carefully documented specific environmental determinants responsible for devastating outbreaks in several communities in the states of Sinaloa, Sonora, Durango, and Coahuila. These investigators also described the pivotal roles of domesticated dogs and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (brown dog ticks) as drivers of epidemic levels of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. After several decades of quiescence, the disease re-emerged in Sonora and Baja California during the early 21st century, driven by the same environmental circumstances that perpetuated outbreaks in Mexico during the 1940s. This Review explores the history of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Mexico, current epidemiology, and the multiple clinical, economic, and social challenges that must be considered in the control and prevention of this life-threatening illness.TITLE Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Mexico: past, present, and future - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectIsotope signatures reveal stable oligotrophic conditions.TITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectCarbon cycle dominated by allochthonous POM.TITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking climate change in oligotrophic mountain lakes: Recent hydrology and productivity synergies in Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberian Peninsula) - ScienceDirectThe stability of hydrology and productivity patterns is consistent with Holocene and last millennium reconstructions of past limnological changes in Sanabria Lake.

A research model was proposed in which three hypotheses were developed. Data were collected from a survey of hikers participating in mountain tourism in Malaysia. A total of 396 questionnaires were returned and analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The pull-factors that influence the hikers' to hike certain mountains are the effectiveness of the organising company, trail accessibility, perceived safety risks and the landscape of the mountain. The mountain landscape is the most important factor influencing hikers' assessment to hike certain mountains, followed by the role of the organising company.

As a consequence, many still existing glacier and permafrost landscapes probably transform within decades into new landscapes of bare bedrock, loose debris, sparse vegetation, numerous new lakes and steep slopes with slowly degrading permafrost. These new landscapes are likely to persist for centuries if not millennia to come.TITLE Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectDuring variable but mostly extended future time periods, such new landscapes will be characterized by pronounced disequilibria within their geo- and ecosystems. This especially involves long-term stability reduction of steep/icy mountain slopes as a slow and delayed reaction to stress redistribution following de-buttressing by vanishing glaciers and to changes in mechanical strength and hydraulic permeability caused by permafrost degradation. Thereby, the probability of far-reaching flood waves from large mass movements into lakes systematically increases with the formation of many new lakes and systems of lakes in close neighborhood to, or even directly at the foot of, so-affected slopes. Results of recent studies in the Swiss Alps are reviewed and complemented with examples from the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the Mount Everest region in Nepal.TITLE Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectHot spots of future hazards from potential flood waves caused by large rock falls into new lakes can already now be recognized. To this end, integrated spatial information on glacier/permafrost evolution and lake formation can be used together with scenario-based models for rapid mass movements, impact waves and flood propagation. The resulting information must then be combined with exposure and vulnerability considerations related to settlements and infrastructure. This enables timely planning of risk reduction options. Such risk reduction options consist of two components: Mitigation of hazards, which in the present context are due to effects from climate change, and reduction in consequences, which result from societal conditions and changes. Hazard mitigation may include artificial lake drainage or lake-level lowering and flood retention, optimally in connection with multipurpose structures for hydropower production and/or irrigation. Reduction in damage potential (exposure, vulnerability) can be accomplished by installing early-warning systems, adapting spatial planning and/or by improving preparedness of local people and institutions.TITLE Increasing risks related to landslides from degrading permafrost into new lakes in de-glaciating mountain ranges - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectThe Republic of Armenia is one of the regions least resourced with soils. Currently there is almost no land in Armenia through the development of which it is possible to provide the population with food products, and the industry with the raw material. The only way to solve this problem is to increase soil fertility. The agriculture based on the achievements of contemporary science and technology also creates serious problems.TITLE Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectThis work is devoted to the study of the problems of changes in structural-aggregate composition of brown mountain-forest soils of the Republic of Armenia in relation to their agricultural use. The studies show that the structural elements of virgin brown mountain-forest soils are sufficiently stable and structured. It is shown that with the intensive use of agricultural lands, in comparison with the virgin soils, the most significant changes are observed precisely in the arable horizon (in particular, the arable layer significantly pollinated).TITLE Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectA set of agro-technical measures is offered to improve the structural-aggregate composition, to maintain and enhance the fertility of brown mountain-forest soils. In particular, the improvement of fertility, the efficient use and conservation of brown mountain-forest soils require the development and application of scientifically based system of agro-technical measures. If possible, the minimum or zero agronomic forms of agricultural tillage must be applied in the system of adaptive-landscape agriculture for the restoration and conservation of agronomically valuable soil structure.TITLE Changes of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Journal Annals of Agrarian Science.TITLE Effect of Floodplain Roughness on Velocity Distribution in Mountain Rivers - ScienceDirectThis paper aims to investigate the velocity characteristics of compound rivers in mountain areas, featured with substantially different roughness between the main channel and floodplain. A series of flume experiments have been conducted to investigate the velocity distribution affected by different roughness in the main channel and its floodplain. The experimental data are analysed to obtain a new empirical formula to determine the velocity ratio between the main channel and the floodplain. In addition to the roughness, the ratio between the water depth in the main channel and the floodplain also affects the flow velocity. Therefore the velocity characteristics vary with the roughness and depth in the subsections of the compound channel. The new empirical formula is applied to estimate velocity in the upper reach of Yangtze River, in Chongqing, China. The calculated results are found to be consistent with the field measurements, demonstrating the potential of the formula for estimating velocity distribution in mountain rivers.TITLE Effect of Floodplain Roughness on Velocity Distribution in Mountain Rivers - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of HIC 2016.TITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectTITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectThe influence of air mass origins on aerosol optical properties was analyzed.TITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectTITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectThe effects of regional recirculations and Saharan dust on PM may overlap.TITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectThe SAE mean value was lower than those found at other European mountain sites.TITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectSAE values were influenced by coarse marine and mineral aerosols.TITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectTITLE Influence of air mass origins on optical properties and PM concentrations measured at a high mountain station located in the southwestern Mediterranean - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectTITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectFuel moisture was strongly associated with canopy cover but not time since fire.TITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectFuels were wetter in forests recently burnt by high severity fire.TITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectFuels were drier in forests recently burnt by low severity fire.TITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectWildfire did not have a long-term impact on fuel moisture.TITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectTITLE Fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests with contrasting fire histories - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectTITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectThe spectra of vertical velocity and pressure are dominated by wave bisecting the angle between surface and local windsTITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectThe spectra of horizontal velocity and potential temperature are infinite for waves normal to the local wind.TITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectThe wavefield of horizontal velocity and potential temperature turn with height faster than vertical velocity and pressure.TITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectSpectral analysis reveals a misalignment of wave momentum flux with surface wind, especially at small Richardson numbers.TITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectLinear wave solutions in the spectral space are analyzed to help understand the structure of mountain waves. Nonrotating and hydrostatic waves generated in wind with directional shear past a circular bell-shaped mountain are studied. The power spectra of perturbed vertical velocity and pressure are symmetrically distributed about the orientation of dominant wave component, which bisects the angle between surface wind and local wind directions. The maximum power spectrum increases with the horizontal wind speed but decreases with the wind turning angle. The power spectra of potential temperature and horizontal velocity exhibit an asymmetric distribution except at the surface, which are infinite for the wave components normal to the mean wind. These large-amplitude perturbations of potential temperature and horizontal velocity are advected downstream and the waves finally break, giving rise to the occurrence of turbulent wakes at various heights. All the wavefields rotate with height in the same direction of the mean wind. However, the perturbed vertical velocity and pressure turn at a rate slower than that of horizontal velocity and potential temperature. The application of spectral analysis to the wave momentum flux is discussed, which helps explain the misalignment of wave momentum flux with the surface wind.TITLE Another look on the structure of mountain waves: A spectral perspective - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Detection of spatio-temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation based on long-term meteorological station observations over Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia - ScienceDirectTITLE Detection of spatio-temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation based on long-term meteorological station observations over Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia - ScienceDirectTemporal and spatial trends of air temperature and precipitation in different sub-regions and elevations of Tianshan Mountains were analysed.TITLE Detection of spatio-temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation based on long-term meteorological station observations over Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia - ScienceDirectMutations and significant periodicity of air temperature and precipitation were examined.TITLE Detection of spatio-temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation based on long-term meteorological station observations over Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia - ScienceDirectLarge large scale atmospheric circulation and elevation dependence of trends in air temperature and precipitation were analysed.TITLE Detection of spatio-temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation based on long-term meteorological station observations over Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia - ScienceDirectTITLE Detection of spatio-temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation based on long-term meteorological station observations over Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Black carbon deposition and storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Black carbon deposition and storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Black carbon deposition and storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectBC deposition fluxes at low altitudes were stronger influenced by human activities.TITLE Black carbon deposition and storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectAbout 5% of carbon storage in peatland could be regarded as stable BC carbon.TITLE Black carbon deposition and storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Black carbon deposition and storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountain, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The role of earthquakes and climate in the formation of diamictic sediments in a New Zealand mountain lake - ScienceDirectTITLE The role of earthquakes and climate in the formation of diamictic sediments in a New Zealand mountain lake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectTITLE Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectA new phlebovirus was isolated from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan.TITLE Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectThe virus, designated Kabuto Mountain virus (KAMV), was genetically characterized.TITLE Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectKAMV is phylogenetically related to the Uukuniemi and Kaisodi group viruses.TITLE Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan - ScienceDirectIn Japan, indigenous tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs) and their associated diseases first became evident in 2013 by reported human cases of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). In this study, we report a novel member of the genus Phlebovirus designated as Kabuto Mountain virus (KAMV), which was isolated from the ixodid tick Haemaphysalis flava in Hyogo, Japan. A complete viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed that KAMV is a novel member of TBPVs, which is closely related to the Uukuniemi and Kaisodi group viruses. However, unlike the Uukuniemi group viruses, the 165-nt intergenic region (IGR) in the KAMV S segment was highly C-rich in the genomic sense and not predicted to form a secondary structure, which are rather similar to those of the Kaisodi group viruses and most mosquito/sandfly-borne phleboviruses. Furthermore, the NSs protein of KAMV was highly divergent from those of other TBPVs. These results provided further insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships of TBPVs. KAMV could infect and replicate in some rodent and primate cell lines. We evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of KAMV in suckling mice, where we obtained a virulent strain after two passages via intracerebral inoculation. This is the first report showing the existence of a previously unrecognized TBPV in Japan, other than the SFTS virus.TITLE Isolation and characterization of Kabuto Mountain virus, a new tick-borne phlebovirus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan -

ScienceDirectTITLE Palynology of surface sediments from caves in the Zagros Mountains (Kurdish Iraq): Patterns and processes - ScienceDirectCave palynology has been widely used to reconstruct past vegetation in areas where other conventional sources of pollen are scarce. However, the mechanisms involved in pollen transport, deposition and accumulation in caves are still poorly understood, mostly because of the number of interplaying factors that affect these processes. In this paper we explore some of these factors further by assessing differences in pollen assemblages in transects of surface samples from six caves in the Zagros Mountains of Kurdish Iraq. Simple sac-like caves show a clear pattern in pollen distribution with anemophilous taxa declining from the highest percentages near the front of the cave to lower percentages at the rear of the cave and entomophilous taxa showing the opposite trend. There is a tendency for this pattern to be most marked in caves which are narrow in relation to their length. It is less clear at Shanidar Cave, most probably because of the geometry of the cave but also because of the disturbance and mixing of the superficial sediments caused by the large numbers of people visiting the cave. Only one of the sampled caves shows a different pattern, which is likely to reflect its geomorphological complexity and, consequently, its air circulation. Other factors, such as the presence of a cave entrance flora, are considered but here they seem to have little influence on the pollen assemblages, contrary to that found in temperate-zone caves.TITLE Palynology of surface sediments from caves in the Zagros Mountains (Kurdish Iraq): Patterns and processes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Growth response of Abies georgei to climate increases with elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTITLE Growth response of Abies georgei to climate increases with elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTree growth response of high-elevation Yunnan fir was analyzed to the changing climate.TITLE Growth response of Abies georgei to climate increases with elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China - ScienceDirectJuly temperatures are the most important radial growth determining factors for Yunnan fir.TITLE Growth response of Abies georgei to climate increases with elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTree radial growth of Yunnan fir revealed an elevational trend.TITLE Growth response of Abies georgei to climate increases with elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China - ScienceDirectHigh-elevation Yunnan fir benefits from elevated growing season temperatures under humid summer conditions.TITLE Growth response of Abies georgei to climate increases with elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTITLE Surface dynamic of a protalus lobe in the temperate high mountain.

Mechanized restoration treatments can improve forest health and reduce the likelihood of severe wildfire. These treatments produce some timber, and substantial amounts of forest residues that can be used to generate renewable energy and displace fossil fuels. Using the choice modeling method, this study investigates social preferences for generation of energy with woody biomass produced by restoration treatments on public forests in the Mountain West. Both multinomial logit and latent class logit (LCL) models are fit to the data and used to estimate marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for increased amounts of woody biomass energy generation and important associated co-benefits and costs. Positive and statistically significant MWTP is found for the number of homes powered with wood, the extent of healthy forests, avoiding increases in the number of large wildfires, and local air quality. Significant heterogeneity was found in respondent preferences for the attributes. The heterogeneity can be explained in part by sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents. The LCL revealed four classes of respondents with distinct preferences, revealing conflicting viewpoints toward forest management for woody biomass energy generation.TITLE Heterogeneity in Preferences for Woody Biomass Energy in the US Mountain West -

ScienceDirectCombining structural and functional indicators helps understanding pollution effects.TITLE Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectMountain streams play a key role in the conservation of aquatic biodiversity and key ecosystem services; however human activities are threatening these ecosystems as mountain areas become more and more developed and intensively used. Many of these streams are not considered in current national monitoring programs due to their small catchment area. However, assessing their status and monitoring their trends is well needed to ensure their proper management and conservation. In this study, we evaluated the use of a range of indicators related to different ecosystem structural and functional components in 2 streams affected by sewage outflows and compared with an unpolluted stream in the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain). We surveyed benthic periphyton, macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and also estimated periphyton growth rates, wood decomposition rates and river metabolism. Additionally, we compared the performance of the selected indicators in different hydraulic conditions. Results revealed an effect of the organic pollution on most of the functional and structural indicators for the most polluted stream. Only the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party index, the invertebrate multimetric index used by the regional water agency, the fish abundance and biomass were sensitive enough to detect low levels of pollution and followed the expected response to the pollution degree. Moreover, most of the indicators behaved similarly under different hydraulic conditions, without major differences between pools and runs. However, the combination of both pool and run replicates at the reach scale resulted in a higher detection capacity of the effects of organic pollution.TITLE Analysis of structural and functional indicators for assessing the health state of mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectExtension was ductile and brittle, utilizing bedding and thrust surfaces.TITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectPost-Eocene extension affected the Batinah Coast and eastern Frontal Range faults.TITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (118KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Postobductional extension along and within the Frontal Range of the Eastern Oman Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectUVAFME can be used to simulate forest dynamics in the southern Rocky Mountains.TITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectForest ecotones may shift upslope under climate warming.TITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectModels like UVAFME can be used to help understand the future of valuable ecosystems.TITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Validation and application of a forest gap model to the southern Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Change in Oxygen Saturation Does Not Predict Acute Mountain Sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectTITLE Change in Oxygen Saturation Does Not Predict Acute Mountain Sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectTITLE Change in Oxygen Saturation Does Not Predict Acute Mountain Sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectTITLE Change in Oxygen Saturation Does Not Predict Acute Mountain Sickness on Jade Mountain - ScienceDirectSubjects with AMS had a lower Spo2 than those without AMS; however, the differences between the 2 groups were not clinically significant.

However, in many cases the existing roads require regular de-icing operations which may have a severe impact on the natural hydrogeochemical conditions of the local hydrological systems due to the regular use of substances such as sodium chloride and calcium chloride. The Serra da Estrela Mountain is a strategic area for the water resources management in Portugal because of its geological, geomorphological and climatic framework. This study was carried out in the highest part of the mountain, where road de-icing is frequent during winter. The hydrogeochemical characteristics of several springs, located downstream from roads between 1500 m a.s.l. and 1990 m a.s.l., present clear anthropic signatures which disturbs the quality of the local water resources.TITLE Impact of Road De-icing on the Hydrogeochemistry of Groundwater from a Mountain Area (Serra da Estrela, Central Portugal) - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of WRI-15.TITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectTITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectThere were coastal mountains along the East Asian margin during the Late Cretaceous.TITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectWe applied clumped isotope paleothermometry to paleosol carbonates in Jiaolai Basin.TITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectWe quantitatively estimate the paleoelevation of the coastal mountains.TITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectTITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectTITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectTITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectTITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectPresent address: School of Energy Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing 100083, China.TITLE High elevation of Jiaolai Basin during the Late Cretaceous: Implication for the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin - ScienceDirectPresent address: China Huadian Green Energy Co., Ltd., Beijing 100160, China.TITLE Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectTITLE Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectHolocene glacier activity throughout the Coast Mountains is synthesized.TITLE Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectActivity is synchronous with the global record and regional climate change.TITLE Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectThe Aleutian Low appears to play an important role in long term glacier activity.TITLE Holocene glacier activity in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada - ScienceDirectThe Coast Mountains flank the Pacific Ocean in western British Columbia, Canada.

Whereas mountaineering activities may contribute to the well established beneficial effects of regular exercise, for certain individuals these activities are also associated with a relatively high risk of death.TITLE Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectThis manuscript presents an updated overview of risk and protective factors for sudden cardiac death during leisure activities in the mountains.TITLE Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectSudden cardiac death (SCD) has been proven to be the most frequent cause of non traumatic death in males aged over 34 years, e.g. during mountain hiking, cross country skiing or downhill skiing. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and, in particular, prior myocardial infarction, are the most important risk factors for SCD, predominantly relevant in downhill skiers. The unusual physical exertion on the first day at altitude, the late morning hours and the prolonged abstinence from food and fluid intake during exercise at altitude are most important triggers. Acute hypoxia may represent a trigger for SCD on the one hand but might also evoke beneficial effects by preconditioning on the other hand.TITLE Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectThe identification of high-risk subjects and SCD triggers, evidence-based therapy of treatable risk factors, the appropriate individual preparation by physical training, and considering behavioural aspects, especially at the beginning of the physically active altitude sojourn will help to prevent SCD and increase the health benefits generated by mountaineering activities.TITLE Risk and Protective Factors for Sudden Cardiac Death During Leisure Activities in the Mountains: An Update - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mountain Arcs and Festoons in Pakistan - ScienceDirectTITLE Mountain Arcs and Festoons in Pakistan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectTITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectThe mechanism and effects of seismic measures of mountain tunnel were investigated by shaking table test.TITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectKey technical details of shaking table test on mountain tunnel were developed.TITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectFour seismic measures were suggested to be applied in the tunnel.TITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectThe seismic reinforcement length for general mountain tunnel at the portal section is recommended.TITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectTITLE Shaking table tests on seismic measures of a model mountain tunnel - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Transverse tectonic structural elements across Himalayan mountain front, eastern Arunachal Himalaya, India: Implication of superposed landform development on analysis of neotectonics - ScienceDirectTITLE Transverse tectonic structural elements across Himalayan mountain front, eastern Arunachal Himalaya, India: Implication of superposed landform development on analysis of neotectonics - ScienceDirectThe role of transverse tectonics is emphasized while analysing the neotectocs and seismic hazard assessment in the eastern Himalayan region, Arunacahal Pradesh.TITLE Transverse tectonic structural elements across Himalayan mountain front, eastern Arunachal Himalaya, India: Implication of superposed landform development on analysis of neotectonics - ScienceDirectStructural and morphotectonic signatures in conjunction with the geomorphic indices are synthesised to trace the role of transverse tectonic features in shaping the landforms developed along the frontal part of the eastern Arunachal sub-Himalaya. Mountain front sinuosity (Smf) index values close to one are indicative of the active nature of the mountain front all along the eastern Arunachal Himalaya, which can be directly attributed to the regional uplift along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT). However, the mountain front is significantly sinusoidal around junctions between HFT/MBT (Main Boundary Thrust) and active transverse faults. The high values of stream length gradient (SL) and stream steepness (Ks) indices together with field evidence of fault scarps, offset of terraces, and deflection of streams are markers of neotectonic uplift along the thrusts and transverse faults. This reactivation of transverse faults has given rise to extensional basins leading to widening of the river courses, providing favourable sites for deposition of recent sediments. Tectonic interactions of these transverse faults with the Himalayan longitudinal thrusts (MBT/HFT) have segmented the mountain front marked with varying sinuosity. The net result is that a variety of tectonic landforms recognized along the mountain front can be tracked to the complex interactions among the transverse and longitudinal tectonic elements. Some distinctive examples are: in the eastern extremity of NE Himalaya across the Dibang River valley, the NW-SE trending mountain front is attenuated by the active Mishmi Thrust that has thrust the Mishmi crystalline complex directly over the alluvium of the Brahmaputra plains. The junction of the folded HFT and Mishmi Thrust shows a zone of brecciated and pulverized rocks along which transverse axial planar fracture cleavages exhibit neotectonic activities in a transverse fault zone coinciding with the Dibang River course. Similarly, the transverse faults cut the mountain front along the Sesseri, Siluk, Siku, Siang, Mingo, Sileng, Dikari, and Simen rivers. At some such junctions, landforms associated with the active right-lateral strike-slip faults are superposed over the earlier landforms formed by transverse normal faults. In addition to linear transverse features, we see evidence that the fold-thrust belt of the frontal part of the Arunachal Himalaya has also been affected by the neotectonically active NW-SE trending major fold known as the Siang antiform that again is aligned transverse to the mountain front. The folding of the HFT and MBT along this antiform has reshaped the landscape developed between its two western and eastern limbs running N-S and NW-SE, respectively. The transverse faults are parallel to the already reported deep-seated transverse seismogenic strike-slip fault. Therefore, a single take home message is that any true manifestation of the neotectonics and seismic hazard assessment in the Himalayan region must take into account the role of transverse tectonics.TITLE Transverse tectonic structural elements across Himalayan mountain front, eastern Arunachal Himalaya, India: Implication of superposed landform development on analysis of neotectonics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Holocene development of mountain wetlands within and outside of landslide in the Hachimantai volcanic group, northeastern Japan - ScienceDirectTITLE Holocene development of mountain wetlands within and outside of landslide in the Hachimantai volcanic group, northeastern Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectMPB outbreaks resulted in an initial reduction in summer evapotranspiration.TITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectIntermediate aged stands experienced an elevation in summer evapotranspiration.TITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectSummer evapotranspiration responded to post-disturbance changes to vegetation.TITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectSeasonal variation in incoming solar radiation amplified growing season changes.TITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectWinter evapotranspiration responded to temperature and changes to vegetation.TITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Persistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectTITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectPesticide concentrations in water typically exhibit short-term peaks.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectIn small cultivated mountain basins, peaks can be shorter but much higher.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectExisting models are not suitable to predict exposure in mountain basins.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDynAPlus model allows evaluating such situations.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDynAPlus could potentially be used to improve ecological risk assessment.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectTITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (295KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectCurrent address: European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Via Carlo Magno 1, 43125 Parma, Italy.TITLE Predicting pesticide fate in small cultivated mountain watersheds using the DynAPlus model: Toward improved assessment of peak exposure - ScienceDirectDisclaimer - A.

This mountainous area is situated on the transition zone between the Mediterranean and Black Sea climates. Thus, it has ecologically interesting features. The purpose of this study is to explain the ecogeographical features of the ecosystem of Kaz Mountain. To that end, all physical features such as geomorphological, geological, climate, soil, hydrographical, vegetation, and fauna features were examined. The data obtained was compiled and classified. Hence, ecogeographical features of the area were revealed. Some parts of Kaz mountains were previously declared a national park for the purpose of protection. However, the national park does not cover all of the mountainous mass. The population pressure on the area is constantly increasing. For this reason, national park boundaries should be expanded to protect the whole ecosystem.TITLE Ecogeography of Kaz Mountain Ecosystem - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of GEOMED2013.TITLE Vulnerability of mountain glaciers in China to climate change - ScienceDirectTITLE Vulnerability of mountain glaciers in China to climate change - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration).TITLE Patrilineal background of the She minority population from Chaoshan Fenghuang Mountain, an isolated mountain region, in China - ScienceDirectTITLE Patrilineal background of the She minority population from Chaoshan Fenghuang Mountain, an isolated mountain region, in China - ScienceDirectThis is a paper on the origins of the She ethnic minority people in China.

The origin of the She population has been controversial. The purpose of this work was to investigate the genomic diversity of She. The Chaoshan She population living in the Chaoshan Fenghuang mountain is a relatively isolated population. We detected 14 Y chromosome biallelic markers (Y-SNPs) and 6 Y chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci in Chaoshan She people. Y-SNP analysis showed the Chaoshan She was closely related to the Chaoshan Hakka, Chaoshanese, Tujia and Gaoshan national minority. Compared with the Fujian She, the Chaoshan She maintained a more southern native genetic structure. Y-STR analysis revealed the Chaoshan She population was more closely related to the Hakka population than the other Hans. We concluded the Chaoshan She population had a closer genetic relationship with the southern national minority and Hakka Han and it may be representative of She ancestors' patrilineal genetic structure.TITLE Patrilineal background of the She minority population from Chaoshan Fenghuang Mountain, an isolated mountain region, in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Patrilineal background of the She minority population from Chaoshan Fenghuang Mountain, an isolated mountain region, in China - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this paper.TITLE Chronology of latest Pleistocene mountain glaciation in the western Wasatch Mountains, Utah, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectTITLE Chronology of latest Pleistocene mountain glaciation in the western Wasatch Mountains, Utah, U.S.A. - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Assessment of the debris-flow susceptibility in tropical mountains using clast distribution patterns - ScienceDirectTITLE Assessment of the debris-flow susceptibility in tropical mountains using clast distribution patterns - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectTITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectTITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectFuture spread uncertain due to habitat novelty, stochastic weather, spread control.TITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectA synthetic population dynamics model predicts unanticipated future behaviors.TITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectSmall, coupled changes in climate and forest conditions lead to sudden outbreaks.TITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectForest management must adapt to unpredictable climate-driven disturbances.TITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectTITLE Predicting the risk of mountain pine beetle spread to eastern pine forests: Considering uncertainty in uncertain times - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectTITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectDifferent distributions of PAHs were observed with elevation and side of mountain.TITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectLong-range transport is a major contributor to PAHs in the Changbai Mountain soil.TITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectCold trapping seems to occur on the southern and western sides of the mountain.TITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectLocal sources in the mountain are minor contributors to PAHs in the mountain soil.TITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectTITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Long-range atmospheric transport and the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Changbai Mountain - ScienceDirectCo-corresponding author.

The increasing evidence of the many vulnerabilities of mountain social-ecological systems has highlighted the urgent need for policy-relevant research into ways of coping with these trends. In this context, resilience has been emerging as a concept for both understanding and managing the complex social-ecological systems in which ES are provided and consumed. Yet, literature on resilience of social-ecological systems is mainly theoretical with limited application in real-world mountain case studies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the social-ecological resilience of a case study in the Swiss Alps under global change. We model and evaluate an indicator for resilience that shows the capacity of the mountain social-ecological system to provide a set of demanded ES. In a first step, we model the development of this indicator in different scenarios of global change. In a second step, we test the effect of a rich set of policy strategies under all these scenarios to identify types and timing of interventions that are robust under multiple global change settings. Results indicate that the resilience of the mountain social-ecological system is endangered in all scenarios, especially if strong globalization is assumed. Robust strategies that buffer the system against these pressures require early spatial planning action in combination with more targeted direct payments to support the current regional structure and traditional mountain farming practices. Such information is crucial to guide decision-making processes in the era of highly uncertain future global change.TITLE Policy strategies to foster the resilience of mountain social-ecological systems under uncertain global change - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectTITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe soil thermal regime is characteristic of polar desert affected by Dry-permafrost.TITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectVariations in soil temperature are intense during the summer, showing the response to radiation.TITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe periglacial landforms, are not in phase with the present polar cold desert climate.TITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe landscape dynamics evolves under scarce conditions that last for very short times.TITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectThe thermal regime at Ellsworth is comparable to other continental areas such as the dry-valleys.TITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectTITLE Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Building ex ante resilience of disaster-exposed mountain communities: Drawing insights from the Nepal earthquake recovery - ScienceDirectTITLE Building ex ante resilience of disaster-exposed mountain communities: Drawing insights from the Nepal earthquake recovery - ScienceDirectPresent address: School of Social Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.TITLE Building ex ante resilience of disaster-exposed mountain communities: Drawing insights from the Nepal earthquake recovery - ScienceDirectPresent address: Environmental Studies (MSc. 2018), University of Oregon, Eugene, United States.TITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectTITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectFunctional traits reveal ecological process driving plant responses to disturbance.TITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectRelative impacts from biking and hiking were assessed using functional traits.TITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectTaller plants with large leaves but low percent dry matter content were more resistant.TITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectMountain biking only caused more damage than hiking at high levels of use.TITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectTITLE Using functional traits to assess the resistance of subalpine grassland to trampling by mountain biking and hiking - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Can monsoon moisture arrive in the Qilian Mountains in summer?

We use the general term mountain waves to include all terrain-generated gravity waves. These waves are stationary, i.e., they remain fixed to the generating obstacle. We shall see that because of this we can estimate the amplitudes of these waves using the size scales of the obstacles and the local meteorological conditions. This is not possible for any other atmospheric wave phenomena. The types and sizes of these obstacles include, for example, mountain ranges, broad valleys, large islands, isolated peaks, large thunderstorms, small ridges, and valleys, and gently rolling hills. Areas of isolated surface temperature anomalies such as arctic leads or large cities can act as an equivalent mountain and generate gravity waves. Mountain waves play an essential role if the global circulation of the atmosphere. Mountain waves can produce destructive Bora winds which occur world wide. We shall see that the essence of these complex flows are contained in the linear wave theory. Chapter 3 will give the reader the tools necessary for advanced study of this important topic.TITLE Mountain Waves - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectTITLE Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectUniform design method is adopted for sampling considering uncertainties.TITLE Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectThe support vector machine is used to reduce computation time and resources.TITLE Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectFeasibility and validity of proposed method are proven by empirical data.TITLE Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectIn the paper, an analytical method is proposed to develop seismic fragility analysis for rock mountain tunnels. We consider four types of uncertainties in the fragility analysis including different ground motions, tunnel depths, rock mass and lining thickness. By using the uniform design method (UDM), numerical experiment samples are generated. The verified dynamic numerical simulation (DNS) model is carried out to develop probabilistic seismic demand models. To optimize conventional methodology, a prediction technique support vector machine (SVM) is employed. The SVM model could help to reduce calculation resource. It is concluded that (1) the proposed uniform design-dynamic numerical simulation-support vector machine (UDM-DNS-SVM) method could provide accurate estimated fragility curves considering multiple uncertainties; (2) comparisons among the proposed fragility curves, case studies and empirical curves verified feasibility of proposed fragility curves.TITLE Modelling seismic fragility of a rock mountain tunnel based on support vector machine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Adapting to the effects of climate change on natural resources in the Blue Mountains, USA - ScienceDirectNational forests in the Blue Mountains (USA) region have developed adaptation options that address effects identified in a recent climate change vulnerability assessment. Adaptation strategies (general, overarching) and adaptation tactics (specific, on-the-ground) were elicited from resource specialists and stakeholders through a workshop process. For water supply and infrastructure, primary adaptation strategies restore hydrologic function of watersheds, connect floodplains, support groundwater-dependent ecosystems, maximize valley storage, and reduce fire hazard. For fisheries, strategies maintain or restore natural flow regimes and thermal conditions, improve water conservation, decrease fragmentation of stream networks, and develop geospatial data on stream temperature and geologic hazards. For upland vegetation, disturbance-focused strategies reduce severity and patch size of disturbances, protect refugia, increase resilience of native vegetation by reducing non-climate stressors, protect genotypic and phenotypic diversity, and focus on functional systems (not just species). For special habitats (riparian areas, wetlands, groundwater-dependent ecosystems), strategies restore or maintain natural flow regimes, maintain appropriate plant densities, improve soil health and streambank stability, and reduce non-climate stressors. Prominent interactions of resource effects makes coordination critical for implementation and effectiveness of adaptation tactics and restoration projects in the Blue Mountains.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectTITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectCPOM transport is fairly well measurable with bedload traps in wadeable streams.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectPronounced hysteresis requires intensive sampling for accurate estimating CPOM load.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectKnown CPOM hysteresis patterns useful for enhancing poorly sampled CPOM time series.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectRough estimates of CPOM transport relation possible in coniferous mountain streams.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectTITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectTITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 (303) 440 8795.TITLE Measurements of coarse particulate organic matter transport in steep mountain streams and estimates of decadal CPOM exports - ScienceDirectCurrent address: Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Telegrafenberg, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is a tree-killing bark beetle native to western North America but constrained by cold temperatures in the northern limits of its distribution. In recent years, this insect has spread north and east of its historical range, and continued expansion, or accidental introduction, could result in the mountain pine beetle becoming invasive in eastern North America. The limiting effect of cold temperatures among novel host pines is unknown, yet crucial for understanding the risk posed to northeastern North American forests. We report the susceptibility of mountain pine beetle to cold temperatures while overwintering in six different pine species. Brood developed in two western pine hosts (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm. and P. ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) as well as four eastern pines (P. banksiana Lamb., P. resinosa Ait., P. strobus L. and P. sylvestris L.) novel to this insect. The cold tolerance and cold tolerance strategy of the most common overwintering stage varied by host and year. Models describing lower lethal temperatures more accurately predicted observed field mortality of overwintering larvae than models based on temperatures at which larvae froze. Rapid development to less cold tolerant pupal and adult stages by brood in novel hosts prior to winter may constitute a trade-off between increased host suitability and winter mortality. We demonstrate that overwintering survival of mountain pine beetles in novel hosts depends on a match between the climate and ecophysiological effects of pine species. These results have implications for risk assessment models and management planning for eastern forests as mountain pine beetle continues to expand its range.TITLE Cold tolerance of mountain pine beetle among novel eastern pines: A potential for trade-offs in an invaded range? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectEccentricity and precession can drive landscape evolution in continental interiors.TITLE Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectEccentricity and precession impact modeled summer runoff in northeastern Wyoming.TITLE Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectPrecipitation may be the dominant geomorphic driver in some intermontane basins.TITLE Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Orbital control, climate seasonality, and landscape evolution in the Quaternary Rocky Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectTITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectThe climate of the Tatra Mts. is warming and the cryosphere is shrinking.TITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectThe mountain cryosphere is the most sensitive to the winter weather conditions.TITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectInterannual variation of ice deposits in the mountains may not be synchronous.TITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectTrends of regional ice deposits reflect variation in changes in the global climate system.TITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectThis paper concerns the response of the conditioned by orography cryosphere of the non-glaciated mountains of mid-latitude to the climate impulses. It presents the relationships among the air temperature, precipitation, snow cover, lake ice cover, firn-ice patches (glacierets) and permafrost in the Tatras. The data from the warmest multi-year in the history of the local meteorological measurements and statistical models (multiple regression) have been used. The results indicate that all the components of the contemporary cryosphere are very sensitive to the changes in the air temperature in winter or snow precipitation/accumulation. Due to the diverse orographic conditions, interannual variability of seasonal and perennial, surface and subsurface ice deposits in the mountain areas may not be synchronous. However, the long-term trends of this variability reflect the changes in the global climate system.TITLE Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectTITLE Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectAccurate estimation of natural precipitation is important for accurate estimation of cloud seeding impact.TITLE Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectSensitivity of cloud seeding impact to external factors identifiedTITLE Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectSpatial variability of cloud seeding impact identifiedTITLE Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectConsistent cloud seeding impacts found over two independent experimentsTITLE Further analysis of a snowfall enhancement project in the Snowy Mountains of Australia - ScienceDirectThe first phase of the Snowy Precipitation Enhancement Research Project (SPERP-1) was a confirmatory experiment on winter orographic cloud seeding (Manton et al., 2011). Analysis of the data (Manton and Warren, 2011) found that a statistically significant impact of seeding could be obtained by removing any 5-hour experimental units (EUs) for which the amount of released seeding material was below a specified minimum. Analysis of the SPERP-1 data is extended in the present work by first considering the uncertainties in the measurement of precipitation and in the methodology. It is found that the estimation of the natural precipitation in the target area, based solely on the precipitation in the designated control area, is a significant source of uncertainty. A systematic search for optimal predictors shows that both the Froude number of the low-level flow across the mountains and the control precipitation should be used to estimate the natural precipitation. Applying the optimal predictors for the natural precipitation, statistically significant impacts are found using all EUs. This approach also supports a novel analysis of the sensitivity of seeding impacts to environmental variables, such as wind speed and cloud top temperature. The spatial distribution of seeding impact across the target is investigated. Building on the results of SPERP-1, phase 2 of the experiment (SPERP-2) ran from 2010 to 2013 with the target area extended to the north along the mountain ridges. Using the revised methodology, the seeding impacts in SPERP-2 are found to be consistent with those in SPERP-1, provided that the natural precipitation is estimated accurately.TITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectTITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectDead foliage is supported in the canopy briefly following severe disturbance.TITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectTITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectAccumulation of surface fuel loadings do not increase substantially in a decade.TITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectHeavy fuel loads do not accumulate in a decade following fire/insect disturbance.TITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectTITLE Surface fuel changes after severe disturbances in northern Rocky Mountain ecosystems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Symmetric mountain pass lemma and sublinear elliptic equations - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we study the p-Laplace elliptic equations under the Dirichlet boundary condition.

ScienceDirectTITLE New approach to resolve the amount of Quaternary uplift and associated denudation of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands - ScienceDirectLow-temperature thermochronology is a widely used tool for revealing denudation histories of mountain ranges. Although this technique has been applied mainly to continental orogens, such as the European Alps, Himalayas, and Andes, recent technological development of low-temperature thermochronology has made it applicable to a wider variety of mountain ranges with various sizes and tectonic histories. The Japanese Islands comprise young and active island arcs, where an early stage of mountain range formation is observed. Numerous attempts have been made to constrain the uplift and denudation histories of the mountains in the Japanese Islands using geologic, geomorphologic, or geodetic methods. However, the number of thermochronometric attempts has been limited primarily due to the small amount of total denudation since the initiation of the uplift. In this review paper, we introduce the tectonic and geomorphic settings of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands, and discuss previous attempts to estimate uplift or denudation of the Japanese mountains using methods other than thermochronology. Furthermore, we discuss problems of the thermochronometric applications in revealing denudation histories of the Japanese mountains. Finally, we present a case study of the Kiso Range in central Japan and discuss the current effectiveness and applicability of low-temperature thermochronology to the Japanese mountainous areas.TITLE New approach to resolve the amount of Quaternary uplift and associated denudation of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (355KB)Download full-size imageTITLE New approach to resolve the amount of Quaternary uplift and associated denudation of the mountain ranges in the Japanese Islands - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).TITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectTITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectTITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectMoisture recycling (M) and sub-cloud evaporation (E) lead to the positive gradient.TITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectA model is built to quantify effect of M and E on the isotope - altitude gradient.TITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectMountainous (basin) water isotopes plot above (below) the LMWL caused by M (E).TITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectTITLE A positive altitude gradient of isotopes in the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains: Effects of moisture recycling and sub-cloud evaporation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Stretching out the Australasian microtektite strewn field in Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Stretching out the Australasian microtektite strewn field in Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectTITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectWe analysed debris flows events and snow avalanches in the High Tatras Mts.TITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectDendrogeomorphic dating of 189 scarred trees with seasonal precision was applied.TITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirect19 snow avalanches and eight debris flow since 1959 were dated.TITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectTITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectTITLE Snow avalanche and debris flow activity in the High Tatras Mountains: New data from using dendrogeomorphic survey - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectTITLE GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectNew dataset of images with known camera poses in mountainous terrain is introduced.TITLE GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectThe images in the dataset are accompanied by additional synthetic data and images.TITLE GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectA semi-automatic approach for the dataset acquisition is proposed.TITLE GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectBaseline evaluation of visual localization and orientation estimation is presented.TITLE GeoPose3K: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments - ScienceDirectWe introduce a new dataset called GeoPose3K1 which contains over three thousand precise camera poses of mountain landscape images.

Mountains are recognized as very sensitive physical environments with populations whose histories and current social positions often strain their capacity to accommodate intense and rapid changes to their resource base. It is thus essential to assess the impacts of a changing climate, focusing on the quantity of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow and ice melt represent a large streamflow component as well as a local resource in terms of freshwater supply, hydropower generation, or irrigation. Increasing evidence of glacier retreat, permafrost degradation and reduced mountain snowpack has been observed in many regions, thereby suggesting that climate change may seriously affect streamflow regimes. These changes could in turn threaten the availability of water resources for many environmental and economic systems, and exacerbate a range of natural hazards that would compound these impacts. As a consequence, socio-economic structures of downstream living populations would be also impacted, calling for better preparedness and strategies to avoid conflicts of interest between water-dependent economic actors. This paper is thus an introduction to the Special Issue of this journal dedicated to the European Union Seventh Framework Program (EU-FP7) project ACQWA (Assessing Climate Impacts on the Quantity and Quality of WAter), a major European network of scientists that was coordinated by the University of Geneva from 2008 to 2014. The goal of ACQWA has been to address a number of these issues and propose a range of solutions for adaptation to change and to help improve water governance in regions where quantity, seasonality, and perhaps quality of water may substantially change in coming decades.TITLE Assessing the impacts of climatic change on mountain water resources - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography - ScienceDirectTITLE A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography - ScienceDirectNovel, low-cost method to quantify spatial and temporal cloud immersion in forests.TITLE A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography - ScienceDirectCloud-sensitive image characteristics established with above- and below-canopy scenes.TITLE A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography - ScienceDirectElevation range of cloud immersion in Luquillo forest higher than previously assumed.TITLE A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography - ScienceDirectTITLE A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mean bedrock-to-saprolite conversion and erosion rates during mountain growth and decline - ScienceDirectTITLE Mean bedrock-to-saprolite conversion and erosion rates during mountain growth and decline - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mean bedrock-to-saprolite conversion and erosion rates during mountain growth and decline - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Quaternary sackungen in the highest mountains of the Carpathians - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Quaternary sackungen in the highest mountains of the Carpathians - ScienceDirectWe dated 19 sackung scarps using 30 TCN ages and one 14C date in the Tatra Mts.

ScienceDirectWe defined one indicator to evaluate the overall rockfall protection of each forest.TITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectThe indicators are easily and accurately predicted with three forest characteristics.TITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectThis approach has direct applications in forest management and rockfall assessment.TITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectNatural hazards are frequent in mountain areas where they regularly cause casualties and damages to human infrastructures. Mountain forests contribute in mitigating these hazards, in particular rockfalls. Assessing the protective effect of a forest against rockfall is a difficult task for both forest managers and rockfall experts. Accurate and simple tools are therefore required to efficiently evaluate the level of protection that results from the presence of forest.TITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectThis study defines three novel indicators to quantify the protective effect of forests against rockfalls, regarding (1) the reduction of the frequency of rockfalls, (2) the reduction of their maximum intensity, and (3) the combination of the reduction of the frequency and the energy of the rocks. The first two indicators are relevant for rockfall experts whereas the third is mostly interesting for foresters as it summarizes the protective effect of forest. The Rockyfor3D model was adapted and used to simulate rockfalls propagation on 3886 different forest stands located in all the French Alps. The results of the simulations were used to calculate the three indicators for each forest stand. Finally, the relations between the forest structures and compositions and the indicators values were investigated.TITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectOur principal result shows that only three forest characteristics are required to accurately predict the indicators and evaluate the protective level of a forest against rockfall. The two first variables correspond to the basal area and the mean diameter at breast height (DBH) of the forest stand which are two parameters commonly used by forest managers. The third characteristic is the length of forest in the maximum slope direction which can be computed with a geographic information system (GIS). The method proposed in this study is easily reproducible and is suitable to evaluate the protective effect of European mountain forests at different scales. At local scale, the proposed indicators can enrich rockfall studies in which forests are usually set aside to simplify the evaluation. Moreover, the indicators may find direct applications with foresters by allowing them to identify the protective level of their forest and consequently to adapt their management. Finally, the indicators are convenient to perform spatial analysis and produce maps of the protective effect of mountain forests that could find many applications in land settlement or evaluation of ecosystem services.TITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (430KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Novel quantitative indicators to characterize the protective effect of mountain forests against rockfall - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectTITLE Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectClimate influences on whitebark pine mortality were geographically consistent.TITLE Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectRecent outbreaks were linked to warmer winter temperatures only in colder regions.TITLE Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectFuture climate suitability for outbreaks increases only in colder regions.TITLE Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectRecent mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests have been extensive and severe. Understanding the climate influences on these outbreaks is essential for developing management plans that account for potential future mountain pine beetle outbreaks, among other threats, and informing listing decisions under the Endangered Species Act. Prior research has focused on one geographic region, but geographic variability in beetle and tree physiological responses to climate conditions have been documented. Here we evaluate geographic variability in climate influences on recent beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine and estimate future climate suitability for outbreaks across much of the range of whitebark pine in the western US. To accomplish these objectives, we developed and analyzed statistical models for three different geographic regions as well as a Westwide model, then applied the Westwide model to a suite of climate projections. The general patterns of climate-tree mortality relationships were similar across the three regions of our study. However, the relative importance of individual climate metrics preceding and during the recent outbreaks varied geographically because of the different climates in the regions. Winter minimum temperatures appeared to be limiting prior to outbreaks in the colder regions. All regions experienced low summer precipitation prior to or during outbreak initiation. Future climate suitability for beetle outbreaks is estimated to increase or remain stable in the coldest regions and decline slightly in the warmest region by the end of this century. Across the study area, projections of higher winter temperatures and decreased summer precipitation (with lower confidence than for temperatures) contribute to increased climate suitability for outbreaks, while projected higher fall/spring/summer temperatures contribute to decreased suitability. Some regional variability exists; in particular, the effect of winter warming is muted in the warmest region (Cascades) where winter temperatures appear to be less limiting. However, all regions are projected to experience fewer years with very low suitability, which commonly occurred prior to the recent outbreaks and may have limited beetle populations. Given the inherent uncertainty in climate projections and ecological responses to novel climates, management plans that incorporate sites that are expected to experience a range of expected future climate conditions might increase the chances of whitebark pine persistence in a warmer future.TITLE Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectTITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectTITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectThe rocks are derived from an enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle.TITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectTITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectThe shoshonitic rocks formed during the roll-back of the early Mesozoic subducted flat-slab.TITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectTITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (223KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Petrogenesis of Cretaceous shoshonitic rocks in the northern Wuyi Mountains, South China: A result of the roll-back of a flat-slab? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Habitat preferences in freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates: Algae as substratum and food resource in high mountain rivers from Mexico - ScienceDirectThe diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems is closely related to the availability and heterogeneity of habitats. These habitats may be of inorganic origin, such as the rocky substratum associated with the river bed, or organic such as macroscopic algae. The objective of this study was to determinate the importance of five species of algae that differ in their morphological type as a substratum and food resource regarding the associated establishment of macroinvertebrate assemblages taking account the climatic seasonality (warm dry, cool dry and rainy). We then evaluate the differences in macroinvertebrates assemblages with respect to the inorganic substratum by sampling high mountain rivers in central Mexico. The mucilaginous colonies of Nostoc parmelioides and Placoma regulare, the pseudoparenchymatous bambusiform thallus of Paralemanea mexicana and the laminate thallus of Prasiola mexicana had the highest densities of macroinvertebrates, represented by the genera Cricotopus, Paramerina, Simulium and Tanytarsini tribe. The relationship between algal morphological type and the richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates was positively related to specific conductivity, total dissolved solids and discharge variables. The dominant taxa associated with the inorganic substratum belonged mainly to the Trichoptera, Diptera and Ephemeroptera orders. Water temperature, discharge and concentration of orthophosphates were the main environmental variables able to explain the diversity of macroinvertebrates on this substratum.

Our results show that: 1) the phylogenetic structure tended to cluster with increasing latitude and longitude; 2) for NRI, latitude was closer related than longitude, while for NTI, longitude was closer related than latitude, though they both not significantly relate to NTI. The phylogenetic structure tended towards overdispersion in the southern HDMR, with good climate conditions of higher mean annual temperature and more mean annual precipitation. In contrast, with harsh climate conditions of lower mean annual temperature and less mean annual precipitation, the increasing environmental stress led to phylogenetic clustering in the northern HDMR. The results highlighted that in the alpine region of HDMR, environmental filters and geographical isolation had a great effect on the latitudinal and longitudinal alpine species distribution, respectively.TITLE Phylogenetic pattern of alpine plants along latitude and longitude in Hengduan Mountains Region - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Editorial Office of Plant Diversity.TITLE Holocene climate reconstruction based on herbaceous phytolith indices from an AMS 14C-dated peat profile in the Changbai Mountains, northeast China - ScienceDirectTITLE Holocene climate reconstruction based on herbaceous phytolith indices from an AMS 14C-dated peat profile in the Changbai Mountains, northeast China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectTITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectWood budgets and transport diagrams established for four study catchmentsTITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectLandslides and debris flows were dominant recruitment processes in headwater streams.TITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectBank erosion predominated in the lower part of mountain riversTITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectEstimated deadwood contribution of 12%TITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectTITLE Large wood recruitment processes and transported volumes in Swiss mountain streams during the extreme flood of August 2005 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Late Pleistocene Mountain Glaciation in the Lake Bonneville Basin - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Pleistocene Mountain Glaciation in the Lake Bonneville Basin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Level of minerals and trace elements in the urine of the participants of mountain ultra-marathon race - ScienceDirectTITLE Level of minerals and trace elements in the urine of the participants of mountain ultra-marathon race - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectTITLE Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectWe investigated aquatic and semi-aquatic lichens associated with mountain streams.TITLE Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectThe second multivariate analysis of freshwater lichen community data in Europe is provided.TITLE Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectDiversity and small-scale distribution patterns of lichens were driven by duration of contact with water (hydrological zones).TITLE Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectTITLE Freshwater lichens and habitat zonation of mountain streams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectTITLE Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectWe analyse the altitude and aspect of glacial cirques in Britain and Ireland.TITLE Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectData indicate that moisture availability regulated sites of glacier initiation.TITLE Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectClimatic patterns during glacier initiation were similar to present.TITLE Climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation in Britain and Ireland: Inferences from the cirque record - ScienceDirectWe map glacial cirques, and analyse spatial variability in their altitude and aspect to derive a long-term, time-integrated, perspective on climate patterns during former periods of mountain glaciation (likely spanning multiple Quaternary glaciations) in Britain and Ireland. The data reveal that, although air temperatures were important, exposure to moisture-bearing air masses was the key factor in regulating sites of former mountain glacier formation, and indicate that during such periods, moisture supply was largely controlled by North Atlantic westerlies, with notable inland precipitation gradients (precipitation decreasing inland), similar to present day. In places, trends in cirque altitude may also reflect regional differences in the extent of cirque deepening, controlled by the dimensions and dynamics of the glaciers that came to occupy them. Specifically, comparatively deep cirques in coastal locations may reflect the former presence of dynamic (fed by moisture from the North Atlantic), but comparatively small, glaciers (largely confined to their cirques). By contrast, decreasing cirque depth further inland, may reflect the former presence of larger and/or less dynamic ice masses, occupying comparatively continental climatic conditions.TITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectSeasonal and event level buildup and scour of channel bed were observed.TITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectChannel beds annually approach a roughly stable lower limit for the study period.TITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectThalwegs were seasonally disconnected from sediment sources at the channel banks.TITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectLoad cell pressure sensors show potential for high-resolution bedload measurements.TITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectPlacement depth and channel bank structures can affect measurement volume.TITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectTITLE Tracking channel bed resiliency in forested mountain catchments using high temporal resolution channel bed movement - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectThe geomorphic surfaces in the Bogda northern piedmont area are divided.TITLE Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Late Quaternary tectonic activity and crustal shortening rate of the Bogda mountain area, eastern Tian Shan, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectTITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectGlobal review of sackung-type DSGSDsTITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectFirst 10Be exposure dating of sackung in the CarpathiansTITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectComparison of sackungen originated in paraglacial and non-glaciated landscapesTITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectCritical reassessment of the relevancy of sackungen in the paraglacial geomorphologyTITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectTITLE Are sackungen diagnostic features of (de)glaciated mountains? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectTITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectThe consistently dominant climatic factor of tree-ring growth in Tianshan Mountains is verified.TITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectTree rings provide three century climate records: precipitation, SPEI and PDSI.TITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectHistorical change characteristic of moisture since A.D. 1882 is explored.TITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectPossible variability driving mechanism of moisture is revealed.TITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectThe western Tianshan Mountains are a very important source of water. The area is dominated by westerly winds and is important in global change research. In this paper, we combine two tree-ring width chronologies, meteorological data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), a standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) to analyze radial growth response to climate. Studies show moisture from the previous July to current June was consistently the dominant climatic factor accounting for interannual variation of tree-ring width in the western Tianshan Mountains. Then, we reconstruct the precipitation, SPEI and PDSI, and the three series are verified with mathematical methods and other observation data. Power spectral and wavelet analyses reveal significant 2- to 6-year high-frequency cycles and a 17-year low-frequency cycle. Moisture has varied as four wetter periods and four drier periods over the past century. We show that over all northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, moisture change has been rarely consistent. From the 1980s to present, the climate has had the longest, most significant and rapid wetting period in the past century. The moisture variability pertains to most areas of the western Tianshan Mountains, especially the northern slope of the mountains in Kyrgyzstan. Our results indicate a strong negative relationship between the Summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) and moisture in the western Tianshan Mountains. The moisture variability may have been controlled by the SNAO in the past century, and may be associated with large-scale oscillation in the climate system.TITLE Tree-ring-based moisture variability in western Tianshan Mountains since A.D. 1882 and its possible driving mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectTITLE Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectNo-management generates high ES utilities for three out of four ES.TITLE Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectSmall-scale silviculture combines timber production and biodiversity conservation well.TITLE Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectAll analysed managements can be considered as multifunctional.TITLE Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectTITLE Value-based ecosystem service trade-offs in multi-objective management in European mountain forests - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectTITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectFluorite occurs as lenses/veins in a number of localities in the Nuba Mountains.TITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectFluorite is classified into four categories based on their petrography.TITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectIt exhibits a relatively high concentration of rare earth elements (REE).TITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectREE doesn't occur in the fluorite structure but rather as independent mineral(s).TITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectTITLE Origin of fluorite mineralizations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan and their rare earth element geochemistry - ScienceDirectAmong other mineralizations in the basement complex of the Nuba Mountains, fluorite occurs as lenses and veins in a number of localities.

Water diversions throughout the Rocky Mountains transport large volumes of water out of the basins of origin, resulting in hydrologic modifications to downstream areas. This study examines the hypothesis that lodgepole pine located below water diversions exhibit an increased incidence of mountain pine beetle infestation and mortality. A ground survey verified diversion structures in a portion of Grand County, Colorado, and sampling plots were established around two types of diversion structures, canals and dams. Field studies assessed mountain pine beetle infestation. Lodgepole pines below diversions show 45.1% higher attack and 38.5% higher mortality than lodgepole pines above diversions. These findings suggest that water diversions are associated with increased infestation and mortality of lodgepole pines in the basins of extraction, with implications for forest and water allocation management.TITLE Mountain pine beetle infestation of lodgepole pine in areas of water diversion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectWet-only N deposition fills the gap in mountain regions, Southwestern China.TITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectThe urban site was N hotspot and had a different N source from rural and town sites.TITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectPrecipitation N had a potentially negative risk on aquatic and forest ecosystems.TITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectTITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (181KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Wet-only deposition of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and associated isotopic characteristics in a typical mountain area, southwestern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Is acute mountain sickness related to trait anxiety?

Long-term studies may be extremely useful in assessing the responses of high-elevation ecosystems to climate change and other anthropogenic drivers from a broad ecological perspective. Mountain research sites within the LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network are representative of various types of ecosystems and span a wide bioclimatic and elevational range.TITLE Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectHere, we present a synthesis and a review of the main results from ecological studies in mountain ecosystems at 20 LTER sites in Italy, Switzerland and Austria covering in most cases more than two decades of observations. We analyzed a set of key climate parameters, such as temperature and snow cover duration, in relation to vascular plant species composition, plant traits, abundance patterns, pedoclimate, nutrient dynamics in soils and water, phenology and composition of freshwater biota.TITLE Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectThe overall results highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems to climate change, with site-specific characteristics and rates. As temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits increased as well. Years with limited snow cover duration caused an increase in soil temperature and microbial biomass during the growing season. Effects on freshwater ecosystems were also observed, in terms of increases in solutes, decreases in nitrates and changes in plankton phenology and benthos communities. This work highlights the importance of comparing and integrating long-term ecological data collected in different ecosystems for a more comprehensive overview of the ecological effects of climate change. Nevertheless, there is a need for (i) adopting co-located monitoring site networks to improve our ability to obtain sound results from cross-site analysis, (ii) carrying out further studies, in particular short-term analyses with fine spatial and temporal resolutions to improve our understanding of responses to extreme events, and (iii) increasing comparability and standardizing protocols across networks to distinguish local patterns from global patterns.TITLE Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (161KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines - ScienceDirectJoint first authors.TITLE Coleoptera in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia): species richness and community patterns along an ecological gradient - ScienceDirectThe Altai Mountains located in western Mongolia comprise diverse habitats including forest, mountain steppe, dry steppe, semidesert, and desert. This study used advanced statistics to examine how diversity and species composition of beetle communities depend on vegetation pattern and environmental factors along an ecological gradient from steppe to desert. Our study included the beetle families Tenebrionidae, Carabidae, Curculionidae, and Coccinellidae, which account for the majority of the known beetle fauna in the area. The most abundant Coleoptera in all plots were Harpalus limbaris, Corsyra fusula, and Anatolica cellicola; otherwise, we caught a large number of rare species. The beta diversity of communities was correlated with distance between plots. Species richness of beetles was positively impacted by plant cover and correlated negatively with rising temperatures, whereas Shannon diversity of beetle communities was significantly higher in areas with higher precipitation. Distribution and community composition of Coleopterans were governed by environmental factors, especially plant diversity, mean annual temperature, and summer precipitation, as revealed by redundancy analysis.TITLE Coleoptera in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia): species richness and community patterns along an ecological gradient - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA).TITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectTITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectTITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectTITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectThe daily total of rainfall is much less important than the intensity of rainfall.TITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectTITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectTITLE Reflection of climate changes in the structure and morphodynamics of talus slopes (the Tatra Mountains, Poland) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectWe explored tree-growth climate relationships for seven dominant tree species in 20 mountainous forests in GreeceTITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectWater availability during May-August was a key determinant of tree-growthTITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectSpecies specific responses were related to measurements instantaneous water use efficiencyTITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (234KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tree growth-climate relationships in a forest-plot network on Mediterranean mountains - ScienceDirectTITLE The formation of mountain range curvature by gravitational spreading - ScienceDirectThis paper presents a mechanism by which mountain ranges can form curved range-fronts. Gravitational spreading of mountain ranges that have been thrust onto rigid lowlands will result in the formation of curvature, provided that enough gravity-driven flow occurs to dominate the shape of the topography. Whether this mechanism can operate during the lifetime of a given mountain range depends upon the viscosity of the range, the square of the along-strike length of the range, and the cube of the elevation of the range. The curvature of the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau is consistent with formation by gravitational spreading provided that the viscosity is similar to that previously estimated using other, independent, methods. The low elevation and young age of the Zagros mountains mean that large-scale curvature has not had time to develop. The short along-strike extent and possibly low viscosity of the Sulaiman Ranges in Pakistan may have allowed the ranges to form their distinctive arcuate shape. The formation of range-front curvature plays an important role in controlling the tectonic evolution of the interiors of the ranges, with arc-parallel extension becoming progressively more important as range-front curvature develops.TITLE The formation of mountain range curvature by gravitational spreading - ScienceDirectTITLE The formation of mountain range curvature by gravitational spreading - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectTITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectGround beetle assemblages were studied to determine the effects of passive restoration of a mountain river.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectSix unmanaged and six channelized cross-sections were compared.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectBeetle assemblages in unmanaged cross-sections were more abundant and richer in species.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectActive river zone width was a good predictor of the composition of beetle assemblages.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectRestoring dynamic processes improved the condition of ground beetles over a few years.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectEffects of passive restoration of mountain rivers on the organisms inhabiting exposed riverine sediments are considerably less understood than those concerning aquatic biota. Thus, the effects of a recovery of the Raba River after abandonment of maintenance of its channelization scheme on ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) communities were investigated by comparing 6 unmanaged cross-sections and 6 cross-sections from adjacent channelized reaches. In each cross-section, ground beetles were collected from 12 sampling sites in spring, summer, and autumn, and 8 habitat parameters characterizing the cross-sections and sampling sites were determined. Within a few years after abandonment of the Raba River channelization scheme, the width of this gravel-bed river increased up to three times and its multi-thread pattern became re-established. Consequently, unmanaged river cross-sections had significantly larger channel width and more low-flow channels and eroding cutbanks than channelized cross-sections. Moreover, sampling sites in the unmanaged cross-sections were typified by significantly steeper average surface slope and larger average distance from low-flow channels than the sites in channelized cross-sections. In total, 3992 individuals from 78 taxa were collected during the study. The ground beetle assemblages were significantly more abundant and richer in species in the unmanaged than in the channelized cross-sections but no significant differences in carabid diversity indices between the two cross-section types were recorded. Redundancy Analysis indicated active river zone width as the only variable explaining differences in abundance and species richness among the cross-sections. Multiple regression analysis indicated species diversity to predominantly depend on the degree of plant cover and substrate grain size. The study showed that increased availability of exposed sediments in the widened river reaches allowed ground beetles to increase their abundance and species richness within a few years after the onset of river restoration, but more time may be needed for development of more diverse carabid communities.TITLE Ground beetle communities in a mountain river subjected to restoration: The Raba River, Polish Carpathians - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (245KB)Download full-size image
