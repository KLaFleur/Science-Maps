In such situations, earthquake emergency management is vital for reducing the risks and the disastrous consequences. Scenario-based methods have often been used by decision makers in different fields as an instrument to manage the uncertainty of the effects of earthquakes. This paper adopts a scenario-based model to evaluate the effectiveness of earthquake emergency management. The model extracts the key elements of earthquake emergency management, simulates possible earthquake disaster scenarios, and obtains an evaluation according to the real situation. It is verified by comparing it with the real situation of the Wenchuan earthquake in China through scenario deduction and simulation. It shows that the scenario-based model can be used to reproduce the development process of an earthquake, identify the key factors which can effectively reduce earthquake losses and then help policy makers to have a better understanding of the earthquake disaster from which to put forward practical measures for emergency management.A scenario-based model for earthquake emergency management effectiveness evaluation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A scenario-based model for earthquake emergency management effectiveness evaluation - ScienceDirectY.

Only some geological and geophysical conditions may allow for the occurrence of fluid-related earthquake precursory phenomena. As a consequence, the geophysical models utilized to explain the occurrence of earthquake precursors should be updated.

Investigations were carried out, and it was found that the breakwater failed mainly due to the failure of its foundation. However, mechanism of the failure of the breakwater has not yet been completely explained. This paper focuses on the stability evaluation of a breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami. The main feature of the study is application of centrifuge technique for a geo-disaster caused by an earthquake and a tsunami. Results of the study show that in the case of a geo-disaster brought by an earthquake and a tsunami, excessive pore water pressure generated in the sandy ground, and consequently liquefaction occurred during the earthquake. That resulted in deformation of the foundation ground and settlement of the breakwater. During the tsunami, scouring could occur around the harbor side mound, and seepage took place beneath the breakwater. These were the main reasons of decrease in bearing capacity of the foundation ground and failure of the breakwater. Numerical simulations were also performed to make clear the mechanism and behavior of the breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami. Overall, this study can be useful to understand the failure process of a breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami, and it can be helpful to develop countermeasures in order to reduce the earthquake and tsunami induced damage of a breakwater in the future.Centrifuge modelling for stability evaluation of a breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Lithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectLithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectLithospheric stress patterns in Mongolia have been studied using mechanisms and seismic moments of earthquakes.Lithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectLithospheric stresses in Mongolia vary in space and time.Lithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectLithospheric stresses in Mongolia underwent three events of change in a few recent decades.Lithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectLithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectThe seismic moments of MLH=2.5 earthquakes correspond to predominant oblique-slip motions.Lithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectLithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (439KB)Download full-size imageLithospheric stress in Mongolia, from earthquake source data - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectThe impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectThe impact of earthquakes on moving intention is mediated by psychological distress.The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectBeing young, high educated or single is related to a higher intention to move.The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectHaving weak or no attachment to the region is related to a higher intention to move.The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectHigher residential satisfaction is related to a lower intention to move.The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectExperience of earthquakes increases expectation of future damage to the dwelling.The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectThe extraction of natural gas in the north of The Netherlands has led to soil subsidence and the occurrence of earthquakes. Residents worry about the safety of their families and the saleability of their dwelling and might want to move. The goal is to examine whether the earthquakes are related to the intention to move. A survey among residents in the area was carried out in 2015. The results show that the intention to move is influenced by age, education, household size, length of residence and attachment to the region. In addition, there is an effect of experience of earthquakes, which is mediated by psychological distress (anxiety, insecurity and concern). We conclude that the way in which residents handle the earthquake experience determines their intention to move, not the experience in itself. This provides opportunities to prevent out-migration by supporting residents and by providing them psychological care and security regarding the value and saleability of their dwellings.The impact of earthquakes on the intention to move: Fight or flight? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Oscillatory tendency of interevent direction in earthquake sequences - ScienceDirectOscillatory tendency of interevent direction in earthquake sequences - ScienceDirectWe study earthquake process from the directional perspective and show its significance.Oscillatory tendency of interevent direction in earthquake sequences - ScienceDirectWe uncover an oscillatory pattern of earthquake migration.Oscillatory tendency of interevent direction in earthquake sequences - ScienceDirectWe find the absence of long-range correlation in the directional information.Oscillatory tendency of interevent direction in earthquake sequences - ScienceDirectThe epicenter motion direction carries important information about the seismogenic dynamics but, to our knowledge, lacks systematic study. In this work, we studied the earthquake process from this perspective. To grasp the feature in directional information, we proposed a new descriptor, i.e., the direction of motion change defined as the difference in azimuths between two consecutive earthquake events. For the aftershock sequences of the Landers and the Northridge Earthquakes, the regional earthquake catalogs of south China, southern California, and New Zealand, and the corresponding aftershock depleted catalogs, we studied the distribution and long-range correlation of the direction of motion change. Similar results are found for the aftershock and regional earthquake process even if aftershocks depleted from the catalogs: Both of them hold a tendency for successive events to migrate in opposite directions along fault zones and show no long-range correlation, rendering plausibly a fundamental characteristic governed by seismogenic dynamics. For aftershocks, the phenomenon is conjectured to be the alternate release of residual stress at both ends of the fissures. With regard to regional earthquakes, the underlying physics and mechanisms are not very clear. It should be something related to the seismodynamic process, such as stress configuration modified by earthquakes. The study from this new perspective of directional information is believed to benefit a better understanding of the earthquake process.Oscillatory tendency of interevent direction in earthquake sequences - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Estimating the macroseismic parameters of earthquakes in eastern Iran - ScienceDirectMacroseismic intensity values allow assessing the macroseismic parameters of earthquakes such as location, magnitude, and fault orientation.

Accounting for this seismicity is of great importance for seismic hazard and risk assessments, seismic zoning, and land use. In this study, a homogenous earthquake catalogue of moment-magnitude (Mw) for the Arabian Plate is provided. The comprehensive and homogenous earthquake catalogue provided in the current study spatially involves the entire Arabian Peninsula and neighboring areas, covering all earthquake sources that can generate substantial hazard for the Arabian Plate mainland. The catalogue extends in time from 19 to 2015 with a total number of 13,156 events, of which 497 are historical events. Four polygons covering the entire Arabian Plate were delineated and different data sources including special studies, local, regional and international catalogues were used to prepare the earthquake catalogue. Moment magnitudes (Mw) that provided by original sources were given the highest magnitude type priority and introduced to the catalogues with their references. Earthquakes with magnitude differ from Mw were converted into this scale applying empirical relationships derived in the current or in previous studies. The four polygons catalogues were included in two comprehensive earthquake catalogues constituting the historical and instrumental periods. Duplicate events were identified and discarded from the current catalogue. The present earthquake catalogue was declustered in order to contain only independent events and investigated for the completeness with time of different magnitude spans.Compiling an earthquake catalogue for the Arabian Plate, Western Asia - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (323KB)Download full-size imageCompiling an earthquake catalogue for the Arabian Plate, Western Asia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectPain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectThe impacts of Tangshan Earthquake on the educational attainmentPain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectTangshan Earthquake lowers schooling years of affected cohorts.Pain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectThe rate of returns to education for the earthquake cohorts is above 20%.Pain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectPain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectPain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectPain of disasters: The educational cost of exogenous shocks evidence from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectShallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectSeismicity parameters of earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region are provided.Shallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectLarge earthquakes in a small zone of intense activity are investigated.Shallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectSeismicity patterns are revealed using frequency-magnitude distribution.Shallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectZones of low b-value are identified with the intermediate depth range.Shallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectShallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (78KB)Download full-size imageShallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in the Hindu Kush region across the Afghan-Pakistan border - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Post-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectPost-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectFully nonlinear dynamic analyses to assess the response to different earthquakesPost-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectCritical fire scenarios identified and investigated on the damaged and undamaged buildingPost-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectCollapse mechanisms of a steel frame exposed to post-earthquake fire identified for the first timePost-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectTime of local failures as well as global collapse reported and comparedPost-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectNew results show that low permanent inter-story drifts have minor effect on the reduction of the fire resistancePost-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectCurrent design procedures do not account for the concomitant or subsequent occurrence of earthquakes and fires, which has so far been justified by the low probability of occurrence of accidental actions. Nevertheless, fires are often triggered as a consequence of damage caused by the earthquake and are responsible for casualties and major additional damage to buildings and other constructions. Despite a number of research studies on the topic, it is at present unclear as to what extent the occurrence of a previous earthquake could affect the response of a structure to fire.Post-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectThe response of a moment-resistant steel frame to post-earthquake fires (PEFs) is investigated and compared with the response of the undamaged frame exposed to fire only, by means of numerical analyses performed using a commercial finite element software. The frame considered as a case study is not insulated against fire, but it is designed to comply with the service damage limitation prescribed in EN1998-1 (2004). The nonlinear seismic response to 7 different earthquakes, scaled at the same peak ground acceleration (PGA), is analyzed; then two of these earthquakes are selected for the post-earthquake fire (PEF) computations and a number of critical fire scenarios are identified, based on the vicinity of the fire to the highest permanent deformation induced by the earthquakes. The structural elements involved in each fire scenario are considered to be exposed to a standard fire and the collapse mode and time are determined by means of large deformation analysis.Post-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectThe comparison of the mode and time of the frame collapse for all the investigated scenarios shows a minor influence of the effect of the two considered earthquakes on the fire resistance of the frame. The current study shows that nonlinear geometric effects do not have a significant effect in the behavior of the building during fire, when the structure is designed to comply with the service damage limit states prescribed in EN1998-1 (2004).Post-earthquake fire resistance of steel buildings - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake risk assessment of Blida (Algeria) using GIS - ScienceDirectThe seismic vulnerability of an urban area is of a great deal for local authorities especially those facing earthquakes. So, it is important to have an efficient tool to assess the vulnerability of existing buildings. Blida is located in the north part of Algeria, an area prone to seismicity. It is classified zone III according to the Algerian Seismic Code (RPA99 version 2003). The town is among the oldest cities in the north. Build especially during the colonial period, Blida is characterized by vulnerable urban conditions with dense buildings and narrow roads. Using geographic information systems (GIS), the seismic vulnerability of Blida is assessed. First the vulnerability indexes of buildings are calculated, then making seismic scenarios. Damage rates are determined taking into account the seismotectonic aspect of the region and the vulnerability curves of structures commonly found in Blida. The rates of damage caused by the earthquake considered in the scenario highlighted the high vulnerability of Blida. These results can allow elaborating strategic countermeasure plans for the earthquake risk mitigation in the city.Rupture evolution of the 2006 Java tsunami earthquake and the possible role of splay faults - ScienceDirectRupture evolution of the 2006 Java tsunami earthquake and the possible role of splay faults - ScienceDirectThe 2006 Java earthquake produced frequency-dependent seismic radiation.Rupture evolution of the 2006 Java tsunami earthquake and the possible role of splay faults - ScienceDirectA transition in high-frequency radiation suggests a two stage rupture.Rupture evolution of the 2006 Java tsunami earthquake and the possible role of splay faults - ScienceDirectThe second-stage seismic radiation may be hosted by reactivated splay faults in the outer wedge.Rupture evolution of the 2006 Java tsunami earthquake and the possible role of splay faults - ScienceDirectRupture evolution of the 2006 Java tsunami earthquake and the possible role of splay faults - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An orthogonal Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in the spectral representation of earthquake accelerograms - ScienceDirectAn orthogonal Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in the spectral representation of earthquake accelerograms - ScienceDirectIn-depth analyses for not exactly orthogonal nature of intrinsic mode functions.An orthogonal Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in the spectral representation of earthquake accelerograms - ScienceDirectNew orthogonal technique and orthogonalization algorithms for obtaining completely orthogonal IMFs.An orthogonal Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in the spectral representation of earthquake accelerograms - ScienceDirectValidated effectiveness of the proposed technique and algorithms in practical applications.An orthogonal Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in the spectral representation of earthquake accelerograms - ScienceDirectMore reliable representation of earthquake accelerograms produced by the proposed orthogonal Hilbert spectrum.An orthogonal Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in the spectral representation of earthquake accelerograms - ScienceDirectThis paper first discusses the limitation that the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) are not orthogonal. As an improvement to the HHT method, three orthogonal techniques (the forward, backward and arbitrary sequence orthogonalization algorithms) based on the Gram-Schmidt method are then proposed to obtain the completely orthogonal IMFs. According to the orthogonal index and the energy index, the effectiveness of the proposed technique and algorithms is validated through a synthetic signal generated by the combination of three sinusoidal waves with different frequencies and the El Centro (1940, N-S) earthquake accelerogram. By taking the El Centro (1940, N-S) earthquake accelerogram as an example, the problem that whether the orthogonal IMFs satisfy the requirements of IMF is discussed, then the backward and the arbitrary sequence orthogonalization algorithms are recommended. Three historic earthquake accelerograms are analyzed by using the recommended orthogonalization algorithms combined with the Hilbert spectral analysis. The results show that the orthogonal Hilbert spectrum and the orthogonal Hilbert marginal spectrum can produce more faithful representation of earthquake accelerograms than the Hilbert spectrum and the Hilbert marginal spectrum, and they can be used to quantitatively characterize the energy distribution of earthquake accelerograms at different frequency regions.Rapid earthquake detection through GPU-Based template matching - ScienceDirectRapid earthquake detection through GPU-Based template matching - ScienceDirectWe have developed efficient GPU code for normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCC) calculations.Rapid earthquake detection through GPU-Based template matching - ScienceDirectOur current GPU code has achieved more than 800 times speedup with respect to a sequential CPU code.Rapid earthquake detection through GPU-Based template matching - ScienceDirectOur GPU-based NCC code has been applied to the template-matching algorithm (TMA) for earthquake detection.Rapid earthquake detection through GPU-Based template matching - ScienceDirectThe template-matching algorithm (TMA) has been widely adopted for improving the reliability of earthquake detection. The TMA is based on calculating the normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCC) between a collection of selected template waveforms and the continuous waveform recordings of seismic instruments. In realistic applications, the computational cost of the TMA is much higher than that of traditional techniques. In this study, we provide an analysis of the TMA and show how the GPU architecture provides an almost ideal environment for accelerating the TMA and NCC-based pattern recognition algorithms in general. So far, our best-performing GPU code has achieved a speedup factor of more than 800 with respect to a common sequential CPU code.

In this paper, two existing post-earthquake fire ignition models that are implemented in Geographic Information System (GIS) based platforms, Hazus and MAEViz/Ergo, are reviewed. The two platforms and their FFE modules have been studied for suitability in community resiliency evaluations. Based on the shortcomings in the existing literature, a new post-earthquake fire ignition model is proposed using historical FFE data and a probabilistic formulation. The procedure to create the database for the model using GIS-based tools is explained.

Strength and stiffness degradation is shown to be the primary reason for the observed damage. The present study aims to investigate the degrading behavior of irregularly built reinforced concrete structures subjected to the Tohoku ground motion sequences. Three-dimensional numerical models of three irregular reinforced concrete structures are developed. The structural characteristics of these buildings are then altered to achieve a regular case. The models contain appropriate damage features that can capture both the irregularity and material deterioration effects. The capacities of both cases are evaluated using the N2 and extended N2 procedures. The degrading models are then used for ground motion sequences measured at 23 selected stations. The results indicate that multiple earthquake effects are significant, and irregularity effects increase the dispersed damage under these excitation sequences.Earthquakes and human behavior: A sociological perspective - ScienceDirectEarthquakes and human behavior: A sociological perspective - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration - ScienceDirectAn evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration - ScienceDirectEarthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Causes of earthquake spatial distribution beneath the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc - ScienceDirectCauses of earthquake spatial distribution beneath the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc - ScienceDirectFluids from the seamounts subduction may cause the seismic segmentation along the IBM.Causes of earthquake spatial distribution beneath the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc - ScienceDirectSlab tears under the Mariana Arc affect magmatic and seismic distribution.Causes of earthquake spatial distribution beneath the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc - ScienceDirectSubduction rate is an important factor for shallow seismic events along the IBM.Causes of earthquake spatial distribution beneath the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc - ScienceDirectCauses of earthquake spatial distribution beneath the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (109KB)Download full-size imageA critical discussion on the earthquake risk mitigation of urban cultural heritage assets - ScienceDirectThis paper aims at providing a comprehensive review on disaster risk mitigation of urban cultural heritage assets located in historical centres, by providing a holistic framework on the features of such a complex system.

Following a probabilistic approach and generating several scenarios, the present study was aimed at assessing the probabilistic two-hazard risk of a structure concurrently subjected to earthquake and earthquake-induced blast. The two critical events (earthquake and blast explosion) were considered as compatible and dependent events, such that the blast would occur simultaneously with the earthquake and as the result of it. The probabilistic two-hazard risk was evaluated in two separate phases: one was characterized by near-fault earthquakes with blast; and the other phase was defined by far-fault earthquakes with blast. Comparing the probabilistic risk for the two phases revealed that the probabilistic risk of the near-field earthquake, though with a long return period, is substantially greater than that of the far-fault earthquake.Probabilistic two-hazard risk assessment of near-fault and far-fault earthquakes in a structure subjected to earthquake-induced gas explosion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fragility curves for RC frames under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectFragility curves for RC frames under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectMultiple earthquakes significantly affect fragility curves.Fragility curves for RC frames under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectMore structural vulnerability is observed as the number of stories increases.Fragility curves for RC frames under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectFragility curves are highly affected by the earthquake region.Fragility curves for RC frames under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectUsing PGA to derive fragility curves may cause unreliable results.Fragility curves for RC frames under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectThis study aims to overcome previous limitations and derive fragility curves for three RC (reinforced concrete) buildings with different number of stories under multiple earthquakes.

New material-efficient arch shapes are obtained by considering both horizontal and gravitational acceleration in the form finding process. By interpreting the obtained forms, insights into the influence of form on the earthquake resistance of the arches are presented. The form finding algorithm relies on two simplified, first-order equilibrium methods: thrust line analysis and kinematic limit state analysis, which present respectively a lower- and upper-bound approach to the analytic problem of arch stability under gravity and horizontal loading. Through a methodological application of a series of geometric manipulations of the thrust line, shapes are obtained that can resist the design acceleration by guaranteeing a compression-only load path. Forms are obtained for horizontal accelerations of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.45g, as well as for arches of different rise-to-span ratios (1/2, 1/4 and 1/8). The obtained shapes require up to 65% less material than circular arches with constant thickness that are designed to withstand the same horizontal acceleration and self-weight, regardless of acceleration magnitude. The findings of this research will thus allow more material-efficient design of masonry arches in seismic areas.Form-finding algorithm for masonry arches subjected to in-plane earthquake loading - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Preliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectPreliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectThe Manu earthquake (Tripura, India) of January 3, 2017 (MW 5.6) was an intraslab event in the underlying Indian plate.Preliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectThe earthquake, despite its relatively deeper depth and low magnitude, caused soil liquefaction.Preliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectSoil liquefaction during future large earthquakes is a major threat in the Tripura fold belt and Bengal basin regions.Preliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectPreliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (477KB)Download full-size imagePreliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, MW 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Underwater shaking table tests on bridge pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action - ScienceDirectUnderwater shaking table tests on bridge pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action - ScienceDirectIn order to investigate the dynamic response of the pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action, a series of 50:1 scale underwater shaking table tests on a large-scale bridge pier was conducted using the Earthquake, Wave and Current Joint Simulation System.Underwater shaking table tests on bridge pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action - ScienceDirectFour main tests were carried out under various water levels, including white noise tests, independent earthquake tests, independent wave-current tests and combined earthquake and wave-current tests.Underwater shaking table tests on bridge pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action - ScienceDirectThe effect of wave-current action on the seismic responses of the pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action was explored, and the distribution law of hydrodynamic pressure along the height of the pier under various load conditions was summarized.Underwater shaking table tests on bridge pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action - ScienceDirectThe cross-sea bridges that located in earthquake-prone areas have the potential to be subjected to earthquake and wave-current action simultaneously during their construction and service period. In order to investigate the dynamic response of the pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action, a series of model tests of scale 50:1 was carried out using the Earthquake, Wave and Current Joint Simulation System. Four main tests were conducted under various water levels, including white noise tests, independent earthquake tests, independent wave-current tests and combined earthquake and wave-current tests. The effect of wave-current action on the seismic responses of the pier and the distribution law of hydrodynamic pressure along the height of the pier under various load conditions are determined. The test results show that the existence of water decreases the natural frequencies of the pier. The peak dynamic responses of the pier in water under independent earthquake action are mostly larger than those without water. When the earthquake excitation is moderate and the wave-current action is relatively severe, the dynamic responses of the pier under independent wave-current action are comparable to those under independent earthquake action, and the effect of wave-current action on the seismic responses of the pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action is great and can not be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the combined action of earthquake and wave-current in bridge design under this circumstance, and the effect of long-period earthquake on bridges should be considered.Underwater shaking table tests on bridge pier under combined earthquake and wave-current action - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ripple effects of the 2011 Japan earthquake on international stock markets - ScienceDirectRipple effects of the 2011 Japan earthquake on international stock markets - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (220KB)Download full-size imageRipple effects of the 2011 Japan earthquake on international stock markets - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Comparison of two large earthquakes in China: The Ms 6.6 Yunnan Jinggu Earthquake and the Ms 6.5 Yunnan Ludian Earthquake in 2014 - ScienceDirectComparison of two large earthquakes in China: The Ms 6.6 Yunnan Jinggu Earthquake and the Ms 6.5 Yunnan Ludian Earthquake in 2014 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Developing a holistic model for earthquake risk assessment and disaster management interventions in urban fabrics - ScienceDirectThe main scope of this study is to develop a holistic model for assessing earthquake risk and determining priorities for risk reduction and management in urban fabrics. The developed model estimates the earthquake risk at each urban zone based on hazard, vulnerability and response capacity. Additionally, a new indicator called "Integrated Earthquake Safety Index, IESI" is introduced to address the safety level of urban fabrics in relation to earthquakes and assess the impacts of applicable interventions on risk. The proposed model is then applied in two districts of Tehran, having different physical and socio-economic characteristics, to evaluate the safety level for earthquakes. For this purpose, the contributing elements in hazard, vulnerability and response capacity have been assessed based on local conditions and the IESI is determined for each urban zone. In addition, the applicability of the model to address potential improvement measures has also been evaluated. The results show that IESI can be improved by different short to long-term interventions; while amongst short-term measures, promoting community based disaster management activities as well as developing search and rescue bases may increase safety level significantly in the selected districts.Developing a holistic model for earthquake risk assessment and disaster management interventions in urban fabrics - ScienceDirectThe proposed model is applicable for all seismic prone urban fabrics, while its parameters should be determined based on local conditions. Furthermore, the model can be utilized by disaster management authorities as well as city planners to prioritize short to long-term earthquake risk reduction and management interventions and to allocate available resources more effectively in order to reduce earthquake damage and casualties.Time-series analysis of earthquake sequences by means of information recognizer - ScienceDirectTime-series analysis of earthquake sequences by means of information recognizer - ScienceDirectA new method to study seismic activity based on information theory is presented.Time-series analysis of earthquake sequences by means of information recognizer - ScienceDirectThe time series of seismic events are studied by means of an information recognizer.Time-series analysis of earthquake sequences by means of information recognizer - ScienceDirectTime-series analysis of earthquake sequences by means of information recognizer - ScienceDirectThree seismic sequences of several thousand earthquakes each are analyzed by means of a tunable information recognizer known as wlzip. These sequences are different both in the geographical coverage and the time span, including earthquakes of magnitude larger than 8.0. The main variable under scrutiny here is the time interval between consecutive events. Two parameters (mutability and interval dilation) are defined for each sequence, which relate to the information contained in it. In this way it is possible to characterize different regimes in the seismic activity. For instance, mutability increases before large earthquakes and decreases sharply immediately after each of these events. On the other hand, interval dilation reaches a clear maximum several months before major earthquakes, while it decreases to its lowest possible value after such earthquakes during the aftershock regime. Extensions of the application of this new method to other problems in seismicity are mentioned.Time-series analysis of earthquake sequences by means of information recognizer - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of prior experience in informing and motivating earthquake preparedness - ScienceDirectMotivating household preparedness for earthquakes can be difficult, especially given the infrequent and varying nature of major events. Past research has shown that people's experiences contribute to their beliefs about whether, and how, they should prepare for earthquakes. Direct experience of a disaster can be a strong motivator of preparedness; however, most people will not directly experience a large damaging earthquake in their lifetimes. They instead need to rely on experience of small earthquakes, experience of different disasters, adverse life experiences (e.g. accidents), or vicarious experience. This paper explores the influence of such experiences on earthquake preparedness. The research found that experience has seven different influences on the preparedness process including: prompting thinking and talking; raising awareness and knowledge; helping individuals understand the consequences of a disaster; developing beliefs; developing preparedness; influencing emotions and feelings; and prompting community interaction on disaster issues.Preparing for the new normal: Students and earthquake hazard adjustments in Oklahoma - ScienceDirectSince 2010, Oklahoma has seen a major increase in earthquakes, with an average of one-to-two M3.0 earthquakes occurring per day in 2015. We know little, however, about resident's risk perceptions regarding this new hazard. This study examines how individual risk perceptions, hazard experience, hazard salience, and other factors influence individual hazard adjustments efforts. We find that risk perceptions are related to an individual's intention to adopt hazard adjustments, but not the actual adoption of adjustments. Hazard salience is related to actual adoption of hazard adjustments, as are several demographic variables. We also find that individuals are more likely to make hazard adjustments for earthquakes if they believe those adjustments will also protect them from other hazards, such as high wind events. This leads us to make some practical suggestions for emergency managers regarding educating citizens about the actual risks associated with earthquakes and the value of individual mitigation efforts.Preparing for the new normal: Students and earthquake hazard adjustments in Oklahoma - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Catastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectCatastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectWe review the largest and most extensively dated archive of earthquake-triggered valley fills in the Lesser Himalayas.Catastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectRadiocarbon dates indicate at least three pulses of catastrophic sedimentation following great medieval Himalayan earthquakes.Catastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectSedimentological features and geochemical analysis independently identify these aggradation events.Catastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectCatastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectCatastrophic valley fills record large Himalayan earthquakes, Pokhara, Nepal - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A smart phone-based system for post-earthquake investigations of building damage - ScienceDirectCurrent post-earthquake investigations of building damage are mainly conducted manually, making the collection and management of the investigation data inefficient. To overcome this shortcoming, a professional system for post-earthquake investigations of building damage is proposed herein using smart phones. This system adopts a framework which uses smart phones for distributed data collection and a web browser for centralized data management. A building-oriented database is designed to satisfy the requirements of data organization in the investigations. In addition, a data exchange mechanism between smart phones and the web server is created, demonstrating a satisfactory level of fault-tolerance for various use cases of the system. Further, an algorithm of reverse address retrieval of photos based on multi-threads is designed to conveniently index photos by their addresses. The proposed system is used in a virtual investigation of Tsinghua University campus and a practical investigation of the Tibet area during the 2015 Nepal earthquake. These case studies demonstrate that the proposed system offers an intelligentized, efficient and networked tool for post-earthquake investigations of building damage.The impact of information sources on earthquake preparedness - ScienceDirectThe impact of information sources on earthquake preparedness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The earthquakes network: Retrieving the empirical seismological laws - ScienceDirect

ScienceDirectThe study presents a new method of earthquake prediction.Study of particles in the ascending gas of ruptures caused by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectAscending gas is a global phenomenon. It can move upwards along faults or fissures from the interior of the Earth to the surface of the Earth. Seismically active regions near continental plate boundaries are active regions of ascending gas. Based on the results of previous research, abnormal concentrations of SO2, CO2, Rn, He, H2, O2, Ar, N2, and CH4 in ascending gas may be applied to earthquake prediction. In our study, particles carried by ascending gas in ruptures caused by the Wenchuan earthquake have been discovered using a transmission electron microscope. It can be seen that there are far more particles in the ascending gas of ruptures caused by the 2008 earthquake than there are in the ascending gas of the non-seismic Fengguanshan fault or the ascending gas of the soil in Wufeng Town of Jintang County or Yuhe Village of Pengshan County (which represent background areas). The abnormal characteristics of the particles carried by the ascending gas of ruptures also include Cu-, Hg-, and Os-enriched particles. The typical elemental associations are Fe-Mn-Ni-Cr and Pb-Cr. SiO2 particles contain abnormally high contents of impure elements in the form of particles that have been encapsulated by SiO2. This is the first study to report the presence of particles carried by ascending gas in earthquake ruptures. This study represents a new method of earthquake prediction. These particles can provide us with abundant and direct information about earthquake activity, which can be applied to earthquake prediction. Characteristics of the particles in the ascending gas, combined with the concentrations of Hg, SO2, CO2, Rn, He, H2, O2, Ar, N2, and CH4, can be used to develop a more efficient method of earthquake prediction.Study of particles in the ascending gas of ruptures caused by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-induced settlement of a clay layer - ScienceDirectEarthquake-induced settlement of a clay layer - ScienceDirectEffect of soil plasticity on cyclic shear-induced pore water pressure and settlement.Earthquake-induced settlement of a clay layer - ScienceDirectEstimate cyclic shear-induced pore water pressure and settlement of various clays.Earthquake-induced settlement of a clay layer - ScienceDirectTransform the irregular strain-time histories into the equivalent uniform ones.Earthquake-induced settlement of a clay layer - ScienceDirectPrediction of the earthquake-induced settlement of clay layer.Earthquake-induced settlement of a clay layer - ScienceDirectA model for pore water pressure accumulation and settlement of saturated clay layer induced by uniform and irregular cyclic shear strains was developed by concerning the direction of cyclic shear strain. To apply this model to any kinds of clay, the effects of Atterberg's limits of cohesive clay on the cyclic shear-induced pore water pressure and the settlement were observed by using the strain-controlled cyclic simple shear test apparatus which can control the cyclic shear direction. In conclusion, the effects of Atterberg's limits of clay on the cyclic shear-induced pore water pressure accumulation and settlement were clarified by using the cumulative shear strain. Based on the experimental results, estimation methods for the pore water pressure accumulation and post-cyclic settlement of clay with a wide range of Atterberg's limits were developed. Furthermore, to apply the proposed methods to the earthquake-induced ground motions, a transformation procedure of irregular cyclic shears to the equivalent uniform ones including the effect of cyclic shear direction was developed and the practical applicability was confirmed.Recurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectRecurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectThe earthquakes-stress buildup and release associated to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake are simulated.Recurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectRecurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectSensitivities relying on model dependent parameters are discussed.Recurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectIt provides a method of geodynamic modelling to estimate recurrence interval of large earthquakes.Recurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectRecurrence interval of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake inferred from geodynamic modelling stress buildup and release - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Demonstration of pb-PSHA with Ras-Elhekma earthquake, Egypt - ScienceDirectDemonstration of pb-PSHA with Ras-Elhekma earthquake, Egypt - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics.Post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic growth among the adult survivors of the Lushan earthquake: Selecting resilience as the moderator - ScienceDirectOn 20 April 2013, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, the second worst natural disaster after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, struck Ya'an, Sichuan, China. This research studies the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) among 2001 adult survivors who experienced the 2013 Lushan earthquake. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the severely affected area of Sichuan. A total of 2300 adult residents participated in the random sampling questionnaire survey eight months after the earthquake, and the sample population was 2001. PTSD was found to be negatively correlated with the survivors' PTG and resilience was positively related to PTG, while the negative effects of PTSD on PTG are weakened by the moderating role of resilience. The results indicate that more attention needs to be paid to strengthening the survivors' resilience as this can reduce their PTSD levels and improve their PTG. This study could support psychological relief workers helping survivors who experienced the earthquake and administrators who encounter similar situations in other countries or regions.History of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectHistory of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectAges of ancient Kanto Earthquakes (KE) are constrained for the first time.History of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectHistory of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectEphemeral inter-tidal deposits seem to retain a history of uplift.History of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectAn unknown event before the 9th century caused permanent uplift of the region.History of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectHistory of ancient megathrust earthquakes beneath metropolitan Tokyo inferred from coastal lowland deposits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-related injuries among survivors: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of the literature - ScienceDirectEarthquakes cause widespread casualties and significant loss of assets worldwide, and the injuries caused by earthquakes are always complex and of various patterns. In order to provide robust disaster preparedness and an optimized response, the current study tried to identify and describe the exact type and distribution of earthquake injuries of victims who were transferred to hospitals around the world. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database) were used to search for studies about earthquake-related injuries from China as well as from other countries that were published over the past 50 years. 74 research articles were included in our study, with 37 articles in Chinese and 37 in English. In this analysis, fractures, soft tissue and crush injuries were the three most common and most reported injury types. Extremities and the head/neck were the most common and mentioned injury locations. Being struck by an object was the major cause of earthquake-associated morbidity. In high-magnitude earthquakes compared to those in low-magnitude earthquakes we observed a lower percent of soft tissue injury and a higher percent of nerve injury. Patients from countries with high levels of economic development suffered a higher percent of fracture and multiple injuries, but a lower percent of nerve and spine injury compared to those of patients from countries with low levels of economic development. Earthquakes will continue to strike, and healthcare responders must be prepared to overcome the resulting situations by anticipating consequences and planning accordingly.Earthquake-related injuries among survivors: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of the literature - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-related injuries among survivors: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of the literature - ScienceDirectThe first three authors contributed equally to this paper.Matched-filter detection of the missing pre-mainshock events and aftershocks in the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectMatched-filter detection of the missing pre-mainshock events and aftershocks in the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Observational signatures of unusual outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) as precursory effects of May 2015 Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectPre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectPre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe model pre-disaster investment of Chinese railway system under earthquakes.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe propose a self-adaptive genetic algorithm to solve the model.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe compare optimum investment with those from topology-based strategies.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectIncreasing budget from 1 million to 9 million may reduce service loss by 18.7%Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectThis study proposes a framework to determine the investment plan to strengthen a railway system which is subject to earthquake hazard. The proposed framework includes four parts: (1) Construct a two-layer (physical layer and service layer) railway network representation; (2) Generate earthquake scenarios based on historical earthquake data; (3) Formulate an investment optimization model to minimize the expected railway system service loss subjected to an investment budget constraint, where the service loss is quantified based on the affected train flow; (4) Solve the optimization model by using Genetic Algorithm. Taking the Chinese railway system (CRS) as an example, the proposed framework has been applied and the results show that the solution of the proposed framework is more responsive to the earthquake impact on railway system compared to topology-based methods. Note that the proposed framework can also be extended to identify pre-disaster investment plans for other transportation systems under natural disasters.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectInvestigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectVariations in atmospheric parameters occur prior to occurrence of earthquake.Investigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectMechanism of seismic anomalies before an earthquake is discussed.Investigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectPrecursor anomalies appear over regional level and over a long time.Investigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe earthquake precursors' anomalies at diverse elevation ranges over the seismogenic region and prior to the seismic events are perceived using Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) techniques and reanalysis datasets. In the current research, seismic precursors are obtained by analyzing anomalies in Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), Air Temperature (AT), and Relative Humidity (RH) before the two strong Mw>7 earthquakes in Pakistan occurred on 8th October 2005 in Azad Jammu Kashmir with Mw 7.6, and 24th September 2013 in Awaran, Balochistan with Mw 7.7. Multi-parameter data were computed based on multi-year background data for anomalies computation. Results indicate significant transient variations in observed parameters before the main event. Detailed analysis suggests presence of pre-seismic activities one to three weeks prior to the main earthquake event that vanishes after the event. These anomalies are due to increase in temperature after release of gases and physical and chemical interactions on earth surface before the earthquake. The parameter variations behavior for both Kashmir and Awaran earthquake events are similar to other earthquakes in different regions of the world. This study suggests that energy release is not concentrated to a single fault but instead is released along the fault zone. The influence of earthquake events on lightning were also investigated and it was concluded that there is a significant atmospheric lightning activity after the earthquake suggesting a strong possibility for an earthquake induced thunderstorm. This study is valuable for identifying earthquake precursors especially in earthquake prone areas.Investigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectQuantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectDynamic modeling of lithospheric blocks and faults is examined.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectSimulated large events in several seismic hazard-prone regions are reviewed.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectHazard assessment utilizes recorded, historical, and simulated earthquakes.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectUnderstanding of lithosphere dynamics, tectonic stress localization, earthquake occurrences, and seismic hazards has significantly advanced during the last decades. Meanwhile, despite the major advancements in geophysical sciences, yet we do not see a decline in earthquake disaster impacts and losses. Although earthquake disasters are mainly associated with significant vulnerability of society, comprehensive seismic hazards assessments and earthquake forecasting could contribute to preventive measures aimed to reduce impacts of earthquakes. Modeling of lithosphere dynamics and earthquake simulations coupled with a seismic hazard analysis can provide a better assessment of potential ground shaking due to earthquakes. Here we present a block-and-fault dynamics (BAFD) model, which simulates earthquakes due to lithosphere dynamics and allows for studying the influence of fault network properties and regional movements on seismic patterns. The model's performance is analyzed in terms of reproduction of basic features of the observed seismicity such as the frequency-magnitude relationship, clustering of earthquakes, occurrences of large events, fault slip rates, and earthquake mechanisms. Several studies related to the application of the BAFD model to the following earthquake-prone regions are reviewed: the southeastern Carpathians, Caucasus, the western India, Tibet-Himalaya, and the Sunda Arc. We examine then a new approach to seismic hazard analysis, which is based on instrumentally recorded, historical and BAFD-simulated earthquakes, and analyze how earthquake modeling can assist in hazard assessment. Finally, we discuss perspectives in modeling of earthquake occurrences and improvements in hazard assessment.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectAfterslip is dominantly distributed downdip of the mainshock rupture areas.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectThe Gorkha earthquake only unzipped the lower edge of the Main Himalayan Thrust.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (428KB)Download full-size imagePostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recurrence of strong seismic events in the area of the 2011-2012 Tuva earthquakes according to paleoseismological data - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the results of paleoseismological studies in the epicentral area of the Tuva earthquake of 2011 (M = 6.7) and 2012 (M = 6.8). Their seismotectonic position and seismic history over the last millennia has been studied. The results are of great importance because these earthquakes are the strongest in the history of seismological observations in Tuva and are thus the first well-studied strong earthquakes in this region. The data show that relatively weak events similar to the 2011-2012 Tuva earthquakes recurred every 300-500 years in the past millennium, while catastrophic earthquakes with M = 7.0-7.2 and higher occur approximately every thousand years.Recurrence of strong seismic events in the area of the 2011-2012 Tuva earthquakes according to paleoseismological data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant - ScienceDirectEffect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant - ScienceDirectFirst study of earthquake impact on antenatal mental health in a low-income country.Effect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant - ScienceDirectHigh prevalence of antenatal CMD symptoms among women who experienced the 2015 Nepal Earthquake during pregnancy.Effect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant - ScienceDirectIPV was the biggest risk factor for antenatal CMD symptoms among pregnant women after the 2015 Nepal Earthquake.Effect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant - ScienceDirectExperiencing partners as trustworthy, and affectionate protected pregnancy mental health after the 2015 Nepal Earthquake.Effect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant - ScienceDirectAntenatal mental health problems are of concern globally not only because of the burden and limits to participation experienced by women but also because of risks for foetal neurocognitive development and adverse birth outcomes.

Based on the results of previous research, abnormal concentrations of SO2, CO2, Rn, He, H2, O2, Ar, N2, and CH4 in ascending gas may be applied to earthquake prediction. In our study, particles carried by ascending gas in ruptures caused by the Wenchuan earthquake have been discovered using a transmission electron microscope. It can be seen that there are far more particles in the ascending gas of ruptures caused by the 2008 earthquake than there are in the ascending gas of the non-seismic Fengguanshan fault or the ascending gas of the soil in Wufeng Town of Jintang County or Yuhe Village of Pengshan County (which represent background areas). The abnormal characteristics of the particles carried by the ascending gas of ruptures also include Cu-, Hg-, and Os-enriched particles. The typical elemental associations are Fe-Mn-Ni-Cr and Pb-Cr. SiO2 particles contain abnormally high contents of impure elements in the form of particles that have been encapsulated by SiO2. This is the first study to report the presence of particles carried by ascending gas in earthquake ruptures. This study represents a new method of earthquake prediction. These particles can provide us with abundant and direct information about earthquake activity, which can be applied to earthquake prediction. Characteristics of the particles in the ascending gas, combined with the concentrations of Hg, SO2, CO2, Rn, He, H2, O2, Ar, N2, and CH4, can be used to develop a more efficient method of earthquake prediction.Study of particles in the ascending gas of ruptures caused by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.One sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectOne sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectOne sliding PCA method is put forward to detect pre-earthquake ionospheric anomaly.One sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe effect of sliding window on the background TEC is analyzed.One sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe 27-day sliding window is optimally selected in the study.One sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe TEC anomaly before four great earthquakes are detected with this new method.One sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectOne sliding PCA method to detect ionospheric anomalies before strong Earthquakes: Cases study of Qinghai, Honshu, Hotan and Nepal earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Automatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectAutomatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectWe propose a set of high-precision algorithms to detect seismic phase for the EEW.Automatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectMethod validity is verified by the events occurred in China typical seismic zones.Automatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectThe observed acceleration records in Wenchuan earthquake are performed.Automatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectThe detection rate and picking accuracy can fulfil the requirement of the EEW.Automatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectAutomatic event detection and picking of P, S seismic phases for earthquake early warning and application for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-related injuries among survivors: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of the literature - ScienceDirectEarthquakes cause widespread casualties and significant loss of assets worldwide, and the injuries caused by earthquakes are always complex and of various patterns. In order to provide robust disaster preparedness and an optimized response, the current study tried to identify and describe the exact type and distribution of earthquake injuries of victims who were transferred to hospitals around the world. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database) were used to search for studies about earthquake-related injuries from China as well as from other countries that were published over the past 50 years. 74 research articles were included in our study, with 37 articles in Chinese and 37 in English. In this analysis, fractures, soft tissue and crush injuries were the three most common and most reported injury types. Extremities and the head/neck were the most common and mentioned injury locations. Being struck by an object was the major cause of earthquake-associated morbidity. In high-magnitude earthquakes compared to those in low-magnitude earthquakes we observed a lower percent of soft tissue injury and a higher percent of nerve injury. Patients from countries with high levels of economic development suffered a higher percent of fracture and multiple injuries, but a lower percent of nerve and spine injury compared to those of patients from countries with low levels of economic development. Earthquakes will continue to strike, and healthcare responders must be prepared to overcome the resulting situations by anticipating consequences and planning accordingly.Earthquake-related injuries among survivors: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of the literature - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-related injuries among survivors: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of the literature - ScienceDirectThe first three authors contributed equally to this paper.Post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic growth among the adult survivors of the Lushan earthquake: Selecting resilience as the moderator - ScienceDirectOn 20 April 2013, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, the second worst natural disaster after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, struck Ya'an, Sichuan, China. This research studies the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) among 2001 adult survivors who experienced the 2013 Lushan earthquake. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the severely affected area of Sichuan. A total of 2300 adult residents participated in the random sampling questionnaire survey eight months after the earthquake, and the sample population was 2001. PTSD was found to be negatively correlated with the survivors' PTG and resilience was positively related to PTG, while the negative effects of PTSD on PTG are weakened by the moderating role of resilience. The results indicate that more attention needs to be paid to strengthening the survivors' resilience as this can reduce their PTSD levels and improve their PTG. This study could support psychological relief workers helping survivors who experienced the earthquake and administrators who encounter similar situations in other countries or regions.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectOverestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectWe study the site-effects related to stratified archeological mounds.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectMeasured Vs profile on a typical mound reveals a shallow low velocity layer.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectMound structure has the potential to significantly amplify seismic ground motions.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectMagnitude evaluation of historical earthquakes is potentially overestimated.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectHistorical parts of modern cities are subject to higher seismic hazard.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectOverestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectIn this study we measured the subsurface shear-wave velocity (Vs) profile on top of a typical mound structure as well as the Vs profile of the bedrock on which the mound was accumulated. The results suggest that the mound structure is likely to amplify seismic ground motions.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectThese results imply that intensity-based magnitude evaluation of Near East historical earthquakes that are based on reported damage from cities built on archeological mounds, might be biased and could lead to over-estimations of past earthquake magnitudes. Furthermore, many old residential quarters of modern Near Eastern cities are commonly founded on such mounds and might be exposed to a higher seismic hazard than nearby modern neighborhoods, thus requiring special attention in seismic hazard mitigation programs and seismic design.Overestimation of historical earthquake magnitudes in the Near East due to common site effects - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectPre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe model pre-disaster investment of Chinese railway system under earthquakes.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe propose a self-adaptive genetic algorithm to solve the model.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe compare optimum investment with those from topology-based strategies.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectIncreasing budget from 1 million to 9 million may reduce service loss by 18.7%Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectThis study proposes a framework to determine the investment plan to strengthen a railway system which is subject to earthquake hazard. The proposed framework includes four parts: (1) Construct a two-layer (physical layer and service layer) railway network representation; (2) Generate earthquake scenarios based on historical earthquake data; (3) Formulate an investment optimization model to minimize the expected railway system service loss subjected to an investment budget constraint, where the service loss is quantified based on the affected train flow; (4) Solve the optimization model by using Genetic Algorithm. Taking the Chinese railway system (CRS) as an example, the proposed framework has been applied and the results show that the solution of the proposed framework is more responsive to the earthquake impact on railway system compared to topology-based methods. Note that the proposed framework can also be extended to identify pre-disaster investment plans for other transportation systems under natural disasters.Pre-disaster investment decisions for strengthening the Chinese railway system under earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recurrence of strong seismic events in the area of the 2011-2012 Tuva earthquakes according to paleoseismological data - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the results of paleoseismological studies in the epicentral area of the Tuva earthquake of 2011 (M = 6.7) and 2012 (M = 6.8). Their seismotectonic position and seismic history over the last millennia has been studied. The results are of great importance because these earthquakes are the strongest in the history of seismological observations in Tuva and are thus the first well-studied strong earthquakes in this region. The data show that relatively weak events similar to the 2011-2012 Tuva earthquakes recurred every 300-500 years in the past millennium, while catastrophic earthquakes with M = 7.0-7.2 and higher occur approximately every thousand years.Recurrence of strong seismic events in the area of the 2011-2012 Tuva earthquakes according to paleoseismological data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectQuantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectDynamic modeling of lithospheric blocks and faults is examined.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectSimulated large events in several seismic hazard-prone regions are reviewed.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectHazard assessment utilizes recorded, historical, and simulated earthquakes.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectUnderstanding of lithosphere dynamics, tectonic stress localization, earthquake occurrences, and seismic hazards has significantly advanced during the last decades. Meanwhile, despite the major advancements in geophysical sciences, yet we do not see a decline in earthquake disaster impacts and losses. Although earthquake disasters are mainly associated with significant vulnerability of society, comprehensive seismic hazards assessments and earthquake forecasting could contribute to preventive measures aimed to reduce impacts of earthquakes. Modeling of lithosphere dynamics and earthquake simulations coupled with a seismic hazard analysis can provide a better assessment of potential ground shaking due to earthquakes. Here we present a block-and-fault dynamics (BAFD) model, which simulates earthquakes due to lithosphere dynamics and allows for studying the influence of fault network properties and regional movements on seismic patterns. The model's performance is analyzed in terms of reproduction of basic features of the observed seismicity such as the frequency-magnitude relationship, clustering of earthquakes, occurrences of large events, fault slip rates, and earthquake mechanisms. Several studies related to the application of the BAFD model to the following earthquake-prone regions are reviewed: the southeastern Carpathians, Caucasus, the western India, Tibet-Himalaya, and the Sunda Arc. We examine then a new approach to seismic hazard analysis, which is based on instrumentally recorded, historical and BAFD-simulated earthquakes, and analyze how earthquake modeling can assist in hazard assessment. Finally, we discuss perspectives in modeling of earthquake occurrences and improvements in hazard assessment.Quantitative modeling of the lithosphere dynamics, earthquakes and seismic hazard - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquakes drive focused denudation along a tectonically active mountain front - ScienceDirectEarthquakes drive focused denudation along a tectonically active mountain front - ScienceDirectSeismic processes control denudation after the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake.Earthquakes drive focused denudation along a tectonically active mountain front - ScienceDirectEarthquakes drive focused denudation along a tectonically active mountain front - ScienceDirectEarthquakes drive focused denudation along a tectonically active mountain front - ScienceDirectEarthquakes drive focused denudation along a tectonically active mountain front - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Matched-filter detection of the missing pre-mainshock events and aftershocks in the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectMatched-filter detection of the missing pre-mainshock events and aftershocks in the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic performance of a building affected by moderate liquefaction during the Christchurch earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic performance of a building affected by moderate liquefaction during the Christchurch earthquake - ScienceDirectA detailed case history of the seismic performance of a shallow-founded structure built on a site largely composed of medium dense sands and gravels is presented.Seismic performance of a building affected by moderate liquefaction during the Christchurch earthquake - ScienceDirectA layer of liquefiable soils was found in an area shown on historic maps as a stream, which was likely buried during city development.

In the current research, seismic precursors are obtained by analyzing anomalies in Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), Air Temperature (AT), and Relative Humidity (RH) before the two strong Mw>7 earthquakes in Pakistan occurred on 8th October 2005 in Azad Jammu Kashmir with Mw 7.6, and 24th September 2013 in Awaran, Balochistan with Mw 7.7. Multi-parameter data were computed based on multi-year background data for anomalies computation. Results indicate significant transient variations in observed parameters before the main event. Detailed analysis suggests presence of pre-seismic activities one to three weeks prior to the main earthquake event that vanishes after the event. These anomalies are due to increase in temperature after release of gases and physical and chemical interactions on earth surface before the earthquake. The parameter variations behavior for both Kashmir and Awaran earthquake events are similar to other earthquakes in different regions of the world. This study suggests that energy release is not concentrated to a single fault but instead is released along the fault zone. The influence of earthquake events on lightning were also investigated and it was concluded that there is a significant atmospheric lightning activity after the earthquake suggesting a strong possibility for an earthquake induced thunderstorm. This study is valuable for identifying earthquake precursors especially in earthquake prone areas.Investigation of atmospheric anomalies associated with Kashmir and Awaran Earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake prediction in California using regression algorithms and cloud-based big data infrastructure - ScienceDirectEarthquake prediction in California using regression algorithms and cloud-based big data infrastructure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectAfterslip is dominantly distributed downdip of the mainshock rupture areas.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectThe Gorkha earthquake only unzipped the lower edge of the Main Himalayan Thrust.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (428KB)Download full-size imagePostseismic deformation associated with the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal: investigating ongoing afterslip and constraining crustal rheology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects on Chilean Vertical Reference Frame due to the Maule Earthquake co-seismic and post-seismic effects - ScienceDirectEffects on Chilean Vertical Reference Frame due to the Maule Earthquake co-seismic and post-seismic effects - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectEffect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectDamages from previous events are more important in the irregular building.Effect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectResponse of the irregular building is highly affected by earthquake direction.Effect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectAftershock polarity can highly change the demands in the irregular building.Effect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectThe direction of aftershock has a very slight effect on the regular building.Effect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectEffect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectEffect of different aspects of multiple earthquakes on the nonlinear behavior of RC structures - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Segmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectSegmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectThe rupture of Gorkha 2015 earthquake is bounded by structural barriers.Segmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectStructural lineaments and ramp/flat geometry of the Himalayan thrust system control its segmentation.Segmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectStable barriers define five barrier-type earthquake families in Central Himalaya.Segmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectVarious rupture histories are expected for each individual earthquake.Segmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectSegmentation of the Himalayan megathrust around the Gorkha earthquake (25 April 2015) in Nepal - ScienceDirectThis combined structural approach and earthquake study allows us to propose that the MHT in the central/eastern Himalaya is segmented by stable barriers that define barrier-type earthquake families.

This paper compares and analyzes the differences of the two modes empirically on the basis of the evaluations of the earthquake victims. Based on the framework outlined in the Tsunami Recovery Status Report issued by United Nations and the Overall Plan for Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction issued by China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, an evaluation indicator system is proposed, which consists of six categories of evaluation indicators, including livelihoods, urban housing, infrastructure, public services, eco-environment and spiritual homeland. The system is used to evaluate the degree of satisfaction with post-earthquake reconstruction from the perspective of measured residential satisfaction. This paper then presents the results of case analyses of two typical quake-hit regions in China's 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Wenchuan and Beichuan, which adopted reallocated reconstruction and in-situ reconstruction modes respectively for post-earthquake reconstruction. The analyses are conducted on the basis of survey data from 300 questionnaires and data from statistical yearbooks. The results show that (1) it is statistically significant that the reallocated reconstruction mode brings the higher total degree of satisfaction with post-earthquake reconstruction than the in-situ reconstruction does, and (2) the in-situ reconstruction mode only generates relatively better results than reallocated reconstruction does in terms of the spiritual homeland-related indicators, including neighbor relationship, communication with relative, family harmony, and health of families. The critical indicators affecting the total degree of satisfaction with post-earthquake reconstruction are identified as well, which are preservation and development of culture, governmental service and housing.Comparison study on two post-earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction modes in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Use of wavelets techniques to discriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes - ScienceDirectUse of wavelets techniques to discriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes - ScienceDirectImprove the analysis and understanding of parameters associated to critical events.Use of wavelets techniques to discriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes - ScienceDirectDiscriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes.Use of wavelets techniques to discriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes - ScienceDirectModel and describe some of the key distributional features of typical geophysical time series.Use of wavelets techniques to discriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes - ScienceDirectUse of wavelets techniques to discriminate between explosions and natural earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF A RECOVERY PROCESS AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE: THE CASE OF L'AQUILA, ITALY - ScienceDirectMEASURING THE PROGRESS OF A RECOVERY PROCESS AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE: THE CASE OF L'AQUILA, ITALY - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF A RECOVERY PROCESS AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE: THE CASE OF L'AQUILA, ITALY - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 02 4921 5771/+39 0 38 25169898.MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF A RECOVERY PROCESS AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE: THE CASE OF L'AQUILA, ITALY - ScienceDirectTel.: +43 0 662/8044 7525; Mobile: +43 0 6648251301.Nested Newmark model to calculate the post-earthquake profile of slopes - ScienceDirectNested Newmark model to calculate the post-earthquake profile of slopes - ScienceDirectThe NNM procedure demonstrates utility for assessing a slope profile subject to horizontal or vertical changes after seismic loading.Nested Newmark model to calculate the post-earthquake profile of slopes - ScienceDirectThis procedure captures regions of distributed shear within a slope and enables a geometric constraint of toe movement, as one would practically expect in realistic slope failures. The resulting profiles often demonstrate bulging and subsidence at the slope toe and crest, respectively.Nested Newmark model to calculate the post-earthquake profile of slopes - ScienceDirectThe NNM framework is versatile and can be modified to incorporate a range of failure mechanisms outside of translational failures.Nested Newmark model to calculate the post-earthquake profile of slopes - ScienceDirectThe Newmark sliding block approach is a common means of evaluating permanent displacements of slopes undergoing seismic loading. However, the conventional Newmark approach omits the presence of multiple shear zones or regions of dispersed shear movement. The occurrence of these shear movements within slopes can often materialize with added vertical and lateral movements above the basal failure surface typically considered in the conventional Newmark approach. This study modifies the conventional Newmark sliding block approach by discretizing a given slope into a series of nested, critical failure wedges, each with an associated yield acceleration, termed a Nested Newmark Model (NNM). Use of the NNM enables assessment of a post-earthquake slope profile within a limit equilibrium framework based on the integration of relative displacements from the toe to the crest. The results demonstrate a different response than conventional Newmark approaches. The model outputs can account for the restriction of toe movements as well as heaving and slumping behavior of the slope face and crest, respectively. Larger seismic excitation resulted in further destabilization of nested wedges near the crest. The presented approach establishes a framework that can be extended to any type of failure geometry or series of failures, including rotational geometry. These results are compared to a numerical model, which exhibit similar behavior. This framework is conceptual, but builds upon the well-accepted Newmark sliding block approach to provide an alternative means of assessing post-earthquake slope movements.Nested Newmark model to calculate the post-earthquake profile of slopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectEffect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectGR law is discussed in the maximum entropy principle perspective.Effect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectSampling with constraints defines stochastic seismicity model.Effect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectEffect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectRelation between b-value and rupture area vs. slip scaling is derived.Effect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectTectonic seismicity and hydraulic fracturing b-value ranges are explained.Effect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectEffect of slip-area scaling on the earthquake frequency-magnitude relationship - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of earthquakes and climate in the formation of diamictic sediments in a New Zealand mountain lake - ScienceDirectThe role of earthquakes and climate in the formation of diamictic sediments in a New Zealand mountain lake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Water and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectWater and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe seismic inelastic behaviour of steel tanks is studied.Water and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectMultiple earthquake phenomena are examined.Water and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectBoth structure and fluid response are investigated.Water and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes - ScienceDirectThis study focuses on the inelastic response of water and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes. The main innovation of the proposed study has to do with the quantification of the seismic sequence effect into steel tanks, a phenomenon which has not been studied in the past. Firstly, this paper considers real seismic sequences that have been recorded during a short period of time (up to three days), by the same station, in the same direction, and almost at the same fault distance. In these cases, due to lack of time, any rehabilitation action is difficult or impractical and the multiplicity of earthquakes can lead to important damage accumulation. Furthermore, artificial seismic sequences are also examined where they have been generated by a rational and random combination of real single events. It is found that due to the multiple earthquakes effect, it seems to be unreliable to consider only single earthquake records in steel tank design process, since this long-established assumption leads to underestimated demands in terms of bearing capacity and deformation.Water and wastewater steel tanks under multiple earthquakes -

ScienceDirectThe simplified formula of the hydrodynamic force was developed by curve fitting method.Analytical solution and simplified formula for earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on elliptical hollow cylinders in water - ScienceDirectAnalytical expressions for calculating the hydrodynamic pressure on an elliptical hollow cylinder caused by outer and inner water under earthquake are obtained. Based on the radiation theory, the analytical solutions of hydrodynamic pressure and hydrodynamic force on elliptical hollow cylinder are accurately derived by assigning reasonable boundary conditions and by solving the Mathieu's differential equation in elliptical coordinate system. Added mass expressions distributed over the height of the cylinder are used to represent the hydrodynamic interaction effects, which are extracted from the hydrodynamic force expressions. These added mass expressions are so complicated that lead to their value difficult to be calculated. Therefore, these added mass expressions are dealt with dimensionless method and are simplified by curve fitting method in this study. The simplified formulas are only relevant to three dimensionless parameters including width-depth ratio, ratio of long to short axis of the ellipse and relative distance above base. The calculation results show that the simplified formulas are in good agreement with the analytical solutions.Analytical solution and simplified formula for earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on elliptical hollow cylinders in water - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectSliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectAftershock and tsunami may strike together on a coastal structure.Sliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectStability of breakwater becomes critical under combined effect of earthquake (aftershock) and tsunami.Sliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectStability is expressed in terms of factors of safety against sliding and overturning modes of failure.Sliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectThe pseudo-dynamic method was used to estimate seismic forces on breakwater.Sliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectSliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectPowerful tsunami waves were generated by the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake, and they struck the coast of Japan after few minutes of the main shock. Seismic aftershocks continued for several hours. Many coastal structures such as breakwaters, seawalls were damaged due to the earthquake and tsunami. It may be possible that some coastal structures were hit by the aftershock and the tsunami together. This paper focuses on this fact, and analyzes stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami. For estimating seismic inertia forces on breakwater, the pseudo-dynamic method was used, which considers seismic waves passing through body of breakwater with respect to depth and time. Stability of breakwater was assessed in terms of factors of safety against sliding and overturning modes of failure. It was found that stability of breakwater reduces drastically under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami as compared to only earthquake and only tsunami. Parameters such as seismic accelerations, height of tsunami wave, seawater level and width of breakwater have significant impacts on stability of breakwater under combined action of earthquake and tsunami. The design charts and tables, presented in this paper, will be helpful for design engineer to design a breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami in future.Sliding and overturning stability of breakwater under combined effect of earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectA survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectThe earthquake and/or tsunami during the GEJET had caused substantial damages and economic losses to the industries investigated.A survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectThe investigated industries were less prepared for the tsunami impact.A survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectLoss of electricity was reported as a major problem affecting operations at storage tanks and vessels, and pipeline systems.A survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectProcess units and atmospheric storage tanks were more vulnerable than other types of equipment.A survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectPublic communication programs on hazardous materials accidents preparedness were not available for most surveyed facilities.A survey of impact on industrial parks caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectDuring the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET), many industrial facilities were affected to different extents by the earthquake and/or tsunami.

ScienceDirectA new life cycle cost (LCC) analysis method is presented to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of energy-efficiency features in buildings by accounting for the future costs associated with earthquake-induced damages in such features. Buildings situated in a seismic zone are possibly attacked by earthquakes over lifetime and their nonstructural elements such as energy-efficiency features may suffer from various levels of damage, requiring repair or replacement to restore a satisfactory level of building energy efficiency. However, existing LCC analysis methods have overlooked such earthquake-related cost, potentially leading to unreliable cost-effectiveness assessment of energy-efficient buildings. To address this problem, we propose a method to rigorously quantify the expected cumulative future cost due to the repair/replacement of earthquake-damaged energy-efficiency features and then integrate this cost into the LCC analysis. The new method is illustrated using a medium-sized office building located in a high seismic region with a Mediterranean climate. Costs associated with the initial installation as well as future energy consumption, environmental impacts, and seismic damages of two alternative types of window assembly with different levels of energy efficiency are calculated and compared. It is found that, with seismic damage cost considered, the cost-effectiveness of energy-efficiency features can be noticeably reduced and, equivalently, the payback time for building energy efficiency investment is prolonged.Life cycle cost analysis of energy-efficient buildings subjected to earthquakes - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (69KB)Download full-size imageLife cycle cost analysis of energy-efficient buildings subjected to earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-period analysis of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake - ScienceDirectLong-period analysis of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake - ScienceDirectWe investigate the main features of the Kaikoura earthquake using long-period seismic waves.Long-period analysis of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake - ScienceDirectThe Kaikoura earthquake initiated as a small strike-slip rupture that propagated to the northeast.Long-period analysis of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake - ScienceDirectSlip on strike-slip faults triggered extensive thrust faulting under the eastern coast of the South Island.Long-period analysis of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake - ScienceDirectLong-period analysis of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectDamages to the Tawarayama Tunnel under the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes were investigated.Seismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic damage patterns occurred in the Tawarayama Tunnel were categorized into five patterns.Seismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectCorresponding influencing factors, as well as mechanism of deformation and damage, were given.Seismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectSome recommendations are proposed for the future tunnel planning.Seismic damage assessment of mountain tunnel: A case study on the Tawarayama tunnel due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake - ScienceDirectA Framework for Earthquake Risk Engineering - ScienceDirectCatastrophe risk engineering (CRE) is the field of engineering that quantifies the risk of individual assets exposed to natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, for the purpose of finding risk management solutions. An accurate estimation of the risk is essential for decision makers, such as risk managers or insurance brokers, who seek to either reduce or transfer the risk of the high-valuable assets in their portfolios.A Framework for Earthquake Risk Engineering - ScienceDirectCurrent practices in CRE use either oversimplifications of the structural systems and/or perform incremental dynamic analyses on limited number of ground motion records for the analyses selected by arbitrary heuristic methods. This paper proposes a novel framework for earthquake CRE. An accurate assessment of the earthquake risk requires a detailed analysis of the structural performance under site-specific seismic loading. Dynamic analyses of structures may be computationally expensive for complex structures, which are often overcome by simplifying assumptions at the expense of accuracy and rigor. The proposed framework uses a set of simulated ground-motion records consistent with the local-site seismicity. An efficient method based on stochastic reduced-order models is then used for running detailed dynamic analyses for the structural system.A Framework for Earthquake Risk Engineering - ScienceDirectThe methodology proposed is validated for linear and non-linear systems located in a highly-seismic zone. Comparisons between the newly proposed and the traditional CRE frameworks are conducted.Predictive models for the localization of soil liquefaction in earthquakes on the Main Sayan Fault (southern East Siberia) - ScienceDirectPredictive models for the localization of soil liquefaction in earthquakes on the Main Sayan Fault (southern East Siberia) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Patterns of stress drop in earthquakes of the Northern Tien Shan - ScienceDirectPatterns of stress drop in earthquakes of the Northern Tien Shan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Implications for elastic energy storage in the Himalaya from the Gorkha 2015 earthquake and other incomplete ruptures of the Main Himalayan Thrust - ScienceDirectTsunami inundation variability from stochastic rupture scenarios: Application to multiple inversions of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake - ScienceDirectTsunami inundation variability from stochastic rupture scenarios: Application to multiple inversions of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake - ScienceDirectExploring a tsunami scenarios for a Mw 9 mega-thrust subduction earthquake.Tsunami inundation variability from stochastic rupture scenarios: Application to multiple inversions of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake - ScienceDirectAssessing the sensitivity and variability of tsunami inundation due to a mega-thrust subduction earthquake.Tsunami inundation variability from stochastic rupture scenarios: Application to multiple inversions of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake - ScienceDirectThe sensitivity and variability of tsunami hazard parameters along the coast based on multiple reference earthquake source models.Tsunami inundation variability from stochastic rupture scenarios: Application to multiple inversions of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake - ScienceDirectWe develop a framework for assessing the sensitivity and variability of tsunami inundation characteristics for stochastic physics-based scenarios of mega-thrust subduction earthquakes. The method is applied to the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake, and tested against observed inundation maps at several locations along the Tohoku coast, using 11 different, previously published, rupture models for this devastating tsunamgenic earthquake. The earthquake rupture models differ in fault dimension (length and width), geometry (dip, strike and top-edge depth), as well as asperity characteristics (slip heterogeneity on the fault plane). The resulting source variability allows exploring a wide range of tsunami scenarios for an Mw9 mega-thrust subduction earthquake in the Tohoku region to conduct thorough sensitivity analyses and to quantify the inundation variability. The numerical results indicate a strong influence of the reference source models on inundation variability, and demonstrate significant sensitivity of inundation to the details of the rupture realization. Therefore, relying on a single particular earthquake rupture model as a representative case when varying earthquake source characteristics may lead to under-representation of the variability of potential scenarios. Moreover, the proposed framework facilitates the rigorous development of critical scenarios for tsunami hazard and risk assessments, which are particularly useful for tsunami hazard mapping and disaster preparedness planning.Tsunami inundation variability from stochastic rupture scenarios: Application to multiple inversions of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depth varying rupture properties during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake - ScienceDirectDepth varying rupture properties during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectEffects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectNew reinforcing model for foundation of breakwater.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectEffective countermeasures for foundation of breakwater to make the breakwater resilient against earthquake induced damage.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectShaking table tests and numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate its effectiveness under different earthquake ground motions.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectCould prevent bearing capacity failure of foundation, and reduce settlement and horizontal displacement of the breakwater.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectThe reinforced foundation model can mitigate the damage of breakwater caused by foreshocks and main shock.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectThis paper describes an effective reinforcement technique for foundation of breakwater in order to provide resiliency to the breakwater against earthquake and tsunami related compound geo-disaster. As reinforcing measures, the technique uses gabions and sheet piles in the foundation of the breakwater. A series of shaking table tests were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the technique under different earthquake loadings, and comparisons were made between conventional and reinforced foundation. The results of these tests reveal the advantages of the reinforcing foundation technique in terms of reduction in settlement and horizontal displacement of the breakwater during the earthquake loadings. Duration and level of acceleration of earthquake loadings had significant impacts on the settlement and horizontal displacement of the breakwater. It was found that one of the reasons of settlement of the breakwater is lateral flow of foundation soils during earthquake, and the sheet piles could reduce the lateral flow. The excess pore water pressures could be reduced significantly during earthquake due to the reinforcing technique. Numerical analyses were also performed to confirm the effectiveness of the technique, and to determine behavior of the reinforcement-soil-breakwater system during the earthquakes.Effects of duration and acceleration level of earthquake ground motion on the behavior of unreinforced and reinforced breakwater foundation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of earthquake source complexity and land elevation data resolution on tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation - ScienceDirectImpact of earthquake source complexity and land elevation data resolution on tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation - ScienceDirectEffect of DEM resolution and earthquake source complexity on tsunami hazard and risk assessment is investigated.Impact of earthquake source complexity and land elevation data resolution on tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation - ScienceDirectEarthquake slip model is a major uncertainty parameter.Impact of earthquake source complexity and land elevation data resolution on tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation - ScienceDirectBig data may be generated through this work for tsunami disaster risk management purposes.Impact of earthquake source complexity and land elevation data resolution on tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation - ScienceDirectOn the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectOn the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectWe analyse a model of groundwater responses to the recent Canterbury/Christchurch earthquakes.On the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectChanges in aquifer properties are modelled as shocks.On the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectWe argue that the model explains the essential mechanisms of earthquake induced changes.On the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectWe fit the model to data from the 4 September 2010 earthquake and interpret the results.On the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectOn the mechanism of earthquake induced groundwater flow - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirect3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirect3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirect3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirectRupture plane of the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake was influenced by fault geometry.3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirect3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirect3D geometry of a plate boundary fault related to the 2016 Off-Mie earthquake in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan - ScienceDirectEarthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectEarthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectSeveral earthquake swarms followed Indian Ocean mega-earthquakes of 2004 and 2012.Earthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectThe swarms were situated beneath distinct seamounts of the submarine volcanic arc.Earthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectEarthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectThe swarms were probably generated by magma unrest induced by mega-earthquakes.Earthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectEarthquake swarms reveal submarine magma unrest induced by distant mega-earthquakes: Andaman Sea region - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mid-continental earthquakes: Spatiotemporal occurrences, causes, and hazards - ScienceDirectLarge earthquakes in North China, Australia, Northwestern Europe, Central and Eastern United States, and other mid-continents show complex spatiotemporal patterns that do not fit existing earthquake models. Individual faults or fault zones tend to fall into long term (thousands of years or longer) dormancy after a cluster of ruptures, whereas large earthquakes seem to roam between widespread faults. These behaviors are characteristic of complex dynamic systems of interacting faults. In such systems, widespread faults collectively accommodate slow tectonic loading, and a major fault rupture both transfers stress to the neighboring faults and perturbs loading conditions on distant faults. Because of the slow tectonic loading, local stress variations from fault interaction or nontectonic processes, or changes of fault strength, could trigger mid-continental earthquakes. The precise spatiotemporal occurrence of large mid-continental earthquakes may be unknowable, an intrinsic limitation of complex dynamic systems, but their qualitative system behavior may be understood by a system approach. This approach would render some commonly used concepts, such as seismic cycles, recurrence intervals, characteristic earthquakes, and seismic gaps inadequate or irrelevant in mid-continents, and calls for rethinking of the probability estimates based on these concepts. It requires a better understanding of fault interactions on multiple spatial and temporal scales rather than focusing solely on the balance of tectonic loading and yield strength of individual faults or fault segments. It also indicates the need for paleoseismic and geodetic studies extending beyond areas where recent large earthquakes occurred, and for hazard assessments to reduce the biasing influence of the most recent large earthquakes that tend to dominate the short and incomplete earthquake records.Mid-continental earthquakes: Spatiotemporal occurrences, causes, and hazards - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The 2015 Nepal earthquake disaster: lessons learned one year on - ScienceDirectThe 2015 earthquake in Nepal killed over 8000 people, injured more than 21,000 and displaced a further 2 million.

These directional variations need to be included in the earthquake-induced landslide hazard assessment. This paper examines the influence of ground motion directionality on the probabilistic seismic displacement hazard of slopes. The distribution of the orientation of the maximum sliding displacement direction are analyzed, and the optimal ground motion parameters are provided by which the displacement in the orientation of maximum ground motion parameters can be used to represent the maximum sliding displacement over all orientations. Predictive relationships of orientation-independent sliding displacements are developed for different types of ground motions (i.e., forward-directivity pulse and non-pulse ground motions). The proposed relationships for sliding displacement are based on ground motion parameters for which there are available ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs), hence allowing for fully compatible hazard analyses with existing GMPEs. Probabilistic assessment of earthquake-induced landslide hazard is performed for hypothetical slopes, and the seismic landslide hazard maps and the ground-motion selection procedure for site-specific analysis of slopes are presented by including the effects of ground motion directionality in different types of ground motions.Probabilistic assessment of earthquake-induced landslide hazard including the effects of ground motion directionality - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.VLF radio wave anomalies associated with the 2010 Ms 7.1 Yushu earthquake - ScienceDirectVLF radio wave anomalies associated with the 2010 Ms 7.1 Yushu earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectEarthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectCorrelation between the seismic structure and seismogenesis in the Nepal Himalaya.Earthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectDelineation of a low velocity layer that corresponds to the Lesser Himalaya sedimentary duplex above the MHT flat.Earthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectLateral variations in upper crustal structure control rupture propagation.Earthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectTectonic loading on the duplex caused internal deformation localizing bulk of the aftershocks.Earthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectEarthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (164KB)Download full-size imageEarthquake genesis in Nepal Himalaya: A perspective from imaging of the 25th April 2015 Mw 7.8 earthquake source zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectSeismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectA seismic displacement model for soil is presented that includes multidirectional earthquake shaking and compliance effects.Seismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectThe stress vector computed for a multidirectional compliant Newmark model is more accurate than traditional 1-D models.Seismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectCompliance effects on seismic displacement can be modeled using a Plastic Displacement Response Spectra.Seismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectGentle sediment-laden slopes are typical of the onshore coastal zone and offshore continental shelf and slope. Coastal sediment are commonly young weakly consolidated materials that are well stratified, have low strength, and can mobilize shear displacements at low levels of stress. Seismically-driven plastic displacements of these sediment pose a hazard to coastal cities, buried onshore utilities, and offshore infrastructure like harbor protection and outfalls. One-dimensional rigid downslope-directed Newmark sliding block analyses have been used to predict earthquake deformations generally on steeper slopes that are modeled as frictional materials. This study probes the effect of multidirectional earthquake motions on inertial displacements of gently sloping ground of the coastal and offshore condition where soft-compliant soil is expected. Toward that objective, this investigation seeks to understand the effect on Newmark-type displacements of [1] multidirectional earthquake shaking and [2] soil compliance. In order to model multidirectional effects, the earthquake motions are rotated into the local slope strike- and dip-components. On gently sloping ground, including the strike component of motion always results in a larger and more accurate shear stress vector. Strike motions are found to contribute to downslope deformations on any declivity. Compliant response of the soil mass also influences the plastic displacements. The magnitude of seismic displacements can be estimated with a simplified model using only the estimated soil yield-acceleration (ky) and the peak ground velocity (Vmax) of the earthquake motions. Compliance effects can be effectively mapped using the concept of Plastic Displacement Response Spectra (PDRS).Seismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (313KB)Download full-size imageSeismic displacement of gently-sloping coastal and marine sediment under multidirectional earthquake loading - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Lake Baikal's response to remote earthquakes: Lake-level fluctuations and near-bottom water layer temperature change - ScienceDirectLake Baikal's response to remote earthquakes: Lake-level fluctuations and near-bottom water layer temperature change - ScienceDirectAmplitude of the Lake level oscillations caused by teleseismic waves depends also on the earthquake focal mechanism.Lake Baikal's response to remote earthquakes: Lake-level fluctuations and near-bottom water layer temperature change - ScienceDirectThe subsurface sedimentary layer bearing gas hydrates can be sensitive to the passage of seismic waves.Lake Baikal's response to remote earthquakes: Lake-level fluctuations and near-bottom water layer temperature change - ScienceDirectGas hydrate formation/dissociation is supposed to be a cause of the observed temperature change of the near-bottom waters.Lake Baikal's response to remote earthquakes: Lake-level fluctuations and near-bottom water layer temperature change - ScienceDirectLake Baikal's response to remote earthquakes: Lake-level fluctuations and near-bottom water layer temperature change - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Response of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectResponse of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectImproved repair regressions of water distribution pipelines affected by earthquakes.Response of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectScale affects the relationship between pipeline damage and lateral ground strain.Response of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectPVC pipelines most resilient to permanent and transient ground deformation effects.Response of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectRepair correlations with combined differential lateral and vertical ground movements.Response of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectThe effects of transient and permanent ground deformations during the 22 February 2011 earthquake on the Christchurch water distribution system are investigated through geospatial analysis with the most detailed and accurate databases currently available. Using the most recent repair records, ground motion records, high resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data collected before and after the earthquake, and improved screening criteria, repair rates, expressed as repairs/km, for different types of pipeline are correlated with 1) peak ground velocity outside liquefaction areas, and 2) differential ground surface lateral and vertical movements in liquefaction areas. The substantial influence of LiDAR resolution on the relationship between pipeline damage and lateral ground strain indicates sensitivity of repair regressions to the degree of data resolution. Repair regressions of different pipelines show that polyvinyl chloride pipelines are markedly more resilient to earthquake effects than other types of segmental pipelines in the Christchurch system. The analytical process is described in detail for assistance in future investigations with data sets of similar size and complexity.Response of the Christchurch water distribution system to the 22 February 2011 earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Outcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectOutcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectFull scale fire tests have been conducted on pre-damaged RC structures.Outcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectThe effect of pre-damage and confinement on post earthquake behavior of RC Structures has been studied.Outcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectExtensive data extracted to develop numerical and computer models.Outcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectThe uniform heating of structures given in codes does not hold valid in real fire scenarios.Outcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectPost-earthquake fire (PEF) can cause a rapid collapse of structures that have been already damaged as a consequence of prior earthquake. It is a matter of concern for all the stake holders that almost all the standards and codes for the design of structures ignore the risk of PEF and thus the designs developed using these codes could be ineffective during the PEF events. This paper represents the results of a major research carried on four full scale RC frames. A novel test setup for fire following earthquake has been developed and tested in the current exercise. A number of sensors were used to monitor the kinematic and thermal fields during the test. The results (in terms of strains, displacements and temperatures) provide valuable information about earthquake-damaged RC structures in fire in fully developed and decay stages. The study investigated the effect of the pre-damage level, the reinforcement detailing and the infill on the performance of RC frames subjected to post earthquake fire. The results show significant variation in structural temperatures within a compartment, demonstrating that the assumption of uniform temperature, which is implicit in many design fires, is incorrect. The RC frames designed with ductile detailing of reinforcement displayed better lateral load carrying capacities before and after fire. The pre-damage level affects the rise in temperatures in the structural elements and also affects the spalling of the members. This paper describes the experimental investigation and serves as a vehicle for dissemination of the key findings and all the important test data to the engineering community which could be used for validating numerical simulations for further advancing the knowledge and understanding in this relatively poorly researched area.Outcomes of a major research on full scale testing of RC frames in post earthquake fire - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectMultiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectThe trench was excavated across the surface rupture of earthquake.Multiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectThe surface rupture is connected to the underground active fault.Multiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectMultiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectThe seismogenic faults of two earthquakes occurred on the same day are different.Multiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectMultiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (326KB)Download full-size imageMultiple faulting events revealed by trench analysis of the seismogenic structure of the 1976 Ms7.1 Luanxian earthquake, Tangshan Region, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectEstimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectSloshing simulation is performed for oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectA strong ground motion of the possible Nankai Trough earthquake with MW9.0 in an industrial complex is estimated.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectNumerical results based on the explicit MPS demonstrate large amount of oil is overflowed from a large tank due to sloshing.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectEstimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectSloshing of oil storage tanks is a great threat to industrial complexes when huge earthquakes occur. Overflow of oil due to sloshing could lead to serious tank fire and to oil dispersion due to Tsunamis. Since liquid sloshing is characterized as a highly nonlinear free-surface flow, numerical approaches are more suitable than theoretical ones to estimate the overflow from oil storage tanks caused by sloshing. The moving particle simulation (MPS) method, which is a mesh-free and Lagrangian particle method, is applied to the sloshing simulation. Thanks to the perfect mass conservation of the particle method, the overflow amount of oil can be accurately estimated by simply counting the number of overflowed fluid particles.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectThere is high-possibility of occurrence of huge earthquakes along the Nankai Trough subduction zone, and the worst scenario is presumed as MW9.0, which is the same as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. In order to simulate sloshing of oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake, ground shaking characteristics of the site need to be evaluated. Therefore we carried out microtremor measurements with high density in an industrial complex in Osaka bay area. A strong ground motion during a scenario earthquake with MW9.0 along the Nankai Trough is estimated based on the SMGA models considering the empirical site amplification and phase effects.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectFully nonlinear sloshing simulations, using an in-house GPU computing code based on the explicit MPS method, are performed for a large-size oil storage tank installed with a floating roof by imposing the estimated strong ground motion of Nankai Trough earthquake as the external oscillation. As a result, significant amount of oil flows onto the floating roof and large amount of oil overflow from the tank is confirmed. The numerical result suggests the entire fire is one of major concerns for the assumed earthquake scenario. Finally sloshing simulations are repeated for small- and medium-size tanks, and then the total amount of outflow oil is estimated for the industrial complex of interest in the estimated Nankai Trough earthquake.Estimation of oil overflow due to sloshing from oil storage tanks subjected to a possible Nankai Trough earthquake in Osaka bay area - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Re-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectRe-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectIsoseismal maps and intensity-derived epicenters define the approximate locations of instrumental and historical earthquakes.Re-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe RFBT is the seismogenic fault of the 1970 Ms 6.2 Dayi and 2013 Mw 6.6 Lushan earthquakes.Re-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectRe-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectRe-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectRe-evaluating seismic hazard along the southern Longmen Shan, China: Insights from the 1970 Dayi and 2013 Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectAccumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectA method used for evaluating damage of bridge under both earthquake and tsunami is presented.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectSeismic analysis and impact analysis are conducted.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectImpact force, direction and velocity due to tsunami are obtained based on tsunami analysis.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectThe coupled earthquake-tsunami effect is investigated.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectThe coupled earthquake-tsunami damage cannot be ignored.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectDuring the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake occurring at the north-east pacific region, serious secondary disasters caused by collision of drifting containers or ships occurred in various structures when tsunami came. Disaster deterioration caused by earthquake and drifting object impact during earthquake and tsunami has become another problem. This study presents an effective method to evaluate the accumulative response of steel bridge under earthquake and large drifting object impact due to tsunami flow, and the earthquake and tsunami come from the same fault motion. The main innovation has to do with the quantification of the earthquake effect and the ship-impact effect due to earthquake-induced tsunami directly into ductility demands, a phenomenon which has not been studied in the past. A series of seismic response analysis and impact analysis are carried out, and damage to the main tower of bridge is evaluated by means of elastic-plastic finite element analysis. This study shows that piers of main tower of bridge can be severely damaged due to the earthquake and ship impact effect compared to only impact effect. An effective evaluated method that could be useful for evaluating damage of lifeline engineering under such mega earthquake and tsunami is proposed.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Accumulative response of large offshore steel bridge under severe earthquake and ship impact due to earthquake-induced tsunami flow - ScienceDirectFormerly.Alterations in physique among young children after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Results from a nationwide survey - ScienceDirectAlterations in physique among young children after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Results from a nationwide survey - ScienceDirectAlterations in physique among young children after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Results from a nationwide survey - ScienceDirectAnthropometric data were measured before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake.Alterations in physique among young children after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Results from a nationwide survey - ScienceDirectWe compared the data in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima vs. the other prefectures.Alterations in physique among young children after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Results from a nationwide survey - ScienceDirectIncident overweight was higher in the three prefectures than the other prefectures.Alterations in physique among young children after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Results from a nationwide survey - ScienceDirectData for earthquake-related alterations in physique among young children in developed countries is lacking.

The movement of tectonic plates and their overlapping is often unpredictable and can occur at any geographical location. In most earthquake events, it takes few seconds for the earthquake to reach several miles, across countries, continents and cause major destruction. Even after an earthquake has occurred, the aftershocks and tsunami threats haunt people living in the effected region. In this research, we mainly focus on the importance of ICT for disaster management and how ICT can be helpful in disseminating earthquake alerts. Also with application of Wireless Sensor Networks, how we can design Early Warning Systems or Earthquake Prediction Systems. We would be emphasizing on Earthquake prediction methods and disaster management strategies using ICT and Wireless Sensor Networks.

ScienceDirectIn the scope of this paper, it is aimed to compare the effects of near and far-fault earthquakes on the seismic responses (amplitude, spectrum effect, stress) of a relatively complex historical stone masonry mosque (125-years old Kurtulus Mosque, Gaziantep-Turkey) through soil-structure-interaction (SSI) analysis as well as fixed base solution. The SSI analysis (using direct approach) has also been performed for the effect of boundary types (viscous, elementary) of substructure. A 3D finite element modeling of mosque and substructure soil is built with solid elements, and then the seismic responses of mosque are evaluated by time-history analysis. The near and far-fault motions, which have approximately identical peak ground accelerations from same earthquake, are selected by representing their own characteristics (i.e., velocity, distance, etc.) from the strong ground motion records in previous earthquakes (1979 Imperial Valley, 1992 Erzincan, 1999 Chi-Chi, 1999 Kocaeli, 2010 Darfield). It is found from the results that both the near and far-fault earthquakes mostly lead to the responses similarly significant for both the fixed base and SSI considerations. However, regarding the resonance effect on the mosque, the far-fault motion appears more prominent in fixed base solution. Moreover, the far-fault motions mostly result in high amplitudes in the viscous boundary of SSI compared to the elementary boundary. When compared to the fixed base and SSI due to the near and far-fault effects, it is seen that the SSI increases amplitude and stresses. Overall from the comparisons, the study indicates that the far-fault motion could be employed together with the near-fault motions for assessment of such historical mosques for further considerations.Effect of near-fault and far-fault earthquakes on a historical masonry mosque through 3D dynamic soil-structure interaction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake sequence: I.

Kathmandu valley witnessed severe damage in terms of structural collapse and casualties. Apart from this, soil liquefaction in the form of sand blows and lateral spreading were observed in 12 locations. Soil liquefaction in Kathmandu valley during 1934 (MW 8.1) earthquake was believed to be one of the major cause of damage in structures and lifelines but detail records are not available. To fulfill the gap of documentation in case of strong earthquake events like the Gorkha earthquake, field reconnaissance and collection of samples from each sand blow location have been carried out. In addition to this, numerical analyses based on geotechnical investigation records for seven locations that manifested sand blows have been performed. Common approach of liquefaction susceptibility analysis based on standard penetration resistance is found to be consistent with the surface manifestations. Our comparison between existing susceptibility maps and results of numerical analyses as well as field evidence concludes that the existing susceptibility maps are unrepresentative.Soil liquefaction in Kathmandu valley due to 25 April 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.NEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectNEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectEarthquake Early Warning System for forecasting earthquake magnitude and location.NEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectIt combines of a classification algorithm with a mathematical optimization algorithm.NEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectClassification algorithms are neural dynamic classification, PNN, EPNN, and SVM.NEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectThe optimization algorithm is the neural dynamics model of Adeli and Park.NEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectThe model is tested using earthquake data in southern California.NEEWS: A novel earthquake early warning model using neural dynamic classification and neural dynamic optimization - ScienceDirectAn Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS) can save lives. It can also be used to manage the critical lifeline infrastructure and essential facilities. Recent research on earthquake prediction towards the development of an EEWS can be classified into two groups based on a) arrival of P waves and b) seismicity indicators. The first approach can provide warnings within a timeframe of seconds. A seismicity indicator-based EEWS is intended to forecast major earthquakes within a time frame of weeks. In this paper, a novel seismicity indicator-based EEWS model, called neural EEWS (NEEWS), is presented for forecasting the earthquake magnitude and its location weeks before occurrence using a combination of a classification algorithm (CA) based on machine learning concepts and a mathematical optimization algorithm (OA). The role of the CA is to find whether there is an earthquake in a given time period greater than a predefined magnitude threshold and the role of the OA is to find the location of that earthquake with the maximum probability of occurrence. The model is tested using earthquake data in southern California with a combination of four CAs and one OA to find the best EEWS model. The proposed model is capable of predicting strong disastrous events as long as sufficient data are available for such events.

The proposed outrigger TIMET systems consist of the outrigger and TIMET parts. The outrigger damping systems have been proposed as a novel energy dissipation approach to high-rise buildings, in which control devices are installed vertically between the outrigger and perimeter columns to achieve large energy dissipation. While the TIMET has been developed based on the mechanism of the tuned viscous mass damper (TVMD) which can improve energy absorbing capability by taking advantage of resonance effect. However, instead of a viscous material, the damping of the TIMET is provided by a motor which can convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. The focus of this study is to investigate the structural control performance and energy harvesting efficiency of the proposed outrigger TIMET system for high-rise buildings subjected to long period earthquakes through numerical simulations.Outrigger tuned inertial mass electromagnetic transducers for high-rise buildings subject to long period earthquakes -

ScienceDirectThe Wenchuan earthquake was China's worst natural disaster of the past three decades. Although the psychological sequelae of disasters can last for many years, the long-term sequelae and their risk factors tend to receive little research attention.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectThe objectives of the present study were to estimate the prevalences of symptomalogical PTSD and depression among survivors 8 years after the Wenchuan earthquake, and to identify the shared and unshared risk factors associated with PTSD and depression, using data from a cross-sectional survey.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirect1369 participants were recruited from two different sites in the areas that were severely affected by the earthquake. Symptomalogical PTSD was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The Chinese edition of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depression. Traumatic exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake was assessed using an exposure checklist designed by this study.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectEight years after the Wenchuan earthquake, 11.8% of the respondents had symptomalogical PTSD, and 24.8% of respondents had probable depression. The results also indicated that female gender, low education, poor perceived health, and traumatic experiences after the earthquake were associated with higher odds of both PTSD and depression among survivors. Direct exposure to the earthquake was associated with comorbid symptomalogical PTSD and depression (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.42, 2.44). Those having only depression were more likely to be unmarried/divorced/widowed, and to have experienced fear at the time of the earthquake (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.04, 1.72), while those with only symptomalogical PTSD were likely to be from the township of Yongan as opposed to Guangji (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.06, 3.31).Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectThis is a cross-sectional study, and thus is insufficient for determining causal relationships with regard to chronic PTSD or depression.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectThe results of this study indicate that symptomalogical PTSD and depression persist among many survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake, 8 eight years later.

The behavior of citizens is critical to understanding waste management and SC is an important element of community resilience. SC reveals the strength of relationships and the structure of networks in a community. There is, however, limited understanding about how SC affects waste management and other recovery activities, and how it changes over time. The coastal cities of Iwate and Miyagi prefectures were among the most heavily damaged communities during the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) in March of 2011. Residents of these communities experienced many challenges related to waste management and recovery from the disaster. A web survey was used to collect data on waste management activities. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with a Malmquist Productivity Index was used to analyze the 520 valid responses. This study defines inputs based on community and individual resilience attributes, including SC. Outputs are defined by the level of waste management activities, including collection, separation and transportation. Efficiency of waste management improved by the quality change in citizen skills and knowledge of earthquake waste management. The effect of quality change was larger than the quantity change in the operation rate. The quality change of earthquake waste management improved throughout the disaster. While the quality change of waste management persisted over the longer term recovery period the operation rate, however, declined.Social capital and efficiency of earthquake waste management in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gravity variation before the Akto Ms6.7 earthquake, Xinjiang - ScienceDirectGravity variation before the Akto Ms6.7 earthquake, Xinjiang - ScienceDirectHongtao Hao, Assistant research fellow of Hubei Earthquake Administration.

Compared to ground observations, one obvious advantage is their global coverage. Based on previous experiments, the possible mechanisms of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling are discussed. Some new relations that confirm recently proposed amplification mechanisms in the atmosphere are suggested and corresponding parameters to study in future space experiments are proposed. It is concluded that given the current state of space technology, a low-cost multi-satellite mission could be realized both from scientific and technological points of view. Finally, a possible payload composition for cubesats is recommended.Possibility to detect earthquake precursors using cubesats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Farmers' risk perception of concentrated rural settlement development after the 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake - ScienceDirectFarmers' risk perception of concentrated rural settlement development after the 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake - ScienceDirectInvestigate the farmers' risk perception of concentrated rural settlement (CRS).Farmers' risk perception of concentrated rural settlement development after the 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake - ScienceDirectThe characteristics of villages and of farmers can influence farmers' risk perception of CRS development.Farmers' risk perception of concentrated rural settlement development after the 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake - ScienceDirectFacilitate local governments to identify suitable approaches to mitigate risk of CRS.Farmers' risk perception of concentrated rural settlement development after the 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake - ScienceDirectRural housing reconstruction is critical in realizing sustainable recovery. Concentrated rural settlement (CRS) was widely promoted under the context of new countryside construction after the 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake in 2008. Farmers' risk perception of CRS and their corresponding actions affect realizing sustainable recovery. However, few studies have attempted to comprehend farmers' risk perception of such practices, and the impact factors of risk perception remain unknown. Therefore, this study investigates farmers' risk perception of CRS development using four cases in the hardest earthquake-hit area. ANOVA is employed to explore the factors that influence risk perception of CRS development, and in-depth discussions are conducted to explore the reasons behind such perceptions. Potential measures are proposed to reduce relevant risk factors. This study's findings can help local governments in understanding the concerns of farmers toward CRS and in identifying suitable approaches to mitigate risks in order to realize the sustainability of CRS development. This study also provides references for local government to address the specialized concerns when developing CRS within both disaster and non-disaster context.The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectThe surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectThe surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectStrong interactions occurred in Sumatra, Kuril, and Tonga subduction zones.The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectEleven events ruptured megathrust faults near identified seismic gaps.The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectGlobal seismic, geodetic, and tsunami data provide detailed rupture models.The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectPotential exists for great events in the Mentawai and northern Chile gaps.The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectThe surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014 - ScienceDirectThorne Lay is Distinguished Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he has been located since 1990.

The main types of earthquake-induced failures were liquefaction and slope failures and were mainly widespread at the western and central part of the island at Paliki peninsula. Although the fact that the generated strong motions by the second event were the highest ever recorded in Greece, medium severity structural damages were induced. Few days after the occurrence of the events, two post-earthquake field surveys took place in order to document the generated environmental effects. By taking into account these field observations, it was decided to evaluate the macroseismic intensity of the February 3rd, 2014 earthquake by applying the ESI-07 scale. As an outcome, the epicentral intensity of Feb. 3rd, 2014 was evaluated as VII ESI-07 by taking into account the total affected area. Furthermore, as it is pointed out in primary contemporary sources and seismic catalogues, similar environmental failures such as liquefaction phenomena at coastal areas and large scale rockfalls were triggered by historical earthquakes at the island of Cephalonia. The most accurately described effects are the ones triggered by the 1867 earthquake. Therefore, it was decided to assess the macroseismic intensities of this historical event based on the ESI-07 scale and compare it with the relevant ones of Feb 3rd, 2014 event. As an outcome, it is concluded that similar intensities were assessed for both events, VIII ESI-07 for 1867 event and VII ESI-07 for the February 2014 one, despite the fact that the relevant earthquake magnitudes strongly differ. Outlining the results of this study, it is reconfirmed the importance of the recording and documentation of earthquake environmental effects in order to maintain the consistency with the historical earthquake catalogues. Moreover, a re-evaluation of historical earthquake magnitudes at the area of Cephalonia island could be realized in order to accurately update the seismic hazard.Evaluation of the macroseismic intensities triggered by the January/February 2014 Cephalonia, (Greece) earthquakes based on ESI-07 scale and their comparison to 1867 historical event - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analyze on Effect and Building Regulation in Northern Thailand's Earthquake, May 2014: Chiangmai's Residents Risk Perception and Response to Earthquake - ScienceDirectAfter 05th May 2014, a magnitude of 6.3 struck Chiangrai province, where locate at northern part of Thailand. It was the strongest earthquake ever recorded occurs in the country, according to National Disaster Warning Center. This earthquake caused damage to buildings, houses, schools and historical buildings and creating many problems for resident's life and so far, are continue rising fear to the residents who live in risk zone (10 provinces in North and plus Bangkok: Kanchanaburi, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Tak, Nan, Phayao, Phrae, Lampang, Lamphun and Mae Hong Son) what should we plan if future quakes from 7 active-fault lines in North are active in stronger shakes. This study would like to 1. Summarize the policy and building regulations. 2. Analyze response and resident's perception in earthquake situation of May 2015. According to Ministerial Regulation B.E. 2550, The law stipulated that Thailand's tall buildings (15 meters or higher) must be built to withstand more than magnitude 6 and tall building constructed after 2007 have to follow on Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures to able to the stand up to 7 magnitude, So the building are safer from earthquake damage compare to buildings in another areas. Nevertheless this regulation not cover to individual households where most of residents living and also not cover many type of public building such as temple or not enforce the building that built before 2007 to be earthquake resist. The situations are still risk for future damage, too.Analyze on Effect and Building Regulation in Northern Thailand's Earthquake, May 2014: Chiangmai's Residents Risk Perception and Response to Earthquake - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Dept of Transportation Engineering, University of Seoul.The effects of relocation and social support on long-term outcomes of adolescents following a major earthquake: A controlled study from Turkey - ScienceDirectThe effects of relocation and social support on long-term outcomes of adolescents following a major earthquake: A controlled study from Turkey - ScienceDirectAdolescents who survived the earthquake six years ago had higher psychiatric symptoms when compared with the control group.The effects of relocation and social support on long-term outcomes of adolescents following a major earthquake: A controlled study from Turkey - ScienceDirectRelocation did not have a significant effect on psychiatric symptoms and PTSD.The effects of relocation and social support on long-term outcomes of adolescents following a major earthquake: A controlled study from Turkey - ScienceDirectPerceived family support has a protective role on PTSD symptoms of adolescents after earthquake.The effects of relocation and social support on long-term outcomes of adolescents following a major earthquake: A controlled study from Turkey - ScienceDirectEarthquake and subsequent relocation adversely affects adolescents' the mental health. Migration may disturb social support system and negatively effects on the well-being of adolescents. We aimed to investigate the long-term effects of relocation, social support following the earthquake on the mental health of adolescents by comparing a control group. This study completed with 434 high school students. Study group compose of 230 adolescents who had survived Van earthquake, (98 adolescents relocated and 132 did not). The control group consisted of 204 adolescents. The data of the study were collected using an information collection form, Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - Reaction index, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Perceived Social Support Scale-Revised. There was a significant difference in the PTSD scores between earthquake and control groups, and also a significant difference in BSI scores between the groups. Participants who had witnessed the death or injury of a family member or friend had significantly higher PTSD scores than others. There were no significant differences in the PTSD and BSI scores between relocated group and not relocated group. In regression analyses, Perceived Family Support was significant predictor of PTSD scores, however neither Perceived Friend Support nor Perceived Teacher Support was found to be a significant predictor. In the long term, the earthquake continues to have a negative effect on adolescents' mental health; however, family support has been found to help adolescents to cope with psychological problems. Strengthening social support systems may play an important role in preventive mental health and psychological rebuilding.The effects of relocation and social support on long-term outcomes of adolescents following a major earthquake: A controlled study from Turkey - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectThe effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectParameter space study of prism size, prism compliance and sub-prism friction.The effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectCompliant prisms often cause greater slip and larger tsunamis.The effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectBut some sets of parameters show decreased slip with greater compliance.The effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectThe effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectLarger, more compliant prisms generate tsunamis more efficiently.The effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectThe effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of compliant prisms on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis - ScienceDirectFunding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (EAR-1255439) and the Alfred P.

Proper estimation of NSYS values will lead to more accurate estimation of axial force demand in columns which will result in economical design of columns. In this procedure, the main pulse of the velocity record responsible for causing the maximum number of stories to yield simultaneously was identified and isolated to idealize it by a full-sine velocity pulse, as an extension of the procedure for estimating the NSYS for a full-sine pulse velocity base excitation developed previously by the authors. A set of eighteen earthquake records sorted into three categories of earthquakes were considered, namely: earthquake excitations having (i) a single dominant pulse (ii) multiple distinct pulses, and; (iii) no distinct pulses in their velocity record. Since most of these earthquakes have relatively long duration main pulses, another set of eighteen earthquake records was obtained by condensing their acceleration time scale and was used to study the proposed procedure for earthquakes that have shorter duration main pulses. The estimated maximum value of NSYS obtained from the proposed procedure was found to be adequately close to the actual value observed from OpenSees analysis for the structures and earthquakes considered.Estimating number of simultaneously yielding stories in a shear building subjected to earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Estimating number of simultaneously yielding stories in a shear building subjected to earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectFormerly Graduate Research Assistant, Dept. of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.A contrast study of the traumatic condition between the wounded in 5.12 Wenchuan earthquake and 4.25 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirect5.12 Wenchuan earthquake and 4.25 Nepal earthquake are of the similar magnitude, but the climate and geographic environment are totally different.

With few exceptions, the observed seismicity extends only along the continental margins of Greenland, which almost coincide with the ice sheet margin. This pattern has been put forward as further validation of the earthquake suppression hypothesis. In this review, new evidence in terms of ice melting, post-glacial rebound and earthquake occurrence is gathered and discussed to re-evaluate the connection between ice mass unloading and earthquake suppression. In Greenland, the spatio-temporal distribution of earthquakes indicates that seismicity is mainly confined to regions where the thick layer of ice is absent and where significant ice melting is presently occurring. A clear correlation between seismic activity and ice melting in Greenland is not found. However, earthquake locations and corresponding depth distributions suggest two distinct governing mechanisms: post-glacial rebound promotes moderate-size crustal earthquakes at Greenland's regional scale, while current ice melting promotes shallow low magnitude seismicity locally.History of the great Kanto earthquakes inferred from the ages of Holocene marine terraces revealed by a comprehensive drilling survey - ScienceDirectHistory of the great Kanto earthquakes inferred from the ages of Holocene marine terraces revealed by a comprehensive drilling survey - ScienceDirectHolocene marine terraces in Kanto, Japan, were remeasured using updated methods.History of the great Kanto earthquakes inferred from the ages of Holocene marine terraces revealed by a comprehensive drilling survey - ScienceDirectMost marine terraces were nearly a thousand years younger than previous measurements.History of the great Kanto earthquakes inferred from the ages of Holocene marine terraces revealed by a comprehensive drilling survey - ScienceDirectAn unrecognized terrace was identified on the basis of 0.5-m DEM and dating.History of the great Kanto earthquakes inferred from the ages of Holocene marine terraces revealed by a comprehensive drilling survey - ScienceDirectIntervals of Kanto earthquakes are presumably shorter than previous estimations.History of the great Kanto earthquakes inferred from the ages of Holocene marine terraces revealed by a comprehensive drilling survey - ScienceDirectWe measured the emergence ages of four marine terraces in the Chikura lowland, which lies to the southeast of the Boso Peninsula, in eastern Japan, to reevaluate the history of the great earthquake occurrences along the Sagami Trough over the past 10,000 years. The dates of the marine terraces are measured via radiocarbon dating of shell fossils obtained from the marine deposits. The sampling method employed in this study collects core samples using a dense and systematic drilling survey, which increased the reliability when correlating shell fossils with marine terraces. In addition, radiocarbon dating was performed with accelerator mass spectrometry, which produces more highly accurate measurements than those measured in previous studies. Moreover, we explored the surface profiles of the terraces with detailed digital elevation model (DEM) data obtained using LiDAR. The maximum emergence ages of the marine terraces were dated at 6300 cal yBP, 3000 cal yBP, and 2200 cal yBP from the top terrace excepting the lowest terrace (which was estimated at AD1703). In addition, another previously unrecognized terrace was detected between the highest and the second terrace in both the dating and the geomorphological analyses and was dated at 5800 cal yBP. The newly obtained ages are nearly a thousand of years younger than previously estimated ages; consequently, the intervals of the great earthquakes that occurred along the Sagami Trough are estimated to be much shorter and more varied than those of previous estimations. This result revises the data used in the current assessment of the probabilities of earthquakes along the Sagami Trough, which could devastate the Tokyo metropolitan area. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the current approach could be a powerful tool to increase the accuracy of assessments of the other areas with depositional marine terraces.Analysis of intermediate period correlations of coda from deep earthquakes - ScienceDirectAnalysis of intermediate period correlations of coda from deep earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe correlation properties of long period coda waves are studied.Analysis of intermediate period correlations of coda from deep earthquakes - ScienceDirectLong period coda correlation are contaminated by spurious arrivals.Analysis of intermediate period correlations of coda from deep earthquakes - ScienceDirectA new methodology to study and employ spurious arrivals is proposed.Analysis of intermediate period correlations of coda from deep earthquakes - ScienceDirectWe aim at assessing quantitatively the nature of the signals that appear in coda wave correlations at periods >20 s. These signals contain transient constituents with arrival times corresponding to deep seismic phases. These (body-wave) constituents can be used for imaging. To evaluate this approach, we calculate the autocorrelations of the vertical component seismograms for the Mw 8.4 sea of Okhotsk earthquake at 400 stations in the Eastern US, using data from 1 h before to 50 h after the earthquake. By using array analysis and modes identification, we discover the dominant role played by high quality factor normal modes in the emergence of strong coherent phases as ScS-like, and P'P'df-like. We then make use of geometrical quantization to derive the constituent rays associated with particular modes, and gain insights about the ballistic reverberation of the rays that contributes to the emergence of body waves. Our study indicates that the signals measured in the spatially averaged autocorrelations have a physical significance, but a direct interpretation of ScS-like and P'P'df-like is not trivial. Indeed, even a single simple measurement of long period late coda in a limited period band could provide valuable information on the deep structure by using the temporal information of its autocorrelation, a procedure that could be also useful for planetary exploration.Analysis of intermediate period correlations of coda from deep earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Real time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectReal time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectRegional aftershocks have a major impact on the drilling mud behavior.Real time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectMud gas variations are likely triggered by dynamic stress.Real time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectHigh hydraulic diffusivity and limited source inhibit the gas responses.Real time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectReal time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (356KB)Download full-size imageReal time drilling mud gas response to small-moderate earthquakes in Wenchuan earthquake Scientific Drilling Hole-1 in SW China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Deep postseismic viscoelastic relaxation excited by an intraslab normal fault earthquake in the Chile subduction zone - ScienceDirectDeep postseismic viscoelastic relaxation excited by an intraslab normal fault earthquake in the Chile subduction zone - ScienceDirectInSAR observed postseismic uplift and GPS recorded divergent motion following the 2005 intraslab Tarapaca earthquake.Deep postseismic viscoelastic relaxation excited by an intraslab normal fault earthquake in the Chile subduction zone - ScienceDirectDeep postseismic viscoelastic relaxation excited by an intraslab normal fault earthquake in the Chile subduction zone - ScienceDirectStatic stress from the Tarapaca earthquake may load positively on the M 6.7 foreshock before the M 8.2 Iquique earthquake.Deep postseismic viscoelastic relaxation excited by an intraslab normal fault earthquake in the Chile subduction zone - ScienceDirectDeep postseismic viscoelastic relaxation excited by an intraslab normal fault earthquake in the Chile subduction zone - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The relationship between PTSD, depression and negative life events: Ya'an earthquake three years later - ScienceDirectThe relationship between PTSD, depression and negative life events: Ya'an earthquake three years later - ScienceDirectPTSD and its sub-dimensions were positively related with negative life events and depression.The relationship between PTSD, depression and negative life events: Ya'an earthquake three years later - ScienceDirectNegative life events played a mediating role in the relationship between PTSD and depression.The relationship between PTSD, depression and negative life events: Ya'an earthquake three years later - ScienceDirectPTSD and depression was significantly positive.The relationship between PTSD, depression and negative life events: Ya'an earthquake three years later - ScienceDirectLongitudinal trajectories and predictors of anxiety symptoms among adolescent survivors exposed to Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectThis study aimed to investigate the developmental trajectories and associated predictors of anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents exposed to Wenchuan earthquake. 1573 adolescent survivors were followed up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-earthquake. Self-report measures were used to evaluate earthquake exposure, anxiety symptoms, negative life events, social support, and trait resilience. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) and multi-nominal logistic regression were used to analyze data. The results showed that 45.6%, 50.9%, 39.2%, and 39.9% of participants showed clinical levels of anxiety symptoms at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-earthquake, respectively. Four developmental trajectories were identified: resistance, recovery, delayed-onset anxiety, and chronic anxiety. Gender, injury of family members, negative life events, social support, and trait resilience were significant predictors for distinct anxiety trajectories. Individualized and appropriate psychosocial interventions should be provided for adolescents affected by natural disasters, especially those at higher risk for chronic or delayed mental problem symptoms.Longitudinal trajectories and predictors of anxiety symptoms among adolescent survivors exposed to Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake friction - ScienceDirectEarthquake friction - ScienceDirectEarthquake friction - ScienceDirectEarthquake friction - ScienceDirectEarthquake friction - ScienceDirectEnergy balance shows that thermal effects on interstitial fluids are crucial.Earthquake friction - ScienceDirectA four stage fault slip model is developed that can solve this friction paradox.Earthquake friction - ScienceDirectEarthquake friction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution - ScienceDirectA new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution - ScienceDirectThis paper reports a new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution.A new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution - ScienceDirectA new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution - ScienceDirectThe value d decreased with M.A new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution - ScienceDirectA new physical model for earthquake time interval distribution - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Receiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectReceiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectThis paper suggested the cause of the large Nobi earthquake (M8) in Japan.Receiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectThe geometry of the subducting Philippine Sea plate was revealed.Receiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectA clear image of the contact zone between continental crust and slab was obtained.Receiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectFaults of the earthquake are located above contact zone between crust and slab.Receiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectThe 28 October 1891 Nobi earthquake was one of the largest intraplate earthquakes in Japan, with an estimated magnitude of 8.0 determined by the Japan Meteorological Agency. It occurred in central Japan on the Eurasian Plate, beneath which the young Philippine Sea Plate is subducting. The geometry of this plate is not smooth; rather, beneath western Japan it appears distorted over a relatively short lateral distance. Beneath the Kinki region of central Japan, the subduction angle is approximately horizontal, and the Nobi earthquake occurred just above the horizontal section of the Philippine Sea slab. Temporary seismic stations were deployed in this area to investigate local seismic structure and its possible relationship to the cause of the earthquake. Crustal structure was investigated using receiver function analysis with a spatially dense temporary seismic network. A clear image of the subducted Philippine Sea slab was resolved, with ridge-like structures beneath the epicentral area of the Nobi earthquake. The ridge-like structure is in contact with the continental crust, and the fault plane of the Nobi earthquake is located at the edge of one such structure; i.e., in the contact area. The unique structure of the area is inferred to cause stress concentration and strain accumulation on local faults, which resulted in the large size of the Nobi earthquake.Receiver function images of the distorted Philippine Sea slab contact with the continental crust: Implications for generation of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Mj 8.0) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectDesign theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectA new type earthquake-resilient PSCWJ is put forward.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectThe mechanics mechanism and seismic design requirements of PSCWJ are introduced.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectThe design theory of an earthquake-resilient PSCWJ is established.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectThe rationality of the design theory of PSCWJ proposed in this study is verified.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectPSCWJ has good bearing behaviour, ductility, and earthquake resilience capacity.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectPrefabricated steel structure systems have become a new trend in the development of steel structures. In particular, earthquake-resilient steel structures have become a hot issue in the field of structural seismic research. Based on the idea of damage control and a new kind of energy-saving, material-saving and environmentally friendly sinusoidal corrugated web, this paper put forward a new type of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint (PSCWJ). Then, its constitution, its mechanics mechanism and its seismic design requirements are introduced. After considering the influence of the bolt binding coefficient, the overall bending of the binding section and the overall instability of the flange cover plate, the design theory of the earthquake-resilient PSCWJ is established. Through 55 examples of PSCWJs, the rationality of the design theory proposed in this study is verified, and a reasonable value range of the middle bolt interval on the flange cover plate is determined. During the process of theoretical derivation, the influences of many design parameters are considered, such as the section parameters of the sinusoidal corrugated web beam and cantilever beam, the thickness of the flange cover plate, the material properties of the flange cover plate, the diameter of bolts, the middle bolt interval and the weaken rate of the cover plate. Research shows that the design theory proposed in this paper can predict the yield load of PSCWJ accurately and effectively control the ultimate bearing capacity of PSCWJ. The PSCWJ designed through this theory has good bearing behaviour and ductility, which can make sure the main members, such as the beam and the column, remain in an elastic range and meet the requirements of earthquake resilience.Design theory of earthquake-resilient prefabricated sinusoidal corrugated web beam-column joint - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stochastic analysis model for vehicle-track coupled systems subject to earthquakes and track random irregularities - ScienceDirectThis paper devotes to develop a computational model for stochastic analysis and reliability assessment of vehicle-track systems subject to earthquakes and track random irregularities. In this model, the earthquake is expressed as non-stationary random process simulated by spectral representation and random function, and the track random irregularities with ergodic properties on amplitudes, wavelengths and probabilities are characterized by a track irregularity probabilistic model, and then the number theoretical method (NTM) is applied to effectively select representative samples of earthquakes and track random irregularities. Furthermore, a vehicle-track coupled model is presented to obtain the dynamic responses of vehicle-track systems due to the earthquakes and track random irregularities at time-domain, and the probability density evolution method (PDEM) is introduced to describe the evolutionary process of probability from excitation input to response output by assuming the vehicle-track system as a probabilistic conservative system, which lays the foundation on reliability assessment of vehicle-track systems. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by comparing to the results of Monte-Carlo method from statistical viewpoint. As an illustrative example, the random vibrations of a high-speed railway vehicle running on the track slabs excited by lateral seismic waves and track random irregularities are analyzed, from which some significant conclusions can be drawn, e.g., track irregularities will additionally promote the dynamic influence of earthquakes especially on maximum values and dispersion degree of responses; the characteristic frequencies or frequency ranges respectively governed by earthquakes and track random irregularities are greatly different, moreover, the lateral seismic waves will dominate or even change the characteristic frequencies of system responses of some lateral dynamic indices at low frequency.Stochastic analysis model for vehicle-track coupled systems subject to earthquakes and track random irregularities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Benefiting From Disaster? Public and Private Responses to the Wenchuan Earthquake - ScienceDirectWe provide the first household survey-based evidence on the impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake on the welfare of rural households. Asset and income losses were substantial, especially in seriously affected areas. Our main finding is that there was an overwhelming government response to the disaster. Subsidies provided to households in 2008 were so large that mean income per capita was 17.5% higher in 2008 than in 2007 and the poverty rate actually declined from 34% to 19%. Using distance from the epicenter as an instrument for earthquake damage, we find a strong positive statistical relationship between lost value of housing and other assets due to the earthquake and increases in income per capita and government transfers received, and much weaker responsiveness of private transfers, wage labor supply, and borrowing.Benefiting From Disaster?

To assess social vulnerability to earthquake disaster, this paper applied a rough set to construct an evaluation model of social vulnerability based on catastrophe progression. Following in-depth literature researches, an assessment model of social vulnerability to earthquake disaster in Sichuan Province, China, based on the catastrophe progression method was established. A rough set attribute reduction method was adopted to eliminate irrelevant social vulnerability indicators and optimize the proposed model. Finally, a catastrophe progression method for social vulnerability to earthquake disaster is developed to overcome the subjectivity of the index weight assignment of social vulnerability indicators in the currently used social vulnerability assessment method. The application of our method to Sichuan Province indicates large regional differences in terms of social vulnerability to earthquake disasters. The results show that the northeastern and central areas of Sichuan Province belong to the high social vulnerability category; in particular, Guangyuan is the most vulnerable region. These findings will provide policymakers with a scientific basis for their earthquake disaster risk management strategies.Social vulnerability assessment of earthquake disaster based on the catastrophe progression method: A Sichuan Province case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring indigenous perspectives of an environmental disaster: Culture and place as interrelated resources for remembrance of the 1960 mega-earthquake in Chile - ScienceDirectExploring indigenous perspectives of an environmental disaster: Culture and place as interrelated resources for remembrance of the 1960 mega-earthquake in Chile - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Performance of Earthquake-resistant RCC Frame Structures under Blast Explosions - ScienceDirectOver the years, due to rapid development and urbanization, coupled with relatively high average household income, cities like Abu Dhabi have transformed to a larger and advanced metropolis. Most of the medium to high-rise structures in these cities in the middle-east are designed to be earthquake resistant. Due to increase in accidental and intentional explosions, high-rise buildings can be exposed to those types of blast pressures. It is a real matter of concern for the designers to know how these earthquake resistant structures would perform when exposed to accidental blast loads. This research is aimed at exploring the structural behavior and performance of earthquake resistant reinforced concrete (RCC) frame structures under blast loading. For this study, typical reinforced concrete frame structures designed to be earthquake resistant according to International Building Code (IBC 2009) and ACI 318-11 provisions applicable for Abu Dhabi city were studied. Vulnerability of these structures were investigated under different realistic blast scenarios obtained by varying scaled distances and explosion charge-weights to study the structural response. Relative performance of RCC structures designed with and without consideration of earthquake load in load combinations is also presented. A major focus of this research was to establish specific distances beyond which a given blast would have minimal impact on a typical earthquake resistant concrete structure which can assist designers in choosing a safe standoff distance for a given load. Investigations on variation in performance by changing material properties and structural configurations were also included in this study.Performance of Earthquake-resistant RCC Frame Structures under Blast Explosions - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee iHBE 2016.Changes in In-Situ Rock Stress Before and After the Major 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake - ScienceDirectTo examine the change in in-situ stress between before and after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, we performed stress measurements after the earthquake in the Kamaishi mine, located near the northern termination of the mainshock rupture. The in-situ stress measurement period was from 1991 to 2016. The results showed that the magnitudes of the three-dimensional principal stresses and the vertical stress drastically increased during the mainshock and, at one year after the earthquake, were more than double those before the earthquake. The principal stress magnitudes then decreased with time, and returned almost to the pre-earthquake levels at about five years after the earthquake. The increasing and decreasing trends in stress in the Kamaishi mine can be interpreted in terms of the effects of coseismic rupture behavior of the Tohoku-oki earthquake mainshock and the occurrence of aftershocks in the Sanriku-oki low-seismicity region (SLSR), where the Kamaishi mine is located.Changes in In-Situ Rock Stress Before and After the Major 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of EUROCK 2017.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectA machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectA framework for assessing the post-earthquake structural safety of damaged buildings is presented.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectThe concepts of response and damage patterns are introduced and incorporated into a systematic methodology integrating probabilistic seismic demand analysis, component-level damage simulation and robust assessments of the residual collapse capacity.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectMachine learning algorithms are used to explicitly link the response and damage patterns to residual collapse capacity of a damaged structure, and are able to probabilistically predict the structural safety states given any available information.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectA series of predictive models including Classification and Regression Trees and Random Forests are developed and examined in detail to achieve the optimal model which balance multiple performance measurements.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectIn contrast to previously judgement-based methods for the tagging process, this innovative approach provides a solid statistical support for structural safety assessment.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectHigh prediction accuracies are observed based on either response and damage patterns.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectA machine learning framework is presented to assess post-earthquake structural safety. The concepts of response and damage patterns are introduced and incorporated into a systematic methodology for generating a robust dataset for any damaged building. Incremental dynamic analysis using sequential ground motions is used to evaluate the residual collapse capacity of the damaged structure. Machine learning algorithms are used to map response and damage patterns to the structural safety state (safe or unsafe to occupy) of the building based on an acceptable threshold of residual collapse capacity. Predictive models including classification and regression tree and Random Forests are used to probabilistically identify the structural safety state of an earthquake-damaged building. The proposed framework is applied to a 4-story reinforced concrete special moment frame building. Distinct yet partially overlapping response and damage patterns are found for the damaged building classified as safe and unsafe. High prediction accuracies of 91% and 88% are achieved when the safety state is assessed using response and damage patterns respectively. The proposed framework could be used to rapidly evaluate whether a damaged building remains structurally safe to occupy after a seismic event and can be implemented as a subroutine in community resilience evaluation or building lifecycle performance assessment and optimization.A machine learning framework for assessing post-earthquake structural safety - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Liquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectLiquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectThe shaking duration computed varies with distance to maximum crustal deformations.Liquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectLiquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectLiquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectIt is confirmed that tailings dams built using the upstream construction method are seismically unstable.Liquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectHigh seismic regions present stratified sandy soils, since liquefaction must have occurred in the past.Liquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectLiquefaction-induced ground damages during the 2010 Chile earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectSeismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectInterrelation between electrical resistivity, fluid & seismicity in collision zone.Seismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectGeophysical images of Main Himalayan Thrust and their linkages with Mw7.8 Nepal earthquakes.Seismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectRole of fluids dynamic in seismogenesis.Seismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectRole of transient stress transfer in triggering earthquakes.Seismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectThe April 25, 2015, Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake in central Nepal was followed by intense aftershock activity, including Mw6.7 shock on April 26, 2015 and Mw7.3 shock on May 12, 2015. Synthesis of the focal mechanisms, space-time distribution of seismic activity in relation to previously imaged crustal velocity and resistivity structures reveals focusing of the Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake near the upper surface of the thin fluid-filled low velocity and high conducting layer immediately above the plane of the detachment. On the geophysical sections, the detachment is identified as a sharp positive velocity interface. Modulation of frictional coupling and mechanical weakening by high-pore pressure fluids counteract the arc-normal stresses creating conditions for failure and nucleation of the Gorkha earthquakes on a plane sub-parallel with the detachment. Spatio-temporal patterns in aftershock activity indicate rapid alteration of main shock-induced stress fields, triggering a strong aftershock of Mw6.7. Large stress drop and increased energy released by the Mw6.7 event facilitates upward injection of high pore-pressure fluid fluxes into the hidden out-of-sequence thrust. It is suggested that decrease in shear strength along the hidden thrust plane due to the diffusion of high pore pressure fluids created conditions favourable to trigger Mw7.3 aftershock.Seismotectonics and seismogenesis of Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectA review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectThe rupture process of the 2011 Tohoku Mw 9.1 earthquake is reviewed.A review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic, geodetic, seafloor, tsunami, and drill hole information is considered.A review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectJoint inversions of various data now provide consistent models for coseismic slip.A review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectA review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectThe stress drop may have totally relaxed elastic shear stress in large slip areas.A review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectA review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectEarthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectCompiling reliable list of historical earthquake damage occurred in Israel and its close surroundings.Earthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectCharacterization of spatial and temporal damage patterns.Earthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectDetecting repeated damage in major cities and characterizing its severity.Earthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectIsrael was hit by destructive earthquakes many times in the course of history. To properly understand the hazard and support effective preparedness towards future earthquakes, we examined the spatial and temporal distribution of the resulted damage. We described in detail our systematic approach to searching the available literature, collecting the data and screening the authenticity of that information. We used GIS (Geographic Information System) to map and evaluate the distribution of the damage and to search for recurring patterns. Overall, it is found that 186 localities were hit, 54 of them at least twice. We also found that Israel was affected by 4, 17, 8 and 2 damaging earthquakes that originated, respectively, from the southern, central, central-northern and northern parts of the Dead Sea Transform (DST). The temporal appearance of the northern earthquakes is clustered; the central earthquakes are more regular in time, whereas no damage from the north-central and the central quakes, with the exception of the year 363 earthquake, seems to have occurred south of the Dead Sea region.Earthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectAnalyzing the distribution of the damage, we realized that the number of the damage reports reflects only half of the incidents that actually happened, attesting to incompleteness of the historical catalogue. Jerusalem is the most reported city with 14 entries, followed by Akko (Acre), Tiberias, Nablus and Tyre with 8, 7, 7 and 6 reports, respectively. In general, localities in the Galilee and north of it suffered more severely than localities in central Israel with the exception of Nablus and the localities along the coastal plain of Israel, most probably due to local site effects. For the sake of hazard management, these observations should be considered for future planning and risk mitigation.Earthquake damage history in Israel and its close surrounding - evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectCoseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectInSAR technology and S1A/IW data are used to study 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake.Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectCoseismic deformation field is derived from Sentinel-1A ascending and descending data.Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectCoseismic fault slip is inverted by using InSAR ascending, descending and GPS data.Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectWe provide some clues about seismic fault geometry different from geological results.Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectCoseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (212KB)Download full-size imageCoseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A statistical study of precursor activity in earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectA statistical study of precursor activity in earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multi-criteria location model of earthquake evacuation shelters to aid in urban planning - ScienceDirectEarthquakes are serious natural disasters that can result in significant fatalities and economic loss. The building of earthquake evacuation shelters is an effective way to reduce earthquake disaster risk and protect lives. Current studies on facility location models commonly overlook multiple optimal criteria from an urban planning perspective and are not suited to planning earthquake evacuation shelters. In this study, we describe seven principles for locating earthquake evacuation shelters. Following these principles, we propose a multi-criteria constraint location model that can be used to solve the location problem. We then present an iterative method to solve the model. With the support of a geographic information system (GIS), the method is composed of three steps: select candidate shelters, analyze the spatial coverage of candidate shelters and determine the shelter locations. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the application of the multi-criteria model and the corresponding solution method for its effectiveness in planning urban earthquake evacuation shelters. We conclude that the evacuation shelter location model and solution method are effective and suitable to solve the multi-criteria shelter location problem from an urban planning perspective.Multi-criteria location model of earthquake evacuation shelters to aid in urban planning - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Joint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectJoint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectA generalized ABIC formula without extra restrictions is derived.Joint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectThe rupture process was jointly inverted from three observations.Joint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectThe slip model likely does not overlap with the 1833 earthquake.Joint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectJoint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (364KB)Download full-size imageJoint inversion of GPS, InSAR and teleseismic data sets for the rupture process of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake using a generalized ABIC method - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectEffect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectWe examine fault failure of the 2011 Iwaki earthquake.Effect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectFault failure was strongly influenced by temporal change in the state of stress.Effect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectInland fault failure increased after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.Effect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectExcess fluid pressure is required to explain the 2011 Iwaki earthquake.Effect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectThe state of stress and excess fluid pressure induced activity on multiple faults.Effect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectEffect of a change in the state of stress on the likelihood of inland fault failure during the Mw 6.6 Iwaki earthquake resulting from the Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recent and future developments in earthquake ground motion estimation - ScienceDirectSeismic hazard analyses (SHA) are routinely carried out around the world to understand the hazard, and consequently the risk, posed by earthquake activity. Whether single scenario, deterministic analyses, or state-of-the art probabilistic approaches, considering all possible events, a founding pillar of SHA is the estimation of the ground-shaking field from potential future earthquakes. Early models accounted for simple observations, such that ground shaking from larger earthquakes is stronger and that ground motion tends to attenuate rapidly away from the earthquake source. The first ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) were, therefore, developed with as few as two principal predictor variables: magnitude and distance.Recent and future developments in earthquake ground motion estimation - ScienceDirectDespite the significant growth of computer power over the last few decades, and with it the possibility to compute kinematic or dynamic rupture models coupled with simulations of 3D wave propagation, the simple parametric GMPE has remained the tool of choice for hazard analysts. There are numerous reasons for this. First and foremost GMPEs are robust and reliable within the model space considered during their derivation, and many can be extrapolated to a degree beyond this space with some confidence. With ever expanding datasets and improved metadata the models are becoming more and more useful: a range of predictor variables are now used, describing the source, path and site effects in detail. GMPEs are also relatively easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. Despite this, probabilistic hazard calculations using GMPEs and accounting for uncertainties can still take several days to run. Full simulation-based approaches, therefore, clearly lie outside the computation budget afforded to most projects.Recent and future developments in earthquake ground motion estimation - ScienceDirectRecent and future developments in earthquake ground motion estimation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical seismo-ionospheric precursors of M7.0+ earthquakes in Circum-Pacific seismic belt by GPS TEC measurements - ScienceDirectStatistical seismo-ionospheric precursors of M7.0+ earthquakes in Circum-Pacific seismic belt by GPS TEC measurements - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rapid repair and replacement of earthquake-damaged concrete columns using plastic hinge relocation - ScienceDirectA rapid repair and replacement method is developed for earthquake-damaged concrete columns. Headed steel bars enclosed in a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) shell filled with non-shrink concrete are used to relocate the column plastic hinge. The method employs a steel collar with steel studs to increase bond of the column to non-shrink concrete within the CFRP shell. Two columns were damaged under quasi-static cyclic loads and were repaired with this method. The first column required epoxy injection of the cracks to restore stiffness; the second column was completely severed from the cap beam before repair to simulate replacement of a column with unrepairable damage. The plastic hinge was successfully relocated, the lateral force and displacement capacity were restored, and failure of the repaired columns included concrete crushing and steel bar fracture. This is an accelerated bridge construction method that could be used to repair columns with repairable damage as an emergency repair, replace columns with unrepairable damage, or construct new bridges.Rapid repair and replacement of earthquake-damaged concrete columns using plastic hinge relocation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Distribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectDistribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectDistribution of shallow VLFEs in eastern part of Nankai trough is estimated.Distribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectRecords of BBOBSs placed very close from the sources are analysed.Distribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectHieratical clustering analysis was introduced to assess the VLFE distribution.Distribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectThe VLFE distribution appear to be influenced by topography of subducting plate.Distribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectIt should be an important factor in assessing spatial patterns of tsunami generation.Distribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectDistribution of very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism influenced by a subducting-ridge - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A paleoseismic age model for large-magnitude earthquakes on fault segments of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust in the Central Seismic Gap of northern India - ScienceDirectCrustal collision between Eurasia and the Indian subcontinent has produced a thrust fault system that accommodates a share of the strain associated with convergence. The foremost of these faults is the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), also referred to as the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). Discrete segments of the HFT have produced numerous, large-magnitude earthquakes throughout the last two centuries that are constrained through instrumental and historical records. Paleoseismic studies have established comparable constraint for pre-instrumental ruptures of the fault. The segment of the fault known as the Central Seismic Gap (CSG), which extends from North-Central India into Western Nepal, is of particular interest due to an apparent long-term quiescence that suggests the potential for impending large-scale rupture. Here we compile recent, paleoseismological findings from seven published trench sites into a coherent OxCal age model for large-magnitude ruptures along the CSG. Our results indicate that the western half of the CSG likely ruptured in the event corresponding to historical accounts of an earthquake in 1344 CE.A paleoseismic age model for large-magnitude earthquakes on fault segments of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust in the Central Seismic Gap of northern India - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectDynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectEarthquake outdoor evacuation is simulated.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectImportance of each safety factor is assessed by Multiple-criteria decision method.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectSafety factor values are assessed according to a unique scale.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectFactors are combined by using the Dijkstra's algorithm to evaluate the best (safest) path.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectThe effectiveness of the guidance tool is tested through simulations.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectDynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectThis paper concerns a non-invasive solution for guiding people along probable safe evacuation routes in earthquake emergency. The proposed Seismic Pedestrians' Evacuation Dynamic Guidance Expert System (SpeedGuides) considers the influence of the main environmental and behavioural safety factors for evacuees (i.e. street vulnerability, street blockages probability, crowding conditions along paths, presence of mortal dangers, visibility conditions) and combines them in a safety index through the Multi-criteria techniques application. SpeedGuides dynamically collects safety factor data during the time and suggests the possible safest path to the nearest secure zone according to the Dijkstra's algorithm approach. SpeedGuides is an easy-to-use model proposed for application on personal devices (e.g. smartphone) that, taking advantage of different expert methods, allows evacuees to simple enhance their safety. A first effectiveness evaluation of SpeedGuides is provided through an earthquake pedestrians' evacuation simulator in a significant case study. The evacuee performances (with and without the proposed guidance tool) are compared and discussed. Results demonstrate how individuals' safety levels are increased when evacuees use SpeedGuides.Dynamic guidance tool for a safer earthquake pedestrian evacuation in urban systems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Correlation between elastic energy density and deep earthquakes distribution - ScienceDirectCorrelation between elastic energy density and deep earthquakes distribution - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Double-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectDouble-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectHigh-frequency waveform modeling reveals more focal mechanisms.Double-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectEarthquake depths are refined by broadband waveform modeling.Double-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectEarthquake horizontal location are refined by relative location.Double-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectRefined catalog shows a double-ramp geometry of the Main Himalaya Thrust.Double-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectThe ramps have probably played a significant role in stopping the rupture.Double-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectDouble-ramp on the Main Himalayan Thrust revealed by broadband waveform modeling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectSedimentary evidence of historical and prehistorical earthquakes along the Venta de Bravo Fault System, Acambay Graben (Central Mexico) - ScienceDirectSedimentary evidence of historical and prehistorical earthquakes along the Venta de Bravo Fault System, Acambay Graben (Central Mexico) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An improved data integration algorithm to constrain the 3D displacement field induced by fast deformation phenomena tested on the Napa Valley earthquake - ScienceDirectAn improved data integration algorithm to constrain the 3D displacement field induced by fast deformation phenomena tested on the Napa Valley earthquake - ScienceDirectA data integration algorithm for estimating the 3D displacement field due to natural or anthropic phenomena is proposed.An improved data integration algorithm to constrain the 3D displacement field induced by fast deformation phenomena tested on the Napa Valley earthquake - ScienceDirectThe algorithm works well with fast and sudden deformation phenomena.An improved data integration algorithm to constrain the 3D displacement field induced by fast deformation phenomena tested on the Napa Valley earthquake - ScienceDirectThe 3D displacement field induced by the 2014 Napa earthquake is estimated.An improved data integration algorithm to constrain the 3D displacement field induced by fast deformation phenomena tested on the Napa Valley earthquake - ScienceDirectIn this work, we propose an improved algorithm to constrain the 3D ground displacement field induced by fast surface deformations due to earthquakes or landslides. Based on the integration of different data, we estimate the three displacement components by solving a function minimization problem from the Bayes theory. We exploit the outcomes from SAR Interferometry (InSAR), Global Positioning System (GNSS) and Multiple Aperture Interferometry (MAI) to retrieve the 3D surface displacement field. Any other source of information can be added to the processing chain in a simple way, being the algorithm computationally efficient. Furthermore, we use the intensity Pixel Offset Tracking (POT) to locate the discontinuity produced on the surface by a sudden deformation phenomenon and then improve the GNSS data interpolation. This approach allows to be independent from other information such as in-situ investigations, tectonic studies or knowledge of the data covariance matrix. We applied such a method to investigate the ground deformation field related to the 2014 Mw 6.0 Napa Valley earthquake, occurred few kilometers from the San Andreas fault system.An improved data integration algorithm to constrain the 3D displacement field induced by fast deformation phenomena tested on the Napa Valley earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical simulation of earthquakes impact on facilities by grid-characteristic method - ScienceDirectQuantitative morphology of bedrock fault surfaces and identification of paleo-earthquakes - ScienceDirectQuantitative morphology of bedrock fault surfaces and identification of paleo-earthquakes - ScienceDirectQuantitative morphology of bedrock fault surfaces and identification of paleo-earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Learning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectLearning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectIn 2011, one of the severest earthquakes suffered by Spain took place in Lorca.Learning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectMost of the buildings in the city had reinforced concrete (RC) structures.Learning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectThis paper shows the lessons learnt from the Lorca earthquake.Learning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectAlmost all the damage sustained by RC structures took place in the columns.Learning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectLearning from RC building structures damaged by the earthquake in Lorca, Spain, in 2011 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evaluation of Reliability of the Earthquake Resistant Building Provided by Means of the Analysis for Design-Basis Earthquake - ScienceDirectThe paper analyzes the reliability level realized through the method recommended by SP 14.13330.2014 (Seismic Building Design Code).

The number of victims and their needs in emergency shelters change over the duration of the post-earthquake period, as evidenced by both actual earthquake records and theoretical analysis. To match the time-varying demand with the shelter planning, the hierarchical shelters that provide different level services should be projected. We first estimate the varying number of the victims in shelters during the post-earthquake period, and then model the locations for emergency shelters with a nested hierarchy, and also model the allocation of victims among shelters. Furthermore, we employ an efficient hybrid cross-entropy method to solve the location model and develop a better victim allocation scheme with a swap move to overcome the drawbacks of other allocation schemes. The empirical results from application to the Xuhui District in Shanghai of China show that emergency shelter planning based on a time-varying demand can reduce the construction cost of shelters and the averaged evacuation distance traveled by the victims, compared to the current policy based on the unvarying demand.Hierarchical earthquake shelter planning in urban areas: A case for Shanghai in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectFrictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectThe conditions for fault reactivation due to fluid overpressure are tested.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectFirst example of creep experiments on fault gouge under fluid overpressure.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectFault weakening by fluid overpressure overcome rate strengthening behavior.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectInform fault deformation with microstructural analysis.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectShort term fluid overpressure causes an energy unbalance that trigger dynamic slip.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectIt is widely recognized that the significant increase of M > 3.0 earthquakes in Western Canada and the Central United States is related to underground fluid injection. Following injection, fluid overpressure lubricates the fault and reduces the effective normal stress that holds the fault in place, promoting slip. Although, this basic physical mechanism for earthquake triggering and fault slip is well understood, there are many open questions related to induced seismicity. Models of earthquake nucleation based on rate- and state-friction predict that fluid overpressure should stabilize fault slip rather than trigger earthquakes. To address this controversy, we conducted laboratory creep experiments to monitor fault slip evolution at constant shear stress while the effective normal stress was systematically reduced via increasing fluid pressure. We sheared layers of carbonate-bearing fault gouge in a double direct shear configuration within a true-triaxial pressure vessel. We show that fault slip evolution is controlled by the stress state acting on the fault and that fluid pressurization can trigger dynamic instability even in cases of rate strengthening friction, which should favor aseismic creep. During fluid pressurization, when shear and effective normal stresses reach the failure condition, accelerated creep occurs in association with fault dilation; further pressurization leads to an exponential acceleration with fault compaction and slip localization. Our work indicates that fault weakening induced by fluid pressurization can overcome rate strengthening friction resulting in fast acceleration and earthquake slip. Our work points to modifications of the standard model for earthquake nucleation to account for the effect of fluid overpressure and to accurately predict the seismic risk associated with fluid injection.Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Occurrence probability assessment of earthquake-triggered landslides with Newmark displacement values and logistic regression: The Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectOccurrence probability assessment of earthquake-triggered landslides with Newmark displacement values and logistic regression: The Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectNeo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectThe procedure of NDSHA has been broadened so as to account for earthquake occurrence rate.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectThis scenario based procedure can naturally separate ground shaking from related occurrence rate.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectThe maps computed at fixed return period allow for a direct comparison between NDSHA and PSHA estimates.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectThe range of the expected acceleration values is much broader for NDSHA than for PSHA.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectThe PSHA values are lower than NDSHA in high seismicity areas and higher in low seismicity areas.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study is to associate the expected ground motions from Neo-Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment (NDSHA) to robust estimates of their long-term average occurrence rates.Neo-deterministic seismic hazard assessment and earthquake occurrence rate - ScienceDirectNDSHA means scenario-based methods for seismic hazard analysis, where realistic and duly validated synthetic time series, accounting for source, propagation, and site effects, are used to construct ground motion scenarios.

This vulnerability necessitates that Lebanese educational institutions play a proactive role in planning and preparing for future earthquakes. Students in various disciplines at Lebanese colleges (n=860) were surveyed to assess their preparedness for earthquakes and to determine how college programmes have affected students' preparedness level. The findings revealed a poor level of earthquake preparedness while multiple regression analysis showed that higher academic institutions have an insignificant contribution to the needed preparedness level of students.

Exposure and fragility models from the recently completed South America Risk Assessment (SARA) project were combined with conditioned ground motion fields from past events to calculate structural damage in the affected region. These results can facilitate the creation of risk reduction measures, such as retrofitting campaigns, development of insurance mechanisms and enhancement of building codes.

ScienceDirectSlope cutting and anchoring had less effect on the entire slope stability.Stability analysis of earthquake-induced rock slope based on back analysis of shear strength parameters of rock mass - ScienceDirectHigh-steep rock slopes are much more likely to collapse and form weir body due to earthquake. Converting the weir body to hydraulic engineering is a good way to deal with natural disasters. However, it is difficult to evaluate the stability of earthquake-induced rock slope due to the lack of shear strength parameters of rock mass. Based on three-dimension nonlinear finite elements, deformation reinforcement theory was adopted, in which plastic complementary is used to measure the global stability of slope, and unbalanced forces is utilized to identify the damage region. The shear strength parameters has been determined through back analysis based on stability and failure status before and after earthquake and monitoring data after earthquake. Then the stability evaluation under static conditions, dynamic conditions and rainfall conditions has been carried out respectively. The results show that failure mode of the slope under seismic load is consistent with the actual situation when the lowest material parameters are used. The major failure mode of the slope is sliding along the fault F5, and local collapse of the hanging body at the top of the slope under dynamic or rainfall load. The local stability can be improved effectively by excavating and taking bolt anchorages on the top of the slope.Stability analysis of earthquake-induced rock slope based on back analysis of shear strength parameters of rock mass - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectA plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectWe develop a 2000-year-long, seven-event earthquake record for the Alpine Fault.A plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectWe use a 27-event earthquake record to refine seismic hazard estimates.A plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectA plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectRegular earthquake recurrence is indicated by a coefficient of variation of 0.41.A plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectSediments in fault-adjacent wetlands provide high-resolution earthquake records.A plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectA plate boundary earthquake record from a wetland adjacent to the Alpine fault in New Zealand refines hazard estimates - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Liquefaction in western Sichuan Basin during the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectLiquefaction in western Sichuan Basin during the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectSystematic account of liquefaction and water ejection features during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.Liquefaction in western Sichuan Basin during the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectGeologic structures may have enhanced liquefaction in the Sichuan Basin.Liquefaction in western Sichuan Basin during the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectLiquefaction in western Sichuan Basin during the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectThe 3 Jan 2016, Tamenglong, India, intraslab earthquake occurred at a depth of 59 km on steep plane with strike slip motionSeismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectWe assessed the intensity of the earthquake from 460 locations.Seismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectHistorical records from the region document 332 earthquakes, out of which 1852, 1869 and 1880 were strong eventsSeismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismological, geodetic, macroseismic and historical context of the 2016 Mw 6.7 Tamenglong (Manipur) India earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The size, distribution, and mobility of landslides caused by the 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal - ScienceDirectThe size, distribution, and mobility of landslides caused by the 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal - ScienceDirectThis draft manuscript is distributed solely for purposes of scientific peer review.

However, current high-resolution simulation models involve uncertainties in their inputs. An alternative is to apply stochastic analyses using multicase simulations with varying inputs. In this study, we develop a method for simulating the responses of ground and buildings to many earthquakes. By a suitable map- ping of computations among computation cores, the developed program attains 97.4% size-up scalability using 320,000 processes (40,000 nodes) on the K computer. This enables the computation of more than 1,000 earthquake scenarios for 0.25 million structures in central Tokyo.Scalable Multicase Urban Earthquake Simulation Method for Stochastic Earthquake Disaster Estimation - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of ICCS 2015.Depth-dependence of post-seismic velocity changes in and near source area of the 2013 M7.0 Lushan earthquake revealed by S coda of repeating events - ScienceDirectDepth-dependence of post-seismic velocity changes in and near source area of the 2013 M7.0 Lushan earthquake revealed by S coda of repeating events - ScienceDirectRepeating events for monitoring postseismic velocity changes due to Lushan earthquake.Depth-dependence of post-seismic velocity changes in and near source area of the 2013 M7.0 Lushan earthquake revealed by S coda of repeating events - ScienceDirectDepth-dependence of post-seismic velocity changes in and near source area of the 2013 M7.0 Lushan earthquake revealed by S coda of repeating events - ScienceDirectHealing along the subsurface propagation paths partially explains velocity changes.Depth-dependence of post-seismic velocity changes in and near source area of the 2013 M7.0 Lushan earthquake revealed by S coda of repeating events - ScienceDirectDepth-dependence of post-seismic velocity changes in and near source area of the 2013 M7.0 Lushan earthquake revealed by S coda of repeating events - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An integrated analysis of source parameters, seismogenic structure, and seismic hazards related to the 2014 MS 6.3 Kangding earthquake, China - ScienceDirectAn integrated analysis of source parameters, seismogenic structure, and seismic hazards related to the 2014 MS 6.3 Kangding earthquake, China - ScienceDirectDiscrepancy between seismic and geodetic models was mainly due to low shear modulus at shallow depths and InSAR data noise.An integrated analysis of source parameters, seismogenic structure, and seismic hazards related to the 2014 MS 6.3 Kangding earthquake, China - ScienceDirectWeak afterslip may occur northwest of the epicenter.An integrated analysis of source parameters, seismogenic structure, and seismic hazards related to the 2014 MS 6.3 Kangding earthquake, China - ScienceDirectAn integrated analysis of source parameters, seismogenic structure, and seismic hazards related to the 2014 MS 6.3 Kangding earthquake, China - ScienceDirectAn integrated analysis of source parameters, seismogenic structure, and seismic hazards related to the 2014 MS 6.3 Kangding earthquake, China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigation on the Effect of Near-Fault Earthquake on Double Concave Friction Pendulum (DCFP) Base Isolated Buildings - ScienceDirectNear-fault earthquakes have different properties compared to far-fault earthquakes. Due to the phenomenon of forward directivity in near-fault earthquakes, the component perpendicular on fault has pulses with longer periods and wider range than the parallel component. Seismic isolators as the types of damping systems prevent structure to enter into non-linear range through their deformation. In this study, Single Degree of Freedom Structures (SDOFS), which are connected to FPS and DCFP isolators, was analyzed under time history implementing the records of near-fault and far-fault earthquakes. In addition, base shear, displacements, and acceleration incurred on the foundation of upper structure were examined. The obtained results indicated that in comparison with DCFP isolator, FPS isolator transfers less base shear on its structure in near-fault earthquake, whereas in comparison with FPS isolator, DCFP isolator transfers less displacements on its structure in near-fault earthquake. In addition, it transfers smaller acceleration on its foundation in near-fault and far-fault earthquakes.Ionospheric characteristics prior to the greatest earthquake in recorded history - ScienceDirectIonospheric characteristics prior to the greatest earthquake in recorded history - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ionospheric characteristics prior to the greatest earthquake in recorded history - ScienceDirectTel.: +56 42 2433629.Ionospheric characteristics prior to the greatest earthquake in recorded history - ScienceDirectTel.: +55 123 2087182.Ionospheric characteristics prior to the greatest earthquake in recorded history - ScienceDirectTel.: +56 41 2203153.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectEarthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectAn integrated method is presented to study seismic responses of building clusters.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectThe integral type of GZB constitutive equations with history variables is adopted.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectSurface topography of viscoelastic earth medium and fault rupture are considered.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectBuilding clusters are composed of plane frame structures.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectSeismic responses of building clusters in near-fault mountain city can be studied.Earthquake responses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city considering viscoelasticity of earth medium and process of fault rupture - ScienceDirectA new algorithm is proposed to implement viscoelastic wave propagation in earth medium with surface topography by introducing history variables into integral type GZB constitutive equations and by using the recursive formulae of these history variables. Combining the proposed algorithm with the flexural wave algorithm for frame structure and the algorithm for bidirectional wave propagation, a new type of integrated method is developed for earthquake response analyses of near-fault building clusters in mountain city due to rupture of causative fault. The earthquake responses of building clusters of frame structures situated at different sites of a mountain in Chongqing city, China, are studied during a hypothetical Mw 6.2 near-fault earthquake. The numerical results show that, for the multi-story buildings, the maximum peak value of beam-end bending moments appears in the building on the hill top and the earthquake risk positions are mainly at the bottom and/or the top of the buildings. For the high-rise buildings, the maximum peak value of beam-end bending moments appears in the building on the mountainside and the earthquake risk positions are mainly at the bottom and/or the middle of the buildings.Interior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectInterior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectSearch and rescue (SAR) operations in buildings after an earthquake must be quick.Interior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectA novel computational approach provides a building information model to aid SAR teams.Interior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectMany collapse candidate models are generated before the quake from an as-built BIM.Interior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectInterior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectFeasibility has been demonstrated using Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) algorithms.Interior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectInterior models of earthquake damaged buildings for search and rescue - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectStructural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectStructural performance during 2015 Gorkha earthquake is disseminated.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectStructural performance during past earthquakes in Nepal is outlined.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectComparative analysis of damages during major world earthquakes is discussed.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectLessons to be learned in the aftermath of Gorkha earthquake are formulated.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectCritical review of building regulations in Nepal is presented.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectGorkha earthquake (MW 7.8) occurred in Nepal on 25 April 2015 at 11:56 local time. This earthquake is the most devastating event after the 1934 great Bihar-Nepal earthquake (MW 8.1) in terms of damages. In that earthquake, 498,852 buildings were completely collapsed and other 256,697 were partially damaged. Structural and non-structural damages were occurred in all types of prevalent structural systems in affected areas. This paper outlines the structural performance during Turkey, Bhuj, Kashmir, Haiti, Chile and L'Aquila earthquakes from past two decades worldwide and comparisons are made in terms of structural forms, regulations to infer the lessons to be learnt by Nepal in the aftermath of Gorkha earthquake. Apart from this, review of structural performance during two major earthquakes of 1934 (MW 8.1) and 1988 (MW 6.5) in Nepal is presented to draw insights in terms of changing structural forms, technology and housing units. Insights are presented in terms of codal provisions and distribution of structures in Nepal. With due account of major world earthquake paradigms and historical earthquakes from Nepal and detailed field reconnaissance after the Gorkha earthquake, interpretations are disseminated in terms of lessons to be learned by Nepal in the aftermath of Gorkha earthquake. Comparative analyses have highlighted the urgent need of building code revision and development of proper strengthening techniques for the affected structures.Structural performance and associated lessons to be learned from world earthquakes in Nepal after 25 April 2015 (MW 7.8) Gorkha earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigation of ionospheric precursors related to deep and intermediate earthquakes based on spectral and statistical analysis - ScienceDirectInvestigation of ionospheric precursors related to deep and intermediate earthquakes based on spectral and statistical analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stress regimes in the northwest of Iran from stress inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms - ScienceDirectStress regimes in the northwest of Iran from stress inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Relevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectRelevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectThe region between great earthquakes investigated in view of Recent Nepal earthquakes.Relevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectRelevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectOn the basis of stress drop values the Central Seismic Gap (CSG) has been redefined.Relevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectRelevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectDue to the continuous movement of underthrusting Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate the strain energy accumulates, which is released substantially in the form of great earthquakes. It is yet to be released in the unruptured zone which lies between the two great earthquakes viz. 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake and 1905 Kangra earthquake. This zone has been termed as the Central Seismic Gap (CSG). The occurrence of previous great earthquakes and recent Nepal earthquakes, gives a clue to the probable location of future great earthquake. On the basis of analysis of seismicity in the locked portion and the stress drop analysis the CSG has been redefined and location of probable zone of future great earthquake has been demarcated.Relevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (255KB)Download full-size imageRelevance of seismicity in Kumaun-Garhwal Himalaya in context of recent 25th April 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Maternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectMaternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectWe assess the impact of maternal stress from a major earthquake on newborn health.Maternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectThe 1994 Northridge earthquake increased the likelihood of low birth weight.Maternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectImpacts on low birth weight were stronger for mothers more susceptible to stress.Maternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectMaternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectMaternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Maternal stress and birth outcomes: Evidence from the 1994 Northridge earthquake - ScienceDirectWe are grateful for comments and input from Christopher Carpenter, Paul Campbell Erwin, Scott Holladay, two anonymous referees, and seminar or conference participants at the University of Tennessee, TEAM-Fest, and the Midwestern Economics Association.

A traditional approach to model this discontinuity is to align the numerical mesh with the fault and solve the equations using finite elements. However, this distorted mesh can be difficult to generate and update. We present a new numerical method, inspired by the Immersed Interface Method (Leveque and Li, 1994), for solving the elastostatic equations with embedded discontinuities. This method has been carefully designed so that it can be used on parallel machines on an adapted finite difference grid. We have implemented this method in Gamra, a new code for earth modeling. We demonstrate the correctness of the method with analytic tests, and we demonstrate its practical performance by solving a realistic earthquake model to extremely high precision.The 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectSlip confined in one asperity located NW of the epicentre, with sparse aftershocksThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectRupture directivity towards NWThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectMost aftershocks off-fault, evidence for activation of other faultsThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectDamage pattern at Vrisa due to directivity, near-field effects and local geologyThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectThe 12 June 2017 Mw 6.3 Lesvos Island (Aegean Sea) earthquake: Slip model and directivity estimated with finite-fault inversion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A finite difference method for off-fault plasticity throughout the earthquake cycle - ScienceDirectA finite difference method for off-fault plasticity throughout the earthquake cycle - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Safety analysis of nuclear containment vessels subjected to strong earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis - ScienceDirectVery short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectVery short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectProminent anomalous GPS signals were observed a few minutes before the occurrence of earthquakes.Very short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectGPS phase has been greatly disturbed before the earthquakes.Very short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe source of disturbance emits from the seismogenic region.Very short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe anomalous GPS signal is caused by the interference between the GPS phase and EM.Very short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectThe anomalous GPS signals observed in this study can act as earthquake precursor.Very short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectVery short-term earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes, Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of Existing Masonry Heritage Building Subjected to Earthquake Loading - ScienceDirectIn the present study, the finite element analysis has been carried out on masonry building subjected to earthquake loading. For this purpose, an existing masonry heritage building situated in Aligarh city has been chosen. The time history method using El-Centro earthquake data has been employed for seismic performance of the chosen building. The maximum principal tensile stress and maximum shear stress has been observed and compared with permissible stresses. It has been found that these stresses exceed the permissible limit at few locations such as dome-wall junction, wall-roof junctions and the minarets. It has also been found that these locations are the most critical portion of the building under earthquake forces.Analysis of Existing Masonry Heritage Building Subjected to Earthquake Loading - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of Implast 2016.An enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectAn enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectDetailed source analysis of a Mw 4.7 earthquake in central Wyoming.An enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectA rare example of an earthquake occurring in the continental lithospheric mantle.An enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectAn enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectWaveform similarity suggests the only aftershock occurred at a similar depth.An enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectAn enigmatic earthquake in the continental mantle lithosphere of stable North America - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Biomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectBiomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectWe report biomarker responses of mussels subjected to earthquake disturbances.Biomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectMetal concentrations were higher in the digestive gland and the gill than the foot and the mantle.Biomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectPost-earthquake metal levels in the tissues were similar to pre-earthquake values.Biomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectScope for growth was negative post-earthquake for all three sites.Biomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectBiomarkers were effective at detecting the effects of multiple stressors.Biomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectBiomarker responses of mussels exposed to earthquake disturbances - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Strength demands of tall wind turbines subject to earthquakes and wind load - ScienceDirectWind and earthquake load have historically been conceived to act independently. However, if we reflect on the fact that major seismic events are usually followed by a number of aftershocks and that wind is constantly flowing at high intensities around wind farms, which induces additional demands of resistance to infrastructure, then the joint probability of middle-to strong earthquakes and low-to mild wind events becomes more relevant. In this paper a generalised approach is used to estimate the ratio between earthquake and wind forces and their effect on infrastructure. Following, a probabilistic analysis is carried out to show that under certain conditions the combination of these natural events can induce additional demands of strength and ductility to wind turbines which could lead to unforeseen damage.Earthquake Folklore and Legends - ScienceDirectEarthquake Folklore and Legends - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake Folklore and Legends - ScienceDirectSafety Aspects of Sustainable Storage Dams and Earthquake Safety of Existing Dams - ScienceDirectCoastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectCoastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectCoastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectNew model generated for coastal erosion and recovery following an earthquake and tsunamiCoastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectCoastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectThis tsunami removed more sand from beaches than historical El Ninos.Coastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectCoastal erosion and recovery from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectPrompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectPrompt identification of regional tsunamigenic earthquake is proposed.Prompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectThe technique utilizes single 3-component seismic record for identification.Prompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectArtificial neural network is used for nonlinear inverse mapping.Prompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectThe technique is validated by estimating focal parameters of the earthquake.Prompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectThe technique is expected to be very effective in poorly instrumented regions.Prompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectPrompt identification of tsunamigenic earthquakes from 3-component seismic data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Geological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectGeological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectPaleoseismology along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) of Nepal.Geological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectPast and Future Great Earthquakes in vicinity of 2015 Gorkha earthquake.Geological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectStrain accumulation cycle on HFT leading to great earthquake near Kathmandu.Geological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectFault Displacement may record historically reported 1255 AD earthquake.Geological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectGeological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectGeological observations on large earthquakes along the Himalayan frontal fault near Kathmandu, Nepal - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical analysis of the ionospheric ion density recorded by DEMETER in the epicenter areas of earthquakes as well as in their magnetically conjugate point areas - ScienceDirectStatistical analysis of the ionospheric ion density recorded by DEMETER in the epicenter areas of earthquakes as well as in their magnetically conjugate point areas - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Do buried-rupture earthquakes trigger less landslides than surface-rupture earthquakes for reverse faults?

To define the fault that generated the 2013 earthquake and its relationship with the Beichuan fault, which ruptured in the Wenchuan earthquake, we construct several cross sections and a 3D structural model. The sections and models reveal that the main-shock of the Lushan earthquake occurred on a portion of the Range Front blind thrust (RFBT) and that the structural geometry of this fault varies along strike. The Lushan main-shock occurred at a location along the strike of the fault where the geologic shortening and total fault slip are greatest. A lateral ramp of the RFBT appears to coincide with the northern limit of aftershocks from the Lushan earthquake, leading to a 75 km seismic gap between the Wenchuan earthquake and the 2013 earthquake sequence. Although both the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes occurred within the Longmen Shan fold-and-thrust belt, different faults generated the two events. Based on this structural characterization and analysis of the aftershocks of the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes, we suggest that the Lushan earthquake may have been triggered by the 2008 rupture but is best considered as an independent event rather than an aftershock of the Wenchuan earthquake. The RFBT that generated the Lushan earthquake is linked to a detachment that extends into the Sichuan basin along the Triassic evaporite layer. The coulomb stress change simulation suggests that other faults linked to this detachment may have been loaded by the 2008 and 2013 earthquake, posing the risk of future earthquakes along the Longmen Shan and in the densely populated Sichuan basin.Structural geometry of the source region for the 2013 Mw 6.6 Lushan earthquake: Implication for earthquake hazard assessment along the Longmen Shan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectVariation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectIntroduced the concept of singularity into earthquake frequency-size distribution.Variation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectIntroduced a new form of GR which associates the b-value and singularity index.Variation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectNew interpretation of b-value or singularity including their range properties.Variation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectVariation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectNew finding of increase of singularity of earthquakes with respect to locations.Variation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectVariation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (330KB)Download full-size imageVariation of singularity of earthquake-size distribution with respect to tectonic regime - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing).Earthquake-Related Inscriptions - ScienceDirectEarthquake-Related Inscriptions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake-Related Inscriptions - ScienceDirectScenario-based earthquake risk assessment for Bucharest, Romania - ScienceDirectIn this study, a seismic risk analysis for Bucharest (Romania) is performed using six intermediate-depth Vrancea earthquake scenarios, defined as a function of magnitude, focal depth and source-to-site distance.

Subsequently, for each individual earthquake scenario, an estimation of the damage, losses and casualties is obtained. Moreover, a community resilience metrics, defined in terms of recovery of the housing capacity is evaluated using a model available in the literature.

ScienceDirectEarthquake early warning (EEW) has been implemented in several regions around the world. However, because of natural randomness and uncertainty, false alarm and missed alarm can be expected in EEW. The key scope of this study is to evaluate the reliability of an on-site EEW in Taiwan, by testing the system's algorithm with 17,836 earthquake data from 1999 to 2013. The analysis shows that the on-site EEW system, empirically speaking, should have a false-alarm probability of 2.5%, and a missed-alarm probability of 14.1%. Considering missed alarm should be more critical to EEW, a new algorithm that could reduce the system's missed-alarm occurrences to 6% is also discussed in this paper.Reliability assessment on earthquake early warning: A case study from Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China: Constraining fault geometry and investigating a detailed spatial distribution of afterslip - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China: Constraining fault geometry and investigating a detailed spatial distribution of afterslip - ScienceDirectOptimal fault geometry of the Wenchuan earthquak is a listric fault connecting a shallowing sub-horizontal detachment.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China: Constraining fault geometry and investigating a detailed spatial distribution of afterslip - ScienceDirectLocal coseismic dynamic overshoot activated reversed aftershock activities and afterslip behaviours.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China: Constraining fault geometry and investigating a detailed spatial distribution of afterslip - ScienceDirectReversed afterslip may be a significant factor resulting in decreased CFS change at the hypocentre of the Lushan earthquake.Postseismic deformation associated with the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China: Constraining fault geometry and investigating a detailed spatial distribution of afterslip - ScienceDirectPostseismic deformation associated with the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China: Constraining fault geometry and investigating a detailed spatial distribution of afterslip - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Damage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectDamage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectWe present failure modes observed in RC precast structures during field reports after the 2012 Emilia Earthquake.Damage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectWe identify and discuss the most frequent causes of collapse.Damage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectWe present previously undocumented collapses.Damage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectThe present paper presents a complete and commented collection of cases of damage and collapse in reinforced concrete (RC) precast industrial buildings, observed by the authors during a series of field surveys after the 2012 Emilia earthquake in Northern Italy. They were selected among a total of about 2000 industrial RC precast buildings, whose structural characteristics and damage have been collected in a large database by the authors.Damage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectThe main causes of the collapses were vulnerabilities related to the structural characteristics of Italian precast buildings not designed with seismic criteria. In particular, these structures were typically built as an assembly of monolithic elements (roof elements, main and secondary beams, columns) in statically determinate configurations. The most common failure causes identified were: the absence of mechanical connectors between precast monolithic elements, the interaction of structural elements with non-structural walls, the insufficient column bending capacity, the rotation of pocket foundations, the inadequacy of connections of external precast cladding walls to bearing elements (columns and beams), the overturning of racks in buildings used as warehouses or in automated storage facilities.Damage and collapses in industrial precast buildings after the 2012 Emilia earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Commensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectCommensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectCommensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectThe expanding commensurable theory reveals the time law of the occurrence of events in a specified space region.Commensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectThe studied results show that the earthquakes basically all occur at the commensurable point of its time axis, respectively.Commensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectThe commensurability can provide a scientific basis for the prediction of earthquakes.Commensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectCommensurability of earthquake occurrence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Numerical earthquake models of the 2013 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake series: Characteristics of source rupture processes, strong ground motions and their tectonic implication - ScienceDirectNumerical earthquake models of the 2013 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake series: Characteristics of source rupture processes, strong ground motions and their tectonic implication - ScienceDirectNumerical earthquake model includes source rupture and 3-D wave propagation.Numerical earthquake models of the 2013 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake series: Characteristics of source rupture processes, strong ground motions and their tectonic implication - ScienceDirectNantou earthquake series could occur on the easternmost edge of a strong basement.Numerical earthquake models of the 2013 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake series: Characteristics of source rupture processes, strong ground motions and their tectonic implication - ScienceDirectMid-crust events in central Taiwan should be considered for hazard assessment.Numerical earthquake models of the 2013 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake series: Characteristics of source rupture processes, strong ground motions and their tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHospital Employee Willingness to Work during Earthquakes Versus Pandemics - ScienceDirectResearch indicates that licensed health care workers are less willing to work during a pandemic and that the willingness of nonlicensed staff to work has had limited assessment.Hospital Employee Willingness to Work during Earthquakes Versus Pandemics - ScienceDirectWe sought to assess and compare the willingness to work in all hospital workers during pandemics and earthquakes.Hospital Employee Willingness to Work during Earthquakes Versus Pandemics - ScienceDirectAn online survey was distributed to Missouri hospital employees.

Environmental migrants, identified as official migrants who moved to other municipalities after the impact of the natural hazard, are separated from displaced persons living in the temporary housing using the Japanese Residence Registration System. Firstly, the impact of the disaster on migration is estimated using an interrupted time series analysis. Subsequently, migration estimates are regressed using municipality-level data on the impact of the disaster and social vulnerability indicators. In addition, three counterfactuals were created where migration in the absence of the disaster was estimated using different forecasting methods. The results reveal that there appeared to be a significant increase in out-migration by up to 33.3% attributable to the earthquake and tsunami disaster. Moreover, estimates indicate that municipalities with lower financial strength, higher incomes, and smaller shares of part-time farmers, or primary labor workers, were more likely to produce more environmental migrants following a disaster. The findings provide empirical evidence linking environmental migration with certain social vulnerability indicators which contribute to better understanding the nature of migration following a natural disaster.Social vulnerability and environmental migration: The case of Miyagi Prefecture after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evaluating the Effect of Strong Earthquake on Slope Instability - ScienceDirectIn this paper, the effect of strong earthquakes on slope instability has been evaluated in the range of dam reservoir Zirdan (North of Chabahar) in Iran. For this propose, the information of tectonical position, stratigraphy, structural features, seismicity and instability potential of the province of Makran have been studied. The research methodology of the analysis is based on Rock P software and Morgestron-Price stability method. The required data has been obtained and summarized through field research and experimental results. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method has been used for investigation. Then, annual risk of earthquakes has been considered by stochastic model. Further, Soft Bounds Model has been utilized for determining the seismic event magnitude in the radius of 100 Km in the dam site. Afterwards the return period seismic event was calculated by HZ2 software. The stability analysis of dam reservoir slopes has been carried out by slide software. Moreover, slopes were analyzed in saturation and seismic conditions. The analysis indicates that reservoir slopes of the Zirdan Dam are unstable under severe seismic loads. Necessary slope stability measures are recommended based on the results.Evaluating the Effect of Strong Earthquake on Slope Instability - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of Implast 2016.Canterbury earthquake construction and demolition waste management: issues and improvement suggestions - ScienceDirectCanterbury earthquake construction and demolition waste management: issues and improvement suggestions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Far-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectFar-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectWe model the generation of infrasound in the far wave zone of Tohoku earthquake.Far-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectFar-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectThe calculated ionospheric disturbances coincide with the experimental results.Far-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectFar-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectFar-field coseismic ionospheric disturbances of Tohoku earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Innovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectInnovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectInnovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectInnovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectSix zones analyzed: California, Central USA, North East, Hawaii, Turkey, Japan.Innovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectResults show, there is an identifiable pattern in random earthquake occurrences.Innovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectThis mathematical model can be used to predict future earthquake occurrences.Innovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectInnovative Mathematical Model for Earthquake Prediction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectSeismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectExperimental results from shaking table tests on a 1/12 scaled high-speed railway bridge.Seismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectValidated finite element modelling for the actual high-speed railway bridge.Seismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectInvestigated of seismic performance and damage evaluation of various bridge components.Seismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectValuable results for safety assessment of high speed trains passing through the bridge.Seismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectSeismic damage evaluation of high-speed railway bridge components under different intensities of earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A review of retrospective stress-forecasts of earthquakes and eruptions - ScienceDirectA review of retrospective stress-forecasts of earthquakes and eruptions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz: Is there a link between micro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults?

The most-commonly used remote sensing techniques in geotechnical engineering (satellite imagery and LIDAR), as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), are introduced and recent case histories of the use of these techniques in reconnaissance efforts are provided. These examples demonstrate the potential for remote sensing to improve our understanding of geotechnical effects both at a regional scale and at a local level. The use of remote sensing to measure ground movements is particularly noteworthy and has the potential to provide data sets that will improve our ability to quantitatively predict the consequences of liquefaction and landslides. However, to realize this potential, investments must be made in collecting appropriate pre-earthquake data.Remote sensing for geotechnical earthquake reconnaissance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectPsychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectThe Great East Japan Earthquake increased psychological distress (PD) of survivors.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectThe prevalence of disability among the elderly increased after the earthquake.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectNo study examined the association between PD and incident disability after disaster.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectPD was significantly associated with incident disability.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectThis study suggests chronic effects of PD after disaster.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectWe conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate whether psychological distress would have increased the incident risk of functional disability after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectPsychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectPsychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectWe did not consider all potential confounders and use of appropriate medication.Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake - ScienceDirectThe present study has demonstrated that psychological distress was associated with an increased risk of functional disability among elderly survivors of a natural disaster.Underground pipeline response to earthquake-induced ground deformation - ScienceDirectThe principal causes of earthquake-induced ground deformation are identified and their interaction with underground infrastructure, primarily pipelines and conduits, is described. The coupled forces normal and parallel to underground pipelines arising from earthquake-induced ground movement are evaluated, including a review of measured stresses on pipe surfaces during large-scale testing, evaluation of frictional forces related to soil-pipe interaction, and the resolution of interaction forces along and across pipelines. Methods for characterizing soil reaction to pipe lateral and vertical movements are presented. The maximum downward pipe force is only about one-third the maximum force determined with conventional bearing capacity equations, thus requiring changes in current analytical and design practice. The analytical results for pipeline response to strike-slip and normal fault rupture are shown to compare favorably with the results of both large-scale and centrifuge tests of soil-pipeline interaction simulating these types of severe ground deformation.Underground pipeline response to earthquake-induced ground deformation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectFault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectThe pressure gradient at the brittle-ductile transition controls the seismic cycle.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectLow strain rate areas along active faults release the larger earthquakes.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectGPS data primarily record shearing in the ductile lower crust.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectEarthquake energy delivered by normal faults is mostly gravitational.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectEarthquake energy delivered by thrust and strike-slip faults is mostly elastic.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectWe propose that the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) controls the seismic cycle. In particular, the movements detected by space geodesy record the steady state deformation in the ductile lower crust, whereas the stick-slip behavior of the brittle upper crust is constrained by its larger friction. GPS data allow analyzing the strain rate along active plate boundaries. In all tectonic settings, we propose that earthquakes primarily occur along active fault segments characterized by relative minima of strain rate, segments which are locked or slowly creeping. We discuss regional examples where large earthquakes happened in areas of relative low strain rate. Regardless the tectonic style, the interseismic stress and strain pattern inverts during the coseismic stage. Where a dilated band formed during the interseismic stage, this will be shortened at the coseismic stage, and vice-versa what was previously shortened, it will be dilated. The interseismic energy accumulation and the coseismic expenditure rather depend on the tectonic setting (extensional, contractional, or strike-slip). The gravitational potential energy dominates along normal faults, whereas the elastic energy prevails for thrust earthquakes and performs work against the gravity force. The energy budget in strike-slip tectonic setting is also primarily due elastic energy. Therefore, precursors may be different as a function of the tectonic setting. In this model, with a given displacement, the magnitude of an earthquake results from the coseismic slip of the deformed volume above the BDT rather than only on the fault length, and it also depends on the fault kinematics.Fault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageFault on-off versus strain rate and earthquakes energy - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of China University of Geosciences (Beijing)Reconstructed seismic and tsunami scenarios of the 1905 Calabria earthquake (SE Tyrrhenian sea) as a tool for geohazard assessment - ScienceDirectReconstructed seismic and tsunami scenarios of the 1905 Calabria earthquake (SE Tyrrhenian sea) as a tool for geohazard assessment - ScienceDirectSant'Eufemia fault is a plausible source of the Calabria 1905 earthquake/tsunami.Reconstructed seismic and tsunami scenarios of the 1905 Calabria earthquake (SE Tyrrhenian sea) as a tool for geohazard assessment - ScienceDirectSimulation of tsunami inundation produced by a M6.9, 1905-type earthquake.Reconstructed seismic and tsunami scenarios of the 1905 Calabria earthquake (SE Tyrrhenian sea) as a tool for geohazard assessment - ScienceDirectKF estimated intensities distribution determined by a M6.9, 1905-type earthquake.Reconstructed seismic and tsunami scenarios of the 1905 Calabria earthquake (SE Tyrrhenian sea) as a tool for geohazard assessment - ScienceDirectReconstructed seismic and tsunami scenarios of the 1905 Calabria earthquake (SE Tyrrhenian sea) as a tool for geohazard assessment - ScienceDirectItaly is one of the most seismically active regions in the central Mediterranean and one of the countries with the longest record of historical earthquakes in the world.

Ductile deformation in the shear zone leads to weakening of the rock due to grain size reduction and shear heating. Due to this weakening, the rheological contrasts between the shear zone and the surrounding rock are increased and the critical stress required to initiate thermal runaway is progressively decreased until the rock fails by self-localizing thermal runaway. However, dislocation accommodated grain boundary sliding reduces the temperatures at which this process is feasible, as it weakens the rock to such an extent that critical runaway stresses are never reached.Grain size assisted thermal runaway as a nucleation mechanism for continental mantle earthquakes: Impact of complex rheologies - ScienceDirectApplication of these numerical models to the 2013 Wind River earthquake (Wyoming) suggests that grain size assisted thermal runaway is a feasible mechanism for the nucleation of this earthquake.Grain size assisted thermal runaway as a nucleation mechanism for continental mantle earthquakes: Impact of complex rheologies - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Small size very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism, following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake - ScienceDirectSmall size very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism, following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake - ScienceDirectMany very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) occurred in the Nankai trough, following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake.Small size very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism, following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake - ScienceDirectThe close-in observations, using broadband ocean bottom seismometers, show that they have an anomalously long source duration compared to ordinal earthquakes.Small size very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism, following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake - ScienceDirectThe newly detected VLFEs are smaller in size and have shallower source depths compared to previously reported ones.Small size very low frequency earthquakes in the Nankai accretionary prism, following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake - ScienceDirectVLFEs are not a unique phenomenon in the decollement zone.

More recently, the classical astronometric observations of the polar motion have been replaced by very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations with an improvement in accuracy by a factor of several thousand. We analyze the record of nearly 29 years of VLBI polar motion observations from the Goddard Space Flight Center.Modern observations of the effect of earthquakes on the Chandler wobble - ScienceDirectIn addition to the Chandler wobble, the polar motion has annual components making the analysis more difficult. The present study extends the polar motion sequence in both directions by the maximum entropy method (MEM). This allows the annual components, both the prograde motion and a weaker retrograde motion, to be identified and removed, leaving a pure Chandler wobble and secular polar shift. In the absence of excitation, the free Chandler wobble is closely a prograde circular motion. Circular arcs are fitted to the pole path, free of the annual components, to determine breaks corresponding to sudden excitations. The event times of earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 7.5 are shown on the plotted pole paths. Often, the effects on the pole path precede the earthquake by many days, confirming the establishment of the far-field displacements in advance of the earthquake. The precursory rise in P-wave attenuation before the 2004 Parkfield earthquake, as discovered by Chun et al. (2010), may indicate a similar effect from local deformations.Modern observations of the effect of earthquakes on the Chandler wobble - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectThe 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectStress regime and focal mechanism solution determined for Mw 4.4 Jizan EarthquakeThe 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectResults point toward dextral strike slip fault trending in the ENE-WSW direction.The 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectIt indicates reactivation of pre-existing faults buried in the Pre-Cambrian basement.The 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectActive fault is conjugate to Red Sea spreading axis and NNW-SSE Najd fault system.The 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectThe 23 January 2014 Jizan earthquake and its tectonic implications in southwestern Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of spatially varying earthquake impacts on mood and anxiety symptom treatments among long-term Christchurch residents following the 2010/11 Canterbury earthquakes, New Zealand - ScienceDirectThis study investigates the effects of disruptions to different community environments, community resilience and cumulated felt earthquake intensities on yearly mood and anxiety symptom treatments from the New Zealand Ministry of Health's administrative databases between September 2009 and August 2012.

This is typically in the form of a blanket of coarse gravel or cobbles surrounding the structure. These coarse particles are selected for their high resistance to being displaced by strong currents and thus protect the underlying finer sand particles from scour. However, in the event of an earthquake, the foundation sand may be susceptible to some degree of liquefaction. This research investigates the effects of seismic-induced liquefaction over a scour blanket, and if sinking is inhibited by some combination of the additional effective stress imposed by the gravel together with the interlocking resistance that develops when coarse particles are subjected to relative displacements.Stability of scour protection due to earthquake-induced liquefaction: Centrifuge modelling - ScienceDirectIn order to evaluate the stability of scour protection blankets, a programme of physical modelling was carried out, involving the assessment of different configurations of stone layers over a liquefiable material, and a monopile-type foundation. Models were subjected to scaled base shaking equivalent to earthquake loading. A mass-balance of particle sinkage showed that a filter layer was critical for maintaining the integrity of the armour stones. Based on displacement and pore water pressure measurements, it was found that the presence of the scour protection blankets improved the response of the liquefiable sand under seismic loading, and even inhibited the occurrence of liquefaction. This implies that a well-designed scour protection blanket can assist in protecting against earthquake effects also.Stability of scour protection due to earthquake-induced liquefaction: Centrifuge modelling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stability of scour protection due to earthquake-induced liquefaction: Centrifuge modelling - ScienceDirectFormerly University of Dundee, UK.Satellite observation of CH4 and CO anomalies associated with the Wenchuan MS 8.0 and Lushan MS 7.0 earthquakes in China - ScienceDirectSatellite observation of CH4 and CO anomalies associated with the Wenchuan MS 8.0 and Lushan MS 7.0 earthquakes in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectDDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectLong run-out landslides induced by earthquake were studied.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectThe MAM was extended by introducing the movement change.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectThe latest DDA was used to verify the MAM.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectA conceptual landslide and the Donghekou landslide were simulated in DDA.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectThis paper studies the run-out of earthquake-induced landslides. There are more than 20 mechanical models to explain long run-out of rapid landslides including some earthquake-induced landslides. However, notably few of them considered the effect of seismic loading on the run-out of landslides. In a previous study, we have proposed a model, which is called the multiplex acceleration model (MAM), to interpret the long run-out mechanism, and a shaking-table test has been performed to verify the MAM. Because the previous MAM is a conceptual model and only a single stone has been examined under sine waves by the shaking-table test, the MAM needs to be extended and further verified.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectIn this paper, the MAM was extended by introducing the movement change that was induced by the so-called trampoline effect of earthquake loading, and the latest practical numerical simulation program, discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA), was used to verify the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides. After a conceptual landslide model was used to verify the effect of seismic loading on the mobility, the Donghekou landslide, which was a typical long run-out landslide that was induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, was analyzed. The results show that: the seismic loading could be one of the factors that could eventually help increase the run-out of landslides.DDA validation of the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Role of geological structure in the occurrence of earthquake-induced landslides, the case of the 2007 Mid-Niigata Offshore Earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectRole of geological structure in the occurrence of earthquake-induced landslides, the case of the 2007 Mid-Niigata Offshore Earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectField observations to Mid-Niigata Offshore earthquake triggered landslides.Role of geological structure in the occurrence of earthquake-induced landslides, the case of the 2007 Mid-Niigata Offshore Earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectBedding plane acts significant role in landsliding on cataclinal slope during strong earthquake.Role of geological structure in the occurrence of earthquake-induced landslides, the case of the 2007 Mid-Niigata Offshore Earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectNon-tectonic structures controlling landslide on the orthogonal slope during earthquake.Role of geological structure in the occurrence of earthquake-induced landslides, the case of the 2007 Mid-Niigata Offshore Earthquake, Japan - ScienceDirectThe landslides induced by the Mid-Niigata Offshore earthquake in 2007 (MJMA6.8) occurred mostly along the shore of the Japan Sea.

Stakeholders, decision makers, and emergency managers face an urgent need for operational decision-support tools that provide robust and accurate hazard assessments, when human lives and built environment are at risk. To meet this need, this study presents a new probabilistic procedure for estimating the likelihood that seismic intensity and tsunami inundation will exceed given respective hazard levels. The novelty of the procedure is that a common physical rupture process for shaking and tsunami is explicitly taken into account. The procedure consists of generating numerous stochastic slip distributions of earthquakes with different magnitudes using scaling relationships of source parameters for subduction zones and then using a stochastic synthesis method of earthquake slip distribution. Coupled estimation of earthquake and tsunami intensity parameters is carried out by evaluating spatially correlated strong motion intensity through the adoption of ground motion prediction equations and by solving nonlinear shallow water equations for tsunami wave propagation and inundation. The main output of the proposed procedure is the earthquake-tsunami hazard curves, representing the one-to-one mapping between mean annual rate of occurrence and seismic and inundation tsunami intensity measures. Results are particularly useful for coupled multi-hazard mapping purposes. The developed framework can be further extended to probabilistic seismic and tsunami risk assessment.Probabilistic Earthquake-tsunami Hazard Assessment: The First Step Towards Resilient Coastal Communities - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of the Urban Transitions Conference.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectCoseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectFinite fault models of two large 2011 Tohoku earthquake foreshocks are presented.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectNearest-field tsunami data inversion revealed coseismic slip of the foreshocks.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectSouth-migrating seismicity suggests aseismic slip triggered the Tohoku earthquake.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectForeshock coseismic and postseismic slip areas show complementary distributions.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectA 1981 M7 earthquake asperity ruptured during the largest foreshock in 2011.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectWe estimated the coseismic slip distribution associated with the Mw 7.2 and 6.5 foreshocks of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake based on analysis of the tsunami waveform records obtained just above their focal areas. The results show that the main rupture areas of each of the foreshocks do not overlap with each other, and show a distribution that is complementary to the postseismic slip area of the first Mw 7.2 foreshock as well as to the epicenters of smaller earthquakes during foreshock activity. After the second largest foreshock, seismicity increased in the area between the rupture area of the second largest foreshock and the mainshock epicenter, suggesting propagation of aseismic slip towards the mainshock epicenter. The calculated stress drop of the second largest foreshock was smaller than the largest one, implying strength reduction during the postseismic period of the largest foreshock. Based on a comparison of coastal tsunami records, it is suggested that the asperity ruptured in the M 7.0 earthquake in 1981 ruptured again during the largest foreshock in 2011, but it expanded to the updip side of the 1981 rupture area and became larger in magnitude, exemplifying the irregularity of earthquake recurrence in the area.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Coseismic slip model of offshore moderate interplate earthquakes on March 9, 2011 in Tohoku using tsunami waveforms - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Ocean Sciences, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.Use of residual drift for post-earthquake damage assessment of RC buildings - ScienceDirectUse of residual drift for post-earthquake damage assessment of RC buildings - ScienceDirectTwo approaches were studied for peak drift predication based on residual drift of a building.Use of residual drift for post-earthquake damage assessment of RC buildings - ScienceDirectA full-scale shaking table test was adopted as a case to assess these two methods.Use of residual drift for post-earthquake damage assessment of RC buildings - ScienceDirectThe probabilistic-based framework was recommended for seismic assessment of buildings.Use of residual drift for post-earthquake damage assessment of RC buildings - ScienceDirectLarge earthquakes cause damage to buildings. The peak nonlinear inelastic responses of a building for given seismic ground motions are often used as a proxy for the damage measure. However, the peak responses are rarely recorded or observed for an earthquake event. The residual drift or the permanent deformation of the building after the seismic event can be measured and may be used to infer the degree of sustained damage of the building. Although the use of the residual drift to infer the seismic performance of buildings under earthquakes was explored in the literature, its validation by using full-scale experimental data is unavailable. In this study, test results of a full-scale four-story Reinforced Concrete (RC) building were used as the basis to assess the adequacy of using the residual drift to estimate the damage sustained by the building subjected to ground motions. The seismic performance assessment of this tested building was performed with the peak roof drift calculated from the residual deformation. Analysis results indicated that the approach could be used to infer probabilistically the peak drift of the building based on its residual drift. The degree of uncertainty in this inference is large and should be considered as an integral part of this estimation. Additional issues of using the residual drift as a measure of seismic performance of the building were discussed.Use of residual drift for post-earthquake damage assessment of RC buildings - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Development of Building Damage Functions for Big Earthquakes in Turkey - ScienceDirectDevelopment of Building Damage Functions for Big Earthquakes in Turkey - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Istanbul Univeristy.The forgotten vulnerability: A geology- and history-based approach for ranking the seismic risk of earthquake-prone communities of the Italian Apennines - ScienceDirectThe forgotten vulnerability: A geology- and history-based approach for ranking the seismic risk of earthquake-prone communities of the Italian Apennines - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The forgotten vulnerability: A geology- and history-based approach for ranking the seismic risk of earthquake-prone communities of the Italian Apennines - ScienceDirecthttp://www.ingv.it/.The forgotten vulnerability: A geology- and history-based approach for ranking the seismic risk of earthquake-prone communities of the Italian Apennines - ScienceDirecthttp://www.eventiestremiedisastri.it.Satellite thermal IR and atmospheric radon anomalies associated with the Haripur earthquake (Oct 2010; Mw 5.2), Pakistan - ScienceDirectSatellite thermal IR and atmospheric radon anomalies associated with the Haripur earthquake (Oct 2010; Mw 5.2), Pakistan - ScienceDirectSatellite thermal IR anomalies can serve as a potential indicator of seismic activity related with earthquakes.Satellite thermal IR and atmospheric radon anomalies associated with the Haripur earthquake (Oct 2010; Mw 5.2), Pakistan - ScienceDirectAtmospheric radon fluctuations at the local scale can unfold the precursory effects underlying seismogenic processes.Satellite thermal IR and atmospheric radon anomalies associated with the Haripur earthquake (Oct 2010; Mw 5.2), Pakistan - ScienceDirectWe present a multi-precursory approach within the context of earthquake forecasting.Satellite thermal IR and atmospheric radon anomalies associated with the Haripur earthquake (Oct 2010; Mw 5.2), Pakistan - ScienceDirectSatellite thermal IR and atmospheric radon anomalies associated with the Haripur earthquake (Oct 2010; Mw 5.2), Pakistan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of geological irregularity on the damage of pile foundations during an earthquake - ScienceDirectDue to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, a number of buildings have suffered from damage to pile foundations. Among those, a characteristic damage pattern was found in that only one of many similar size buildings in the same site has suffered from pile damage, while other buildings have seemingly survived. Since these sites are situated in the middle of narrow river valleys, the effect of so-called alluvial valley was suggested. Based on this hypothesis, a series of three-dimensional finite element analyses have been conducted. It was found from the study that due to this irregular ground effect there is a possibility of a building located at the center of a site experiencing larger pile response compared with surrounding buildings when the site is situated in the middle of a narrow river valley.The Christchurch earthquake stroke incidence study - ScienceDirectThe Christchurch earthquake stroke incidence study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Comparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectComparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectWater-level changes by two earthquakes are used to test proposed mechanisms.Comparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectThese changes are inconsistent with the static strain hypothesis.Comparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectEnhanced permeability may be the dominant mechanism for the changes.Comparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectLiquefaction was far more sensitive to the first earthquake than to the second.Comparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectOn 20th April, 2013, a large earthquake (Lushan Mw 6.6) occurred in Sichuan, China, in the same fault zone as the devastating 2008Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. The two earthquakes have similar focal mechanisms and both caused large hydrological changes in the region. The similarity of focal mechanisms, fault zone geology and the abundance of hydrological responses provide a rare opportunity for testing proposed mechanisms for hydrological responses to earthquakes. Using data from wells installed in hard rocks, we find that both the magnitude and the sign of water level changes are inconsistent with those predicted by the coseismic strain hypothesis in the near-field and in the intermediate-field. Instead, permeability change may be the dominant mechanism for the coseismic changes in water level. We also find that the minimum seismic energy required to trigger liquefaction for the Wenchuan earthquake is only 1/20 of that for the Lushan earthquake, suggesting either that the occurrence of liquefaction is more sensitive to low seismic frequencies or that the Wenchuan earthquake changed the sensitivity of unconsolidated materials, and properties had not completely recovered during the 5-year interval between the two earthquakes.Comparison of hydrological responses to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pre-seismic gravity anomalies before Linkou Ms6.4 earthquake by continuous gravity observation of Crustal Movement Observation Network of China - ScienceDirectPre-seismic gravity anomalies before Linkou Ms6.4 earthquake by continuous gravity observation of Crustal Movement Observation Network of China - ScienceDirectXinsheng Wang, Research associate of National Earthquake Infrastructure Service, China Earthquake Administration.

The result of this exercise is to show that homogeneous computation of earthquake moment- and local-magnitude is useful in hazard assessment of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGSs). Data include records from EGSs in Basel (Switzerland), Soultz (France) and Cooper Basin (Australia); natural geothermal fields in Geysers (California) and Hengill (Iceland), and a gas field in Roswinkel (Netherlands). Published catalogue magnitudes are shown to differ widely with respect to Mw, with up to a unit of magnitude difference. We explore the scaling between maximum-amplitude and moment-related scales. We find that given a common magnitude definition for the respective types, the scaling between moment- and local-magnitude of small earthquakes follows a second-order polynomial, consistent with previous studies of natural seismicity. Using both the Southern-California ML scale and a PGV-magnitude scale (Mequiv) determined in this study, we find that the datasets fall into two subsets with well-defined relation to Mw: Basel, Geysers and Hengill in one and Soultz and Roswinkel in another (Cooper Basin data were not considered for this part of the analysis because of the limited bandwidth of the instruments). Mequiv is shown to correlate 1:1 with ML, albeit with region-specific offsets, while the distinct subsets in the Mequiv to MW scaling leads us to conclude that source and/or attenuation properties between the respective regions are different.Magnitude scaling of induced earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Vulnerability Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Building Post-Earthquake - ScienceDirectSome earthquakes that occurred recently, such as the earthquake in Aceh, Padang, Yogyakarta, and in other areas have been many casualties, loss of property, as well as damage to reinforced concrete buildings. Seeing this situation, especially in Indonesia, region frequent earthquakes, a guideline of vulnerability assessments needs to be proposed. This paper presented the evaluation of the vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings against earthquake loads. In support of this study, it was necessary to collect data from a case study before damage occurred and the observation conditions after earthquake of the buildings. Previous studies have been conducted a testing of a case study by providing lateral loads of a building to simulate the earthquake loads. The testing was intended to obtain some type of damage from each step of the loading. This study was conducted to find out the behaviour of damage and deviation that occurred in the case study based on a numerical analysis. Comparing the testing and numerical analysis of the buildings, the analyses were used to make a recommendation whether the building was still in a state of Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety, or Collapse Prevention. The results showed that a proven of assessing visually of the building was agree with the numerical results. This study also made vulnerability assessment forms after earthquakes and a justification of the assessment for reinforced concrete buildings.Vulnerability Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Building Post-Earthquake - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibilty of the Department of Ocean Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.Impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectImpact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectThe evolution of debris flows since the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 is documented.Impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectWe tracked the landslide-debris movements in the epicentral area from 2008 to 2015.Impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectThe rainfall threshold just after the earthquake was one thirds of the pre-earthquake level.Impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectChannelized flows became dominant as more hillslope deposits evolved into channel deposits.Impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectPost-seismic debris flow activities are divided into active, unstable and recession stages.Impact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectImpact of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on subsequent long-term debris flow activities in the epicentral area - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Relocalizing a historical earthquake using recent methods: The 10 November 1935 Earthquake near Montserrat, Lesser Antilles - ScienceDirectRelocalizing a historical earthquake using recent methods: The 10 November 1935 Earthquake near Montserrat, Lesser Antilles - ScienceDirectRelocalizing a historical earthquake using recent methods: The 10 November 1935 Earthquake near Montserrat, Lesser Antilles - ScienceDirectThe focal depth is assumed to be in the lower crust but has large uncertainties.Relocalizing a historical earthquake using recent methods: The 10 November 1935 Earthquake near Montserrat, Lesser Antilles - ScienceDirectA comprehensive method for the relocation of historical earthquakes was developed.Relocalizing a historical earthquake using recent methods: The 10 November 1935 Earthquake near Montserrat, Lesser Antilles - ScienceDirectRelocalizing a historical earthquake using recent methods: The 10 November 1935 Earthquake near Montserrat, Lesser Antilles - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Bifocal earthquake source and its shock precursors - ScienceDirectThe replacement of excess porous space, appeared due to dilatant fracturing, creates the second zone of consolidation inside the earthquake source volume.

This process develops proportionally to a root square of time due to water flows as it was marked in all manuals on earthquake mechanics. The radon emission marks out a dilatant zone from preliminary cracks net in surrounding rocks.Bifocal earthquake source and its shock precursors - ScienceDirectBifocal earthquake source and its shock precursors - ScienceDirectIn the form of the review of natural dates and measurements, the consequence of events in bifocal earthquake source is stated.Bifocal earthquake source and its shock precursors - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake Myths - ScienceDirectEarthquake Myths - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake Myths - ScienceDirectNumerical simulation of the 2008 West-Bohemian earthquake swarm - ScienceDirectNumerical simulation of the 2008 West-Bohemian earthquake swarm - ScienceDirectHigh pressure fluids are triggering and driving the Bohemian swarms.Numerical simulation of the 2008 West-Bohemian earthquake swarm - ScienceDirectTemperature has only a minor influence on the behavior of this system.Numerical simulation of the 2008 West-Bohemian earthquake swarm - ScienceDirectWe can estimate location and magnitude of numerical analogs for earthquakes.Numerical simulation of the 2008 West-Bohemian earthquake swarm - ScienceDirectCO2 has long been suspected of driving the Bohemian earthquake swarms because of the migrating nature of the swarms and expressions of CO2 degassing at the surface. Modeling to date primarily employed linear diffusion models, but more sophisticated modeling that includes a coupled fluid - and rock mechanical model has been lacking. In this work, we apply a model that couples mechanics to heat and flow of a super-critical CO2 through a fracture network. We present a continuum mechanical approach to derive the seismic moment magnitude using the deviatoric strain as an indicator of rupturing processes during individual events. We use a peak-detection algorithm to identify rapid changes in deviatoric strain, indicative of slip events. This method has been shown to work very well in dry and fluid-induced fracturing experiments at the laboratory scale, and in this work we extend the method to the scale of the West Bohemia/Vogtland earthquake swarms. We show very good agreement between model results and observations of the 2008 swarm, further supporting the hypothesis that the Bohemian earthquake swarms are predominately fluid-driven.Numerical simulation of the 2008 West-Bohemian earthquake swarm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Weighted network analysis of earthquake seismic data - ScienceDirectWeighted network analysis of earthquake seismic data - ScienceDirectFor the first time the seismic data has been used to construct a weighted network.Weighted network analysis of earthquake seismic data - ScienceDirectLink weights are found to be highly heterogeneous and in fact, power law distributed.Weighted network analysis of earthquake seismic data - ScienceDirectWeighted network analysis of earthquake seismic data - ScienceDirectStrong rich-club ordering effect is observed.Weighted network analysis of earthquake seismic data - ScienceDirectThree different earthquake seismic data sets are used to construct the earthquake networks following the prescriptions of Abe and Suzuki (2004).

The theory mentioned that the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) could be used to estimate the limiting distribution of the excess value over a certain threshold; thus the tail behaviors are analyzed. However, the central behavior is important because it may affect the estimation of model parameters in GPD, and the evaluation of catastrophic insurance premiums also depends on the central behavior. This paper proposes four mixture models to model earthquake catastrophic loss and proposes Bayesian approaches to estimate the unknown parameters and the threshold in these mixture models. MCMC methods are used to calculate the Bayesian estimates of model parameters, and deviance information criterion values are obtained for model comparison. The earthquake loss of Yunnan province is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. Results show that the estimation of the threshold and the shape and scale of GPD are quite different. Value-at-risk and expected shortfall for the proposed mixture models are calculated under different confidence levels.Bayesian approaches for analyzing earthquake catastrophic risk - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault - ScienceDirectSentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault - ScienceDirectCoseismic deformation of the Menyuan earthquake from Sentinel-1.Sentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault - ScienceDirectFirst geodetic evidence on the link between reverse and strike-slip faults in NE TibetSentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault - ScienceDirectGeometric complexities control rupture size resulting in high stress dropSentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault - ScienceDirectSentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquakes and Religious Thoughts - ScienceDirectEarthquakes and Religious Thoughts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquakes and Religious Thoughts - ScienceDirectResource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectResource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectThis study is based on WhatsApp messages exchanged among medical professionals in the aftermath of 2015 Nepal earthquake.Resource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectThe study assimilates knowledge about phase-wise requirements of various types of resources in the aftermath of a disaster.Resource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectSuch knowledge can help government agencies and first responders to be better prepared to mitigate any upcoming disaster.Resource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectReal-time analysis of such data would assist decision makers in forming resource mapping strategies dynamically.Resource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectResource mapping during a natural disaster: A case study on the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are two earthquakes better than one? How earthquakes in two different regions affect risk judgments and preparation in three locations - ScienceDirectResearch has shown that experiencing a single disaster influences people's risk judgments about the hazard, but few studies have studied how multiple disasters in different locations affect risk judgments. Following two earthquake sequences in two different regions (Christchurch, Cook Strait), this study examined earthquake risk judgments, non-fatalism and preparation in two New Zealand cities that were near to one of those sequences (Christchurch in Canterbury, Wellington near Cook Strait) and in one city that was distant from both events (Palmerston North). Judgments of earthquake likelihood were higher after the Cook Strait earthquakes than before in Christchurch and the rest of New Zealand, but not in Wellington, where the baseline risk was high. However, participants in all cities saw the risk as more real, plausible, and important after these earthquakes, particularly in Wellington. Preparations following the earthquakes were also higher in Wellington and Christchurch (where non-fatalism was highest) than in Palmerston North. Causal attributions for (not) preparing differed across the three cities, as did non-fatalism. These findings suggest that the Christchurch and Cook Strait earthquakes had a combined effect on citizens' perception of the risk, particularly in Wellington. Such events create a valuable window of opportunity for agencies wishing to enhance preparedness.Are two earthquakes better than one?

On the other hand Chile, one of the most seismically active countries in the world, is an exception to this practice. Any Chilean residential building higher than 5 stories is almost completely made up of reinforced concrete shear walls. Surprisingly, only 2% of the residential building inventory subjected to the 2010 Chile earthquake (Mw 8.8) suffered severe damage, even though many structures were affected by ground accelerations larger than those prescribed in the Chilean seismic design code. This observation suggests that there is a large (and unintended) overstrength in this type of buildings. In a previous study, the authors showed that some of the traditional sources of overstrength mentioned in the literature could explain the lack of damage in low rise buildings but not in taller structures. Motivated by this observation, representative tall buildings were reanalyzed using more realistic models (e.g., flexural capacity of the walls assessed by fiber models) in order to get more insight into their actual seismic capacity. Two actual buildings of 17 and 26 stories that survived with no damage the 2010 Chile earthquake were analyzed by response history analysis. Results show that consideration of wall flanges (usually omitted in practice) cannot explain the lack of damage. On the other hand, it is observed that good performance might be a consequence of possible foundation uplift. Finally, the analyses also suggest that, even when there is no damage, elastic analysis has limitations to reproduce the actual observed behavior.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectSetting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectOne-in-a-million has been adopted as the maximum tolerable earthquake fatality risk.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectThe required collapse risk limits for various types of structures were calculated.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectCurrent performance goals in structural design are inadequate for mortality control.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectThe expected number of deaths is a better measure of the aggregated societal risk.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectThe general public should have a role in setting earthquake safety requirements.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk - ScienceDirectStructural engineers design buildings according to the earthquake action (demand) specified in code of practice, whilst the rationale behind such requirement is commonly untold. In fact, even if a structure is designed strictly in accordance to the best standard and practice in the world, there is still a (small) chance of failure or collapse in an extreme earthquake event, due to the uncertainties in material properties and actual ground motions characteristics. This is the residual risk, which is unavoidable, and should be taken as a governing parameter for determining the performance goals of seismic design. This study attempts to establish the required (target) collapse risk limits for designing different types of ordinary buildings based on a well-accepted tolerable level of mortality risk and estimates of fatality rates in buildings. The proposed limits are compared with the target risk of collapse stipulated in the 2012 edition of the International Building Code (IBC). The risk-based approach presented in this paper should also be applicable for setting performance objectives for structural design of buildings and infrastructure against other natural, human-caused and technological hazards.Setting structural safety requirement for controlling earthquake mortality risk -

ScienceDirectInput energy to building structures during earthquakes is an important index to measure the influence of earthquake ground motions on building structures. Such input energy can be defined after the structural system is specified and the input mechanism is described clearly. The energy input to structures consists mainly of the energy dissipated by hysteretic deformation and that by viscous damping. The excessive dependence on the former mechanism leads to unrepairable and unpreferable states of structures after earthquakes which should be avoided from the viewpoint of sustainability of building structures and cities. In this sense, the measure of energy is appropriate from the viewpoint of total management of buildings in a sustainable city. Then the upper bound of earthquake input energy is derived and discussed under uncertain conditions on input ground motions. It is shown that the earthquake energy input rate is another key parameter for measuring the instantaneous effect of earthquake ground motions on structural responses. A historical review is also made on the development of treatment of earthquake input energy into buildings and on its role into greater building earthquake resilience in sustainable cities.Building earthquake resilience in sustainable cities in terms of input energy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake strikes Iran and Iraq - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Holocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectHolocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectMultidisciplinary approach used to characterize active deformation of an intracontinental normal fault.Holocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectGeomorphological indices mark the tectonic activity of the Kenchreai Fault.Holocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectOffset and slip history of the Kenchreai fault through palaeoseismicity.Holocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectSlip-predictable earthquake recurrence model.Holocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectPaleoseismic similarity to other short length faults.Holocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectHolocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (156KB)Download full-size imageHolocene record of slip-predictable earthquakes on the Kenchreai Fault, Gulf of Corinth, Greece - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mantle wedge exhumation beneath the Dora-Maira (U)HP dome unravelled by local earthquake tomography (Western Alps) - ScienceDirectMantle wedge exhumation beneath the Dora-Maira (U)HP dome unravelled by local earthquake tomography (Western Alps) - ScienceDirectHigh-resolution image of the seismic velocity structure of the Alpine mantle wedgeMantle wedge exhumation beneath the Dora-Maira (U)HP dome unravelled by local earthquake tomography (Western Alps) - ScienceDirectFirst geophysical evidence of mantle-wedge exhumation during continental subductionMantle wedge exhumation beneath the Dora-Maira (U)HP dome unravelled by local earthquake tomography (Western Alps) - ScienceDirectMantle wedge exhumation is favoured by upper plate divergent motion.Mantle wedge exhumation beneath the Dora-Maira (U)HP dome unravelled by local earthquake tomography (Western Alps) - ScienceDirectMantle wedge exhumation beneath the Dora-Maira (U)HP dome unravelled by local earthquake tomography (Western Alps) - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (446KB)Download full-size imageHow do survivors perceive community resilience?

The case of the 2011 earthquakes in Van, Turkey - ScienceDirectUnderstanding and facilitating community resilience have been increasingly acknowledged as important aspects of disaster risk management. The concept is often described as bouncing back or forward following disaster events. Various attempts have been made to conceptualize resilience of communities and individuals to disasters. The present research aimed to qualitatively explore survivors' perceptions of community resilience in the case of the 2011 Van earthquakes in Turkey. To this end, in-depth interviews were conducted, as part of a large-scale study, with twenty earthquake survivors recruited through snowball sampling in Van. Consensual qualitative research method was employed for data analysis. The findings provided an understanding of both specific indicators related to resilience in the post-quake period and also how survivors perceive characteristics related to general resilience for earthquakes. The findings pointed out that resilience is perceived to be related to provision of adequate, timely aid and services distributed fairly and to good governance, financial resources, and faith following earthquakes as well as to awareness, preparedness and mitigation, and social solidarity before quakes. The implications of the findings for disaster risk management with a view of facilitating resilience and suggestions for future research are provided.How do survivors perceive community resilience?

Evidence from the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectThis paper uses the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China to examine if the occurrence of a natural disaster can cause an excessive fear of living in upper floors. We rely on potential variations in earthquake risk perceptions by floor level to assess whether the pricing of apartments in lower versus upper floors is consistent with a disproportionate fear of heights. We use a unique transaction dataset for new apartment units in the affected area. We find that the relative price of low to high floor units, particularly units located in the first and second floor, considerably increased for several months after the earthquake and then returned back to the levels observed prior to the tremor. This temporal increase in relative prices is in line with a higher risk perception and fear, triggered after the earthquake, of living in upper floors, which gradually dissipated over time. The results are robust to alternative model estimations.Do natural disasters cause an excessive fear of heights?

The earthquake magnitude, and the associated dynamic stresses, has positive roles in both the sensitivity of water level to earthquake induced change, and the amplitude and duration of resulting coseismic water level changes. Wells whose water levels are sensitive to Earth tides have high potential to response to earthquakes. Polarities of step-like changes (rises or drops) are locally controlled and spatially variable, with artesian wells generally recording water-level rises. Permeability enhancement was assessed as a mechanism responsible for step-like changes by analyzing the tidal phase responses. Permeability variations are inferred for 17 out of 95 wells with step-like changes during the Nepal earthquake and for 32 out of 105 wells following the Japan earthquake; however, only 6 wells have permeability variations after both earthquakes.Coseismic water level changes induced by two distant earthquakes in multiple wells of the Chinese mainland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectEarthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectLaboratory test, constitutive model and numerical simulation are combined to study slope response.Earthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectA disturbance and stress dependent model for strain softening behavior of sensitive clayEarthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectPost-peak strain localization at shallow depth triggers large permanent displacement.Earthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectThe most unfavorable disturbing depth due to the coupled effect of soil disturbanceEarthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectMany submarine landslides occur through marine sensitive clay layers, and the strain softening behavior plays a key role. The changing soil properties induced by various disturbances will have marked impact on earthquake performance of submarine clay slopes. In the present study, undrained triaxial compression tests on reconsolidated samples of a soft sensitive marine clay were conducted, and a soil disturbance dependent simple constitutive model is proposed for describing post-peak nonlinear strain softening behavior of sensitive clays based on experimental results, and then is implemented in QUIVER code to perform one-dimensional seismic response analysis of mild infinite slopes, to address the relative importance of soil disturbance effect on the site response and sliding displacement of submerged slopes during seismic loading. Detailed laboratory test descriptions and results of a soft sensitive marine clay, model formulations and comprehensive computational efforts are presented. Parametric study of site response analysis focusing on the effects of soil disturbance degree and depth on generic clay grounds with varying sloping angles subjected to harmonic and earthquake loadings are performed. The predicted acceleration amplification, maximum shear strains and permanent displacements provide insight of earthquake performance of submarine sensitive clay slopes.Earthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectThe main findings are drawn based on several key concepts. First, undisturbed sensitive clay is typically stiffer and stronger than disturbed clay consolidated at the same stress level and hence, unless strain softening is triggered, structured sensitive clay will perform better than insensitive clay of the same residual strength. Second, post-peak softening at shallow depth will lead to strain localization on a thin layer, which is the main cause of sudden change of upward wave propagation characteristics and large permanent displacement at seabed surface of mild submarine clay slope. Thirdly, soil disturbance degrees and depths have very marked effects on seismic response and displacement performance of sensitive clay slopes, and such effect will be further enhanced by slope angle or earthquake intensity, which should be cautiously treated in engineering design.Earthquake response and sliding displacement of submarine sensitive clay slopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Public perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectPublic perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectHuman induced earthquakes were perceived as more negative than natural earthquakes.Public perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectAttributing benefits to renewable energy did not increase earthquake acceptability.Public perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectAcceptability was highest after a procedurally fair decision making process.Public perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectAcceptability was lowest following an expert-driven decision.Public perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectPublic perceptions and acceptance of induced earthquakes related to energy development - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectFracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectFracture energy is related to deep aseismic slip on strike-slip faults.Fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectThis relation resembles that for dip-slip faults.Fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectThe estimated fracture energy is smaller than values shown in previous studies.Fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectEarthquake cycles along a pure strike-slip fault were numerically simulated using a rate- and state-dependent friction law to obtain the fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points. In the model, deep aseismic slip is imposed on the fault, which generates recurrent earthquakes in the shallower velocity-weakening friction region. The fracture energy at the rupture nucleation point for each simulated earthquake was calculated using the relation between shear stress and slip, which indicates slip-weakening behavior. The simulation results show that the relation between the fracture energy at the nucleation point and other source parameters is consistent with a theoretical approach based on fracture mechanics, in that an earthquake occurs when the energy release rate at the tip of the aseismic slip zone first exceeds the fracture energy. Because the energy release rate is proportional to the square of the amount of deep aseismic slip during the interseismic period, which can be estimated from the recurrence interval of earthquakes and the deep aseismic slip rate, the fracture energies for strike-slip earthquakes can be calculated. Using this result, we estimated the fracture energies at the nucleation points of large earthquakes on selected segments of the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China. We find that the estimated fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points are generally smaller than the values of average fracture energy for developed ruptures as estimated in previous studies, suggesting that the fracture energy tends to increase with the rupture propagation distance.Fracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (193KB)Download full-size imageFracture energies at the rupture nucleation points of large strike-slip earthquakes on the Xianshuihe fault, southwestern China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake nucleation and triggering on an optimally oriented fault - ScienceDirectEarthquake nucleation and triggering on an optimally oriented fault - ScienceDirectSpatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectSpatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectThis study investigates the spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors.Spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectTwo well-documented earthquakes in New Zealand were used to investigate the spatial variation of MSF.Spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectA general trend was identified that MSF correlate with PGA.Spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectFrom a seismic demand perspective, PGA is more influential on liquefaction triggering than MSF.Spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe combination of well-documented liquefaction response during the Darfield and Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes, densely-recorded ground motions for the events, and detailed subsurface characterization provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the significance of the spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors (MSF) on liquefaction triggering. Towards this end, MSF were computed at 15 SMS sites across Christchurch and its surroundings using two established approaches. Trends in the spatial variation of the MSF computed using number of equivalent cycles (neq) from both approaches were similar, with the spatial variation being more significant for the Christchurch earthquake than the Darfield earthquake. However, there was no consistent trend for regions with lower computed MSF having experienced more severe or widespread liquefaction. Additionally, there is a general correlation between MSF and amax, but because amax ranges more widely than MSF it has a greater influence on the resulting seismic demand imposed on the soil than MSF does. Nevertheless, the spatial variation of the MSF is deemed significant enough that it warrants being considered for incorporation into future variants of simplified liquefaction evaluation procedures.Spatial variation of magnitude scaling factors during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Traditional earthquake resistant techniques for vernacular architecture and local seismic cultures: A literature review - ScienceDirectSpecific architectural elements can be identified in constructions located in regions frequently exposed to earthquakes. These earthquake resistant features were developed empirically by local communities to protect their built-up environment. Research in these traditional earthquake resistant practices, resulting from a local seismic culture, is a relevant and positive approach, since it focuses on the strengths of a system rather than on its weaknesses. Its integration into current vernacular building practices can help to preserve and retrofit surviving in-use examples without prejudice to their identity. This paper presents an overview of the most common techniques traditionally used around the world, based on literature review. Additionally, it identifies the use of these techniques in the Portuguese vernacular heritage in order to contribute for the awareness and strength of the local seismic culture in Portugal.Traditional earthquake resistant techniques for vernacular architecture and local seismic cultures: A literature review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Atmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectAtmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectAtmospheric changes for the April 2015 Gorkha earthquake have been examined.Atmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectAOD and columnar ozone increased by 40% and 6% respectively prior to the earthquake.Atmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectColumnar NO2, UVI and AOD levels increased following the earthquake.Atmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectThe sea level pressure and columnar ozone levels dropped following the earthquake.Atmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectAtmospheric changes observed during April 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectEarthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectEstimating seismic hazard potential in Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China.Earthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectEarthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectEarthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectMoment accumulation/release model forecasts eq potential on major faults.Earthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectEarthquake potential of the Sichuan-Yunnan region, western China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The state of stress in the Earth's crust along the northwestern flank of the Pacific seismic focal zone before the Tohoku earthquake of 11 March 2011 - ScienceDirectThe state of stress in the Earth's crust along the northwestern flank of the Pacific seismic focal zone before the Tohoku earthquake of 11 March 2011 - ScienceDirectThis paper presents a detailed reconstruction of the state of stress in the Earth's crust before the Tohoku earthquake of March 11, 2011.The state of stress in the Earth's crust along the northwestern flank of the Pacific seismic focal zone before the Tohoku earthquake of 11 March 2011 - ScienceDirectThe earthquake focal mechanisms are taken from two cataloguers:http://www.fnet.bosai.go.jp;

Seismic time series of the four most active Chilean zones, the country with largest seismic activity, are analyzed in this study in order to discover precursory patterns for large earthquakes. First, raw data are transformed by removing aftershocks and foreshocks, since the goal is to only predict main shocks. New attributes, based on the well-known b-value, are also generated. Later, these data are labeled, and consequently discretized, by the application of a clustering algorithm, following the suggestions found in recent literature. Earthquakes with magnitude larger than 4.4 are identified in the time series. Finally, the sequence of labels acting as precursory patterns for such earthquakes are searched for within the datasets. Results verging on 70% on average are reported, leading to conclude that the methodology proposed is suitable to be applied in other zones with similar seismicity.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectAdaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectAdaptive regularization can achieve a significantly smaller mean square error than uniform one.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectAn adaptive regularization method based on weighted total least squares is proposed.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectThe proposed method can derive a smaller mean square error than uniform regularization.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectRegularization is a routine approach used in earthquake slip distribution inversion to avoid numerically abnormal solutions. To date, most slip inversion studies have imposed uniform regularization on all the fault patches. However, adaptive regularization, where each retrieved parameter is regularized differently, has exhibited better performances in other research fields such as image restoration. In this paper, we implement an investigation into adaptive regularization for earthquake slip distribution inversion. It is found that adaptive regularization can achieve a significantly smaller mean square error (MSE) than uniform regularization, if it is set properly. We propose an adaptive regularization method based on weighted total least squares (WTLS). This approach assumes that errors exist in both the regularization matrix and observation, and an iterative algorithm is used to solve the solution. A weight coefficient is used to balance the regularization matrix residual and the observation residual. An experiment using four slip patterns was carried out to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed regularization method can derive a smaller MSE than uniform regularization and resolution-based adaptive regularization, and the improvement in MSE is more significant for slip patterns with low-resolution slip patches. In this paper, we apply the proposed regularization method to study the slip distribution of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. The retrieved slip distribution is less smooth and more detailed than the one retrieved with the uniform regularization method, and is closer to the existing slip model from joint inversion of the geodetic and seismic data.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectCurrent affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectJapan has made no success of EQ prediction.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectAuthorities officially gave up short-term prediction.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectThis situation is a chance for non-seismological approach.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectMaintaining high scientific standards is important.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectCurrent affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Response of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectResponse of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectResponse of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectResponse of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectLong duration motion observed due to free vibration of sediments and 2D/3D effects.Response of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectAcceleration amplification ratios as high as 3.5 (in NS direction) is observed.Response of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectResponse of Marmaray Submerged Tunnel during 2014 Northern Aegean Earthquake (Mw=6.9) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectAdaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectAdaptive regularization can achieve a significantly smaller mean square error than uniform one.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectAn adaptive regularization method based on weighted total least squares is proposed.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectThe proposed method can derive a smaller mean square error than uniform regularization.Adaptive regularization of earthquake slip distribution inversion - ScienceDirectRegularization is a routine approach used in earthquake slip distribution inversion to avoid numerically abnormal solutions.

As such, it represents a key parameter for improving our understanding of earthquake source physics and for reliable ground motion prediction. Large earthquake populations usually show variations in stress release as large as three orders of magnitude, but the underlying mechanisms have remained largely elusive, and particularly the dependence of stress release on earthquake size is still a matter of debate. Here I use a unique dataset from Japan encompassing earthquakes of a wide magnitude range and spatial coverage to show that stress release variations of crustal earthquakes are strongly correlated with heat flow variations, indicating that they are thermally controlled. In contrast, subcrustal events depict highest stress release in regions of strong subduction-interface coupling and overall less pronounced variability as compared with crustal earthquakes. Stress release is overall only weakly dependent on earthquake size, but at local scales (i.e., within individual earthquake sequences) the dependence can be very strong and apparently varies with stress regime. Accounting for these systematic variations reduces the stress release variability on local scale by a factor of two to three as compared with the full earthquake population, a finding that is of key significance in the endeavor to reduce the uncertainties in future ground motion predictions.On the characteristics of earthquake stress release variations in Japan - ScienceDirectOn the characteristics of earthquake stress release variations in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Detection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectDetection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectRevised methodological framework of 6 criteria for coastal paleoseismic studies.Detection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectNew evidence from southcentral Alaska to illustrate different detection limits.Detection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectNo earthquake within last 4000 years had same rupture pattern as 1964 earthquake.Detection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectDetection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectDetection limits of tidal-wetland sequences to identify variable rupture modes of megathrust earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectStatistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectWe examine the relationship between triggered tremors and low-frequency earthquakes.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectLow-frequency earthquakes could be triggered repeatedly by large distant earthquakes.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectLow-frequency earthquake is a basic element of triggered tremor.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectLocations of low-frequency earthquakes suggest that the source structure is complex.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectWe analyze statistical properties of LFEs.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectStatistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 404 894 0231; fax: +1 404 894 5638.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectTel.: +886 2 2783 9910x521; fax: +886 2 2783 9871.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectTel.: +81 804 447 3228.Statistical properties of low-frequency earthquakes triggered by large earthquakes in southern Taiwan - ScienceDirectTel.: +886 5 2720 411x66202; fax: +886 5 2720 807.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectDetecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectDiscovery of precursory patterns for medium-large earthquakes in Chile.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectb-value's ability to predict earthquakes is confirmed.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectGeneral purpose methodology: can be applied to any other area.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectAccuracy rate above 70%.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectThe prediction of earthquakes is a task of utmost difficulty that has been widely addressed by using many different strategies, with no particular good results thus far. Seismic time series of the four most active Chilean zones, the country with largest seismic activity, are analyzed in this study in order to discover precursory patterns for large earthquakes. First, raw data are transformed by removing aftershocks and foreshocks, since the goal is to only predict main shocks. New attributes, based on the well-known b-value, are also generated. Later, these data are labeled, and consequently discretized, by the application of a clustering algorithm, following the suggestions found in recent literature. Earthquakes with magnitude larger than 4.4 are identified in the time series. Finally, the sequence of labels acting as precursory patterns for such earthquakes are searched for within the datasets. Results verging on 70% on average are reported, leading to conclude that the methodology proposed is suitable to be applied in other zones with similar seismicity.Detecting precursory patterns to enhance earthquake prediction in Chile - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake early warning application to buildings - ScienceDirectIn California, United States, an earthquake early warning system is currently being tested through the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN). The system aims to provide warnings in seconds to tens of seconds prior to the occurrence of ground shaking at a site; since the system broadcasts the location and time of the earthquake, user software can estimate the arrival time and intensity of the expected S-wave. However, the shaking experienced by a user in a tall building will be significantly different from that on the ground. This paper provides a method to develop engineering applications in earthquake early warning system using Performance-based Earthquake Engineering framework. An example is included to estimate the characteristics of shaking that can be expected in mid-rise to high-rise buildings. Potential engineering applications (e.g. elevator control) for buildings based on the prediction of building shaking level are also addressed.Earthquake early warning application to buildings - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectCurrent affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectJapan has made no success of EQ prediction.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectAuthorities officially gave up short-term prediction.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectThis situation is a chance for non-seismological approach.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectMaintaining high scientific standards is important.Current affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectCurrent affairs in earthquake prediction in Japan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.How was Felt Van Earthquake by a Neighbor University Hospital? - ScienceDirectNatural disasters, which are defined as events causing great damage or loss of life, are events of natural origin unpreventable by human beings that occur in a short period of time and lead to loss of life and property.

However, the greater part of damage has been sustained by the city of Christchurch which is built on a layered sequence of artesian aquifers. In this paper we focus on responses in these coastal aquifers. We quantify groundwater responses with a simple model which differentiates between immediate earthquake induced response (spike) and post-seismic change (offset). The most significant feature of our analysis is the consistent pattern of groundwater response to the earthquakes: deeper wells correlate with negative offset and shallower wells correlate with positive offset. This is consistent with the upwards vertical movement of water. We consider the hydrological and engineering consequences.Groundwater responses to the recent Canterbury earthquakes: a comparison - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Examining associations between citizens' beliefs and attitudes about uncertainty and their earthquake risk judgments, preparedness intentions, and mitigation policy support in Japan and the United States - ScienceDirectExamining associations between citizens' beliefs and attitudes about uncertainty and their earthquake risk judgments, preparedness intentions, and mitigation policy support in Japan and the United States - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Maximum earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian fault zone - ScienceDirectMaximum earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian fault zone - ScienceDirectMaximum earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian fault zone - ScienceDirectThe maximum earthquake magnitudes along different fault zone sections are discussed in relation to key fault zone parameters.Maximum earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian fault zone - ScienceDirectThe largest earthquakes are exclusively observed along the older eastern part of the North Anatolian Fault Zone.Maximum earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian fault zone - ScienceDirectThe results suggest that the maximum magnitude in the Istanbul region would probably not exceed M 7.5.Maximum earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian fault zone - ScienceDirectA tale of two cities: Judgments about earthquake and aftershock probabilities across time windows - ScienceDirectResearch has shown that people often misinterpret probabilities reported by experts in the media. Previous research has found that people who are given a certain probability of a volcano eruption in a specific time window judge risk as higher in later time intervals within that window. The present study examines whether a similar pattern occurs with earthquakes and aftershocks. Participants in Wellington (N=102) and Christchurch (N=98) in New Zealand read expert forecasts of the risk of a Wellington earthquake and a large Christchurch aftershock within specified time windows, then estimated the risk in specific intervals across the time window. Participants judged the Wellington earthquake risk as higher toward the end of the 50 year time window whereas for a Christchurch aftershock, risk estimates initially increased then plateaued. Likelihood of preparing showed a different pattern to earthquake likelihood and was constant over the time windows. These findings suggest the influence of base rates and lay theories on interpretations of scientific forecasts.A tale of two cities: Judgments about earthquake and aftershock probabilities across time windows - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A tale of two cities: Judgments about earthquake and aftershock probabilities across time windows - ScienceDirectNonextensivity measure for earthquake networks - ScienceDirectNonextensivity measure for earthquake networks - ScienceDirectWe show the q-exponential appears as an appropriate function for fitting the degree distribution of the earthquake networks.Nonextensivity measure for earthquake networks - ScienceDirectWe show that the q-exponent as a function of resolution has a peak.Nonextensivity measure for earthquake networks - ScienceDirectNonextensivity measure for earthquake networks - ScienceDirectStudying earthquakes and the associated geodynamic processes based on the complex network theory enables us to learn about the universal features of the earthquake phenomenon. In addition, we can determine new indices for identification of regions geophysically. It was found that earthquake networks are scale free and its degree distribution obeys the power law. Here we claim that the q-exponential function is better than power law model for fitting the degree distribution. We also study the behavior of q parameter (nonextensivity measure) with respect to resolution. It was previously asserted in Eur. Phys. J. B (2012) 85: 23; that the topological characteristics of earthquake networks are dependent on each other for large values of the resolution. A peak in the plot of q against resolution determines the beginning of the assertion range.Nonextensivity measure for earthquake networks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Trench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectTrench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectPressure records document slip to trench after the 2012 Costa Rica earthquake.Trench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectAfterslip over a wide updip range caused both onshore and offshore deformation.Trench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectShallow megathrust resisted earthquake rupture but slipped slowly afterwards.Trench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectShallow slip at Costa Rica contrasts with the trench-breaching 2011 Tohoku-oki rupture.Trench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectLarge rupture of the shallowest portion of subduction thrust faults (megathrusts), such as during the 2011 moment magnitude (Mw) 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake, can generate the most devastating tsunamis. However, it remains unclear whether such trench-breaching rupture is typical of other subduction earthquakes. The main difficulty in answering this question is the common lack of near-trench geodetic monitoring in subduction zones worldwide. Seafloor and sub-seafloor fluid pressure measurements at two closely located borehole observatories in the Middle America trench have provided clear evidence for the absence of trench-breaching rupture during the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake, and for the presence of substantial trench-breaching afterslip at slow rates after the rupture (Davis et al., 2015). In this study, we compare postseismic seafloor pressure change at the trench with coastal Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) displacements. The same temporal characteristics of the deformation at the trench and coastal sites indicate that both offshore and onshore deformation were the consequence of afterslip that occurred over a wide spatial range updip of the rupture. By determining the co- and post-seismic slip distributions and inferring the associated shear stress changes on the megathrust, we show that the mechanical behaviour varies in the dip direction. The slip behaviour of the shallow megathrust at Costa Rica is consistent with conventional conceptual models, and contrasts with the behaviour of the shallowest megathrust during the Tohoku-oki event.Trench-breaching afterslip following deeper coseismic slip of the 2012 Mw 7.6 Costa Rica earthquake constrained by near-trench pressure and land-based geodetic observations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Finite element modelling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake through the joint exploitation of DInSAR measurements and geologic-structural information - ScienceDirectFinite element modelling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake through the joint exploitation of DInSAR measurements and geologic-structural information - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Upper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectUpper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectEarthquakes in Garhwal Himalaya are related to the Mid-Crustal-Ramp of detachment.Upper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectNE-SW trending maximum compressive stress is a driving force.Upper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectActive faults in Chamoli have decreasing frictional strength.Upper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectFree fluids penetrating around Chamoli region are decreasing the fault strength.Upper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectUpper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (357KB)Download full-size imageUpper crustal stress and seismotectonics of the Garhwal Himalaya using small-to-moderate earthquakes: Implications to the local structures and free fluids - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Aspects of Earthquake Risk Management in Slovenia - ScienceDirectThis article presents the collaboration of two inter-disciplinary research projects on earthquake risk management for Slovenia and its capital city Ljubljana.

Building Information Modeling (BIM), rapid scanning and other assessment technologies offer the opportunity not only to retrieve as-built information but also to compile as-damaged models. This research proposes an information model to facilitate the data flow for post-earthquake assessment of reinforced concrete structures. The schema development was based on typical damage modes and the existing Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema. Two examples of damaged structures from recent earthquake events, compiled using an experimental damage modeling software, illustrate the use of the data model. The model introduces two new classes, one to represent segments of building elements and the other to model the relationships between segments and cracks. A unique feature is the ability to model the process of damage with a binary tree structure. Methods for exporting as-damaged instance models using IFC are also discussed.Information modeling of earthquake-damaged reinforced concrete structures - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Information modeling of earthquake-damaged reinforced concrete structures - ScienceDirectTel.: +972 4 8293190.Information modeling of earthquake-damaged reinforced concrete structures - ScienceDirectTel.: +972 4 8293120.Geophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectGeophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectThe HVSR was adopted for site effects estimations in term of dominant frequency.Geophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectSurface waves dispersion properties were used to obtain shear wave velocity values.Geophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectGeophysical/geological subsoil models for the investigated areas were obtained.Geophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectThe obtained outcomes represent a first level microzonation study useful for land planning.Geophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectGeophysical and geologic surveys of the areas struck by the August 26th 2016 Central Italy earthquake: The study case of Pretare and Piedilama - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.People's risk perception in earthquake prone Quetta city of Baluchistan - ScienceDirectLarge parts of Pakistan lie within a seismically active Himalayan belt. The experts suspect that in the next century, damages from earthquakes would be unprecedented. The objective of this paper is to examine the perception of people living with earthquake risks in Quetta, using key informant interviews, community group discussions and structured household survey. The survey has been conducted among 200 households, applying the simple random sampling method. The study explored the relationship among different variables including socio-economic status of the respondents using multivariate statistics. The results revealed that earthquake risk perception associates significantly with the people's age, income, education etc. Further, the perception of earthquake risk varies among different governmental and non-governmental organizations and community members. The survey results also reveal that people know the risks posed by earthquakes but have fatalistic attitudes towards the future predictions of the earthquakes. The paper recommends programs and projects to create public awareness and preparedness for risk reduction.People's risk perception in earthquake prone Quetta city of Baluchistan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectDamage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectWe describe in detail the damage observed at the Longxi tunnel cross a fault zone.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectSerious damage and even collapse of the tunnel occurred close to the faulted zone.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectWe present a detailed 3D numerical model to determine the mechanisms of damage.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectWe discuss effects of seismic input directions and the fault on the tunnel damage.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectThe longitudinal seismic motion has a significant effect on tunnel performance.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectThe Longxi tunnel was one of the most damaged tunnels during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China. What makes the case interesting is that the tunnel crosses a fault zone. Damage from small to heavy cracking was observed both at the portal and inside the tunnel, while sections close to the fault completely collapsed. A full three-dimensional dynamic finite element model of the tunnel and rock system is used to assess the seismic damage observed in the tunnel and to evaluate the influence of the longitudinal and vertical motions on the seismic response. A comparison between the numerical predictions and the damage reported shows a good agreement. The results indicate that the longitudinal earthquake motion has a significant effect on the response of the tunnel structure and should be considered for the structural design of tunnels in seismic zones. In contrast, the vertical seismic motions can generally be neglected.Damage observation and assessment of the Longxi tunnel during the Wenchuan earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Threshold magnitude for Ionospheric TEC response to earthquakes -

The PSR without changes of principal stress magnitudes can generate additional excess pore water pressures and plastic strains, thus accelerating liquefaction in undrained conditions. This paper simulates a centrifuge model test using the fully coupled finite element method considering the PSR. The impact of PSR under the earthquake loading is taken into account by using an elastoplastic soil model developed on the basis of a kinematic hardening soil model with the bounding surface concept. The soil model considers the PSR by treating the stress rate generating the PSR independently. The capability of this soil model is verified by comparing the numerical predictions and experimental results. It also indicates that the PSR impact can not be ignored in predictions of soil liquefaction.Numerical simulation of earthquake-induced liquefactions considering the principal stress rotation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Seismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectNumerical implementation of seismic soil pile structure interaction by including contact and sliding behavior between soil and pile, earthquake and absorbing boundary conditions for semi infinite soil domain, soil nonlinearity under small loading condition, integrated superstructure and foundation system has been considered.Seismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectEffect of 2015 Nepal earthquake on asymmetrical buildings of different configuration like L, T and C shape including interaction effect.Seismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectStudy the effect of peak ground acceleration of the earthquake and asymmetry of the buildings on its response to understand the risk criterion under seismic event.Seismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectComparative analysis of 3 different earthquakes with Nepal earthquake in context of asymmetrical buildings.Seismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectSeismic soil structure interaction analysis for asymmetrical buildings supported on piled raft for the 2015 Nepal earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gravity variation in the Tibet area before the Nepal Ms8.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectGravity variation in the Tibet area before the Nepal Ms8.1 earthquake - ScienceDirectHongtao Hao, assistant research at Institute of Seismology, China Earthquake Administration.

We numerically investigate the influence of seismic wave interaction with volcanic systems simulated as a trapped, high-pressure fluid reservoir connected to a fluid-filled fault system in a 2-D poroelastic medium. Different orientations and earthquake magnitudes are studied to quantify dynamic and static stress, and pore pressure changes induced by a seismic event. Results show that although the response of the system is mainly dominated by characteristics of the radiated seismic waves, local structures can also play an important role on the system dynamics. The fluid reservoir affects the seismic wave front, distorts the static overpressure pattern induced by the earthquake, and concentrates the kinetic energy of the incoming wave on its boundaries. The static volumetric stress pattern inside the fault system is also affected by the local structures. Our results show that local faults play an important role in earthquake-volcanic systems dynamics by concentrating kinetic energy inside and acting as wave-guides that have a breakwater-like behavior. This generates sudden changes in pore pressure, volumetric expansion, and stress gradients. Local structures also influence the regional Coulomb yield function. Our results show that local structures affect the dynamics of volcanic and hydrothermal systems, and should be taken into account when investigating triggering of these systems from nearby or distant earthquakes.Numerical simulations (2D) on the influence of pre-existing local structures and seismic source characteristics in earthquake-volcano interactions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Discrete bonded particle modelling of fault activation near a nuclear waste repository site and comparison to static rupture earthquake scaling laws - ScienceDirectDiscrete bonded particle modelling of fault activation near a nuclear waste repository site and comparison to static rupture earthquake scaling laws - ScienceDirectA work flow is developed for modelling fault rupture using discrete bonded particle modelling.Discrete bonded particle modelling of fault activation near a nuclear waste repository site and comparison to static rupture earthquake scaling laws - ScienceDirectFault ruptures under various stress condition including future glaciation cycles simulated.Discrete bonded particle modelling of fault activation near a nuclear waste repository site and comparison to static rupture earthquake scaling laws - ScienceDirectFault rupture properties are compared with scaling relations of natural tectonic earthquakes and show good agreement.Discrete bonded particle modelling of fault activation near a nuclear waste repository site and comparison to static rupture earthquake scaling laws - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Post-traumatic psychological changes among survivors of the Lushan earthquake living in the most affected areas - ScienceDirectPost-traumatic psychological changes among survivors of the Lushan earthquake living in the most affected areas - ScienceDirectWe investigated the factors associated with positive psychological changes following the Lushan earthquake.Post-traumatic psychological changes among survivors of the Lushan earthquake living in the most affected areas - ScienceDirectWe investigated the factors associated with negative psychological changes following the Lushan earthquake.Post-traumatic psychological changes among survivors of the Lushan earthquake living in the most affected areas - ScienceDirectThe current analysis helps expand our knowledge of the psychological changes following an earthquake.Post-traumatic psychological changes among survivors of the Lushan earthquake living in the most affected areas - ScienceDirectThe primary objective of our study was to investigate both the negative and positive psychological changes following the Lushan earthquake, and to explore the factors associated with psychological changes.

For this objective, spatially varying ground motions in triple direction were produced for each support of the bridge considering the Mw=7.4 scenario earthquakes on the main Marmara Fault. In order to simulate the ground motions, modified stochastic finite-fault technique was utilized. Taking the ground motions into account, non-linear time-history analysis was carried out, and the results obtained from the analysis were compared to those from uniform support earthquake excitation to identify the effects of multi-point earthquake excitations on the seismic performance of the bridge. From the analysis, it was determined that modal response of the towers and the deck was mostly effective on dynamic response of the entire bridge rather than other structural elements, such as cable and approach viaduct. Compared to the results obtained from simple-point earthquake excitation, noticeable axial force increase in the cable elements was obtained under multi-point earthquake excitation. The changes at the main cable and the side span cable were determined as 21% and 18%, respectively. This much increase in the cable elements led to increase in axial force at the towers and in shear force at the base section of the tower column. These changes in the structural elements were closely related to response of the deck and the towers since they had considerable contribution to response of the entire bridge. Based on the findings from the study, spatially varying ground motions has to be considered for long span suspension bridges, and the multi-support earthquake analysis should be carried out for better understanding and obtaining reliable results necessary for retrofitting and performance evaluation.Response of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Suspension Bridge under spatially varying multi-point earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamic Ratcheting in SDOF hysteretic damping systems induced by earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectDynamic Ratcheting in SDOF hysteretic damping systems induced by earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectWhen DR occurs, plastic deformation increases asymmetrically in successive cycles.Dynamic Ratcheting in SDOF hysteretic damping systems induced by earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectNumerical simulation indicates that DR can occur under earthquake excitations.Dynamic Ratcheting in SDOF hysteretic damping systems induced by earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectThe likelihood of DR occurrence mainly depends on local site conditions.Dynamic Ratcheting in SDOF hysteretic damping systems induced by earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectDynamic Ratcheting in SDOF hysteretic damping systems induced by earthquake excitations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirect3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirectThe Phayao Fault Zone (PFZ) in Thailand is imaged via a 3-D magnetotelluric survey.3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirectThe shallow 3-D resistivity structure matches well with the surface geology.3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirectA deep conductor related to the saline fluid is observed beneath the PFZ.3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirectA high fault plane instability and saline fluid govern the slip of the PFZ.3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirect3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (139KB)Download full-size image3-D magnetotelluric imaging of the Phayao Fault Zone, Northern Thailand: Evidence for saline fluid in the source region of the 2014 Chiang Rai earthquake - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectPerformance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectMethodology for assessing performance limits of seismic isolation system design.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectSeismic actions on contents are explicitly considered in isolation system design.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectOptimum isolation system parameters required to satisfy a target performance limit.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectMay protect structural integrity under large magnitude near-field earthquakes.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectChallenging to protect equipment under large magnitude near field earthquakes.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectThe mission of seismic isolation is two folds: (i) protecting the integrity and (ii) protecting the contents of a structure by reducing floor accelerations to target limits and concurrently keeping base displacements below practical and economical limits. To this end, while seismic isolation has proven to be successful under far-field earthquakes, its success in case of near-field earthquakes is being questioned for over a decade now; the main reason being the threat of excessive base displacements due to the presence of long period large velocity pulses. Lowering isolation period and increasing isolation damping aiming to reduce base displacements unfortunately may result in a reduced seismic performance in terms of floor accelerations particularly under far-field earthquakes. And the success level of such a precaution under near-field earthquakes depends both on the fault-distance and the pulse period to the isolation period ratio. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance limits of buildings equipped with seismic isolation systems of different characteristics when subjected to near-field ground motions at different fault distances with different velocity pulse periods. Accordingly, a methodology for assessing the performance limit of a seismic isolation system design that explicitly considers the seismic actions on the contents of the superstructure in the near-field region is introduced. Benchmark buildings with base isolation systems of different isolation periods and characteristic force ratios are subjected to synthetically developed near-field earthquake records at different fault-distances with different velocity pulse periods and their seismic performances are reported.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Performance limits of seismically isolated buildings under near-field earthquakes - ScienceDirectTel.: +90 212 473 7000x17939; fax: +90 212 473 7176.Rediscussion on the geodynamics of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake: New seismic reflection evidence for crustal structure of the Longmenshan - ScienceDirectRediscussion on the geodynamics of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake: New seismic reflection evidence for crustal structure of the Longmenshan - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Remittance and earthquake preparedness - ScienceDirectNepal is located in a highly active seismic zone. This has been evident from the 7.8 magnitude tremor that was felt on April 25, 2015 with numerous aftershocks. In light of a lot of financial aid that started pouring in from numerous humanitarian organizations, the supports received from remittances have been largely forgotten. This research aims to determine the role of remittances in ex-ante disaster preparedness through the linkage between remittances and safer building practices. The primary source of information comes from two questionnaire surveys: (1) administered to migrant workers in Qatar and South Korea and (2) administered to remittance dependent and non-dependent households in Kathmandu valley and Jhapa. The study shows that there is a significant contribution of remittances in building construction practices. From the surveys conducted in Kathmandu valley and Jhapa, it is seen that remittance dependent households allocated 20% of remittance income received in last 12 months for construction practices. Similarly, migrant workers in South Korea and Qatar allocated 18.1% and 7% of remittances for construction purposes back home. In terms of ex ante preparedness, remittance dependent household have a statistically significant and positive impact on the ownership of concrete houses. In contrast, regarding use of engineer and awareness of building code for safe construction, the likelihood of the remittance contributing to better quality and strong house using engineer and awareness of building code for safe construction tends to decrease. Thus, the study shows that remittances are fueling unsafe construction practices in Nepal and increasing earthquake risk.Remittance and earthquake preparedness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquakes and active tectonics of the Himalayan convergent boundary - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Why so few?

Following the 2010 earthquake, the Earthquake Commission directed a thorough investigation of the ground profile in Christchurch, and to date, more than 7500 cone penetration tests (CPT) have been performed in the region. This paper presents the results of analyses which use a subset of the geotechnical database to evaluate the liquefaction process as well as the re-liquefaction that occurred following some of the major events in Christchurch. First, the applicability of existing CPT-based methods for evaluating liquefaction potential of Christchurch soils was investigated using three methods currently available. Next, the results of liquefaction potential evaluation were compared with the severity of observed damage, categorised in terms of the land damage grade developed from Tonkin & Taylor property inspections as well as from observed severity of liquefaction from aerial photography. For this purpose, the Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI) was used to represent the damage potential at each site. In addition, a comparison of the CPT-based strength profiles obtained before each of the major aftershocks was performed. The results suggest that the analysis of spatial and temporal variations of strength profiles gives a clear indication of the resulting liquefaction and re-liquefaction observed in Christchurch. The comparison of a limited number of CPT strength profiles before and after the earthquakes seems to indicate that no noticeable strengthening has occurred in Christchurch, making the area vulnerable to liquefaction induced land damage in future large-scale earthquakes.CPT-based analysis of liquefaction and re-liquefaction following the Canterbury earthquake sequence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Be proactive for better decisions: Predicting information seeking in the context of earthquake risk - ScienceDirectBe proactive for better decisions: Predicting information seeking in the context of earthquake risk - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectEarthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectEarthquake response of slender hollow intake-outlet tower is studied.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectTower is analyzed in anchored (fixed base) and unanchored (freestanding) states.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectIts foundation is allowed to uplift and slide on the underlying soil.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectWater-structure interaction is considered using Eulerian-Lagrangian approach.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectDetailed parametric study is conducted on several system characteristics.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectEarthquake response of solitary slender intake towers is investigated considering an idealized hollow intake tower with its circular footing submerged in water. The tower is studied in anchored (fixed base) and unanchored (freestanding) states placed on undeformable soil foundation. The water-structure interaction is modeled by the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, using the pressure-based elements for the water and the displacement-based elements for the structure. The only source of nonlinearity is the contact at the base joint between the tower's footing and the ground. This contact is modeled using Coulomb friction model which allows the tower to slide and uplift. The system is three-dimensionally analyzed using finite element method under static and dynamic earthquake loads. A detailed parametric study is conducted to assess the importance of system characteristics including surrounding and inside water levels, ratio of tower height to footing radius, base joint friction coefficient, water compressibility, footing flexibility, and vertical ground motion.Earthquake response of solitary slender freestanding intake towers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectGorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectPoor seismic performance of non-engineered structures are reported.Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectSeismic vulnerability assessment of various types of structures are discussed.Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectDifferent strengthening techniques are suggested.Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectModified RVS strategy is used.Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectA direction towards earthquake preparedness is attempted to be provided.Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015: Actual damage, retrofitting measures and prediction by RVS for a few typical structures - ScienceDirectThis study is an attempt to underline the lack of preparedness and the nature of immediate further measures to be taken for facing a moderate earthquake in Indian subcontinents.

Owing to structure irregularities, bridge reactions result from the interaction between the moment and torsion forces. Based on the solving of the seismic response of structure excited by a one-way earthquake input, a uniform expression of the unfavorable angle of the earthquake input was derived, and the corresponding maximum response of structure was determined. Considering the orthotropic and skewed dual-directional earthquake input manners, the most unfavorable angles for the two cases were also derived, respectively. Furthermore, a series finite element models were built to analyze the multi-component seismic responses by examining an example of curved girder bridge considering the variation of curvature radius and the bearings arrangement. The seismic responses of the case bridges, were excited by earthquakes at different input angles, and were calculated and analyzed using a response spectrum method. The input angles of earthquake excitation were progressively increased. From the analysis and comparison based on the calculation results mentioned above, the most unfavorable angle of earthquake excitation corresponding to the maximum seismic response of the curved bridge could be determined. It was shown that the most unfavorable angles of earthquake input resulted from the different response combination methods were essentially coherent.Influence of earthquake input angle on seismic response of curved girder bridge - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Periodical Offices of Chang'an University.Fast rupture propagation for large strike-slip earthquakes - ScienceDirectFast rupture propagation for large strike-slip earthquakes - ScienceDirectSystematically estimated average rupture speeds of recent large earthquakes.Fast rupture propagation for large strike-slip earthquakes - ScienceDirectDip-slip events have slow rupture speed.Fast rupture propagation for large strike-slip earthquakes - ScienceDirectLarge strike-slip earthquakes appear to have significant supershear rupture speed.Fast rupture propagation for large strike-slip earthquakes - ScienceDirectStudying rupture speeds of shallow earthquakes is of broad interest because it has a large effect on the strong near-field shaking that causes damage during earthquakes, and it is an important parameter that reflects stress levels and energy on a slipping fault.

Two major aftershocks (Mw 6.6 and Mw 6.7) followed the mainshock contributing to devastation in many villages in mountainous areas north of Kathmandu. This report summarizes geotechnical and structural damage features caused by the earthquake, which were observed during a field investigation conducted by a survey team dispatched by the Japan Geotechnical Society (JGS), the Asian Technical Committee of ISSMGE on Geotechnical Natural Hazards (ATC3) and the Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE). The post-earthquake damage survey was conducted in Kathmandu, Trishuli, Melamchi, Baluwa (epicentral area) and Pokhara from 1 to 6 May 2015. A significant damage to the historical architectures in the Durbar Square of Downtown Kathmandu was observed, while the damage to masonry structures in the surrounding area was limited. In mountainous areas including epicentral area, non-engineered masonry structures were severely damaged, and traces of medium to large scale landslides and rock falls were frequently observed. Dam embankment in Trishuli suffered from cracking at the reservoir side along its entire length. Such damages to the structures and slopes are posing risks of secondary disasters to the local residents. Based on the field survey, recommendations related to immediate policy following the earthquake and addressed to policy makers are made in the conclusion.Reconnaissance report on geotechnical and structural damage caused by the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake, Nepal - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of The Japanese Geotechnical Society.Reconnaissance report on geotechnical and structural damage caused by the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake, Nepal - ScienceDirectFormerly at Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.The 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectThe 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectA comprehensive 3D study to simulate ground motion during the 1915 Marsica earthquake.The 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectThe study of the spatial variability of near source ground motion features.The 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectIdentification of the best distance metric to study the decay of ground motion peak values.The 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectThe analysis of 3D vs 1D features of seismic site amplification.The 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectIn this paper we show 3D physics-based numerical simulations of ground motion during one of the most devastating earthquakes in the recent Italian history, occurred on Jan 13, 1915, Marsica, Central Italy. The results provide a realistic estimate of the earthquake ground motion and fit reasonably well both the geodetic measurements of permanent ground settlement, and the observed macroseismic distribution of damage. In addition, these results provide a very useful benchmark to improve the current knowledge of near-source earthquake ground motion, including evaluation of the best distance metrics to describe the spatial variability of the peak values of ground motion, the relative importance of fault normal vs fault parallel components, the conditions under which vertical ground motion may prevail, as well as the adequacy of 1D vs 3D modelling of site amplification effects.The 3D numerical simulation of near-source ground motion during the Marsica earthquake, central Italy, 100 years later - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Profile and procedures for fractures among 1323 fracture patients from the 2010 Yushu earthquake, China - ScienceDirectThe injuries caused by earthquakes are often complex and of various patterns.

China has a large number of children and adolescents, who tend to be most vulnerable because they are in an early stage of human development and possible post-traumatic psychological distress may have a life-long consequence. Trauma survivors without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have received little attention in previous studies, especially in event-related potential (ERP) studies. We compared the attention bias to threat stimuli between the earthquake-exposed group and the control group in a masked version of the dot probe task. The target probe presented at the same space location consistent with earthquake-related words was the congruent trial, while in the space location of neutral words was the incongruent trial. Thirteen earthquake-exposed middle school students without PTSD and 13 matched controls were included in this investigation. The earthquake-exposed group showed significantly faster RTs to congruent trials than to incongruent trials. The earthquake-exposed group produced significantly shorter C1 and P1 latencies and larger C1, P1 and P2 amplitudes than the control group. In particular, enhanced P1 amplitude to threat stimuli was observed in the earthquake-exposed group. These findings are in agreement with the prediction that earthquake-exposed survivors have an attention bias to threat stimuli. The traumatic event had a much greater effect on earthquake-exposed survivors even if they showed no PTSD symptoms than individuals in the controls. These results will provide neurobiological evidences for effective intervention and prevention to post-traumatic mental problems.Attention bias in earthquake-exposed survivors: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Attention bias in earthquake-exposed survivors: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Preliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectPreliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectFrequency dependent attenuation of strong motion from Vrancea earthquakes.Preliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectExtension of Yugoslav scaling equations for PSV Spectra to Vrancea sources.Preliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectPreliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectTests of empirical PSV Spectra at long and short periods.Preliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectPreliminary empirical scaling of pseudo relative velocity spectra in Serbia from the Vrancea earthquakes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Response simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectResponse simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectNew model for 1D non-linear dynamic analysis of hybrid base isolation systems.Response simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectCompact analytical solution for the proposed model.Response simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectParameter identification from free vibration tests using evolutionary strategies.Response simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectSimulation of response under initial displacement, harmonic and earthquake excitation.Response simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectResponse simulation of hybrid base isolation systems under earthquake excitation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Magnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectMagnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectSeveral cm-thick magnetic mineral anomalies are observed close to rupture zone.Magnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectThe anomaly is induced by large earthquake, not controlled by kinds of fault rocks.Magnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectMagnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectCharacteristic of YBF control the thermal pressurization earthquake fault mechanism.Magnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectMagnetic mineral characterization close to the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault surface rupture zone of the Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9, 2008) and its implication for earthquake slip processes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Joint earthquake and wave action on the monopile wind turbine foundation: An experimental study - ScienceDirectJoint earthquake and wave action on the monopile wind turbine foundation: An experimental study - ScienceDirectOffshore wind turbines in regions of active seismicity are subjected to the potential threat caused by the joint earthquake and ocean wave action.

Taking NREL-5MW monopile wind turbine as the prototype, this study is devoted to probe the joint action of strong earthquakes and moderate sea conditions. A series of shake table model tests of scale 30:1 have been carried out by the contemporary world unique facility (Earthquake, Wave and Current Joint Simulation System) to investigate the structural response in dry flume, low and high calm water levels, with and without regular or random waves. Particular interest has been in the nacelle acceleration subjected to strong ground motions as well as to random waves. The experimental results of nacelle peak accelerations and corresponding dynamic amplification factors show that the joint earthquake and wave action is important for the proper evaluation of structural response. Ignoring the effect of wave action in seismic analysis will lead to underestimation of structural response, especially when the monopile foundation is dynamically sensitive. The coupling of earthquake and wave actions is sourced not only from the relative velocity of vibration but also from the initial condition induced by waves. It has been also derived that the peak acceleration excited by a moderate sea condition is comparable to that by a moderate earthquake.Joint earthquake and wave action on the monopile wind turbine foundation: An experimental study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gravity variations before the Menyuan Ms6.4 earthquake - ScienceDirectGravity variations before the Menyuan Ms6.4 earthquake - ScienceDirectWeifeng Liang, senior engineer in the second monitoring and application center, China Earthquake Administration.
