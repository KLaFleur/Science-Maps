The official discourses, mission and vision statements of the 21 most visible online music ventures were analyzed using mixed methods to capture the representations of the digital music industry of the entrepreneurs at their helm. The managerial cognition of digital music entrepreneurs challenges all the dominant logics and industry recipes of the traditional music industry and encounters no cognitive barriers. The cognitive frame of the value chain remains prevalent however in the representations of digital music entrepreneurs, and restrains them from embracing the specificities of the creative industries.Managerial cognition and the value chain in the digital music industry - ScienceDirectAllègre L.

Music exposure can enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression level in dorsal hippocampus (DH) and thus enhance spatial cognition ability. But whether music experience may affect different subregions of DH in the same degree remains unclear. Here, we studied the effects of exposure to Mozart K.448 on learning behavior in developing rats using the classical Morris water maze task. The results showed that early music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of the rats in the water maze test. Meanwhile, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA3 (dCA3) and dentate gyrus (dDG) was significantly enhanced in rats exposed to Mozart music as compared to those without music exposure. In contrast, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) was not affected. The results suggest that the spatial memory improvement by music exposure in rats may be associated with the enhanced BDNF/TrkB level of dCA3 and dDG.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectNegative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectWe investigated the association between salivary testosterone level and music preference.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectThe analysis revealed a negative correlation between testosterone level and the preference for sophisticated music.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectThe association between testosterone level and music preference was not mediated by big-five personality.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectMusic constitutes an integral part of everyday life. There is great variation in preference patterns for music. However, the cause of such individual differences has not been fully elucidated to date. Many behavioral traits, including personality, are known to be influenced by steroid-hormone testosterone. On this basis, we conjectured that testosterone partly determines individual differences in music preference. To examine this hypothesis, in the present study, we investigated the association between salivary testosterone concentration and strength of preference for five different music types in young males and females. The results revealed a significant negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music, such as classical and jazz in males. This relationship was not mediated by the big-five personality traits. These findings indicate the possibility that neuroendocrinological function can exert influences on music preference patterns.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectComplexity measures of music - ScienceDirectWe address the issue of detecting the crucial events in music by analyzing the volume change of a music piece.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectIt is found that multifractality of the Mozart piece performed by human is broader than the one played by computer.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectThe power spectrum confirms the existence of 1/f noise in studied music pieces.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectWe present a technique to search for the presence of crucial events in music, based on the analysis of the music volume. Earlier work on this issue was based on the assumption that crucial events correspond to the change of music notes, with the interesting result that the complexity index of the crucial events is μ ≈ 2, which is the same inverse power-law index of the dynamics of the brain. The search technique analyzes music volume and confirms the results of the earlier work, thereby contributing to the explanation as to why the brain is sensitive to music, through the phenomenon of complexity matching. Complexity matching has recently been interpreted as the transfer of multifractality from one complex network to another. For this reason we also examine the mulifractality of music, with the observation that the multifractal spectrum of a computer performance is significantly narrower than the multifractal spectrum of a human performance of the same musical score. We conjecture that although crucial events are demonstrably important for information transmission, they alone are not sufficient to define musicality, which is more adequately measured by the multifractality spectrum.A gray matter of taste: Sound perception, music cognition, and Baumgarten’s aesthetics - ScienceDirectMusic is an ancient and ubiquitous form of human expression. One important component for which music is sought after is its aesthetic value, whose appreciation has typically been associated with largely learned, culturally determined factors, such as education, exposure, and social pressure. However, neuroscientific evidence shows that the aesthetic response to music is often associated with automatic, physically- and biologically-grounded events, such as shivers, chills, increased heart rate, and motor synchronization, suggesting the existence of an underlying biological platform upon which contextual factors may act. Drawing on philosophical notions and neuroscientific evidence, I argue that, although there is no denying that social and cultural context play a substantial role in shaping the aesthetic response to music, these act upon largely universal, biological mechanisms involved with neural processing. I propose that the simultaneous presence of culturally-influenced and biologically-determined contributions to the aesthetic response to music epitomizes Baumgarten’s equation of sensory perception with taste. Taking the argument one step further, I suggest that the heavily embodied aesthetic response to music bridges the cleavage between the two discrepant meanings—the one referring to sensory perception, the other referring to judgments of taste—traditionally attributed to the word “aesthetics” in the sciences and the humanities.A gray matter of taste: Sound perception, music cognition, and Baumgarten’s aesthetics - ScienceDirect► The aesthetic appreciation of art depends on learned, culturally determined factors. ► The aesthetic response to music is associated with automatic, physical events. ► Coexistence of cultural and physical factors epitomizes Baumgarten’s theory of taste. ► Music reconciliates scientific and humanistic meanings of the word “aesthetics”.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectWe investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular on-demand music streaming services.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectOur study resulted into two variants, differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method, NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second method, NeuroPicksVQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectBeyond the feature engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems, while NeuroPicksVQ can control the selection of music tracks. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the systems, are presented.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectFotis P.

The effects of in-store music in service settings - ScienceDirectManagers believe that in-store music has positive effects on customers' responses; consequently, it is widely used in different service settings such as supermarkets and coffee shops. However, prior research shows inconclusive results about the effects of in-store music – namely positive, non-significant and even negative effects. To shed more light on the actual effects of in-store music, the authors provide a systematic literature review of journal articles to explore such effects in six frequently studied service settings: supermarkets, retail, restaurants, bars, cafeterias and banks. The present literature review has three objectives. First, the authors develop a conceptual framework to provide structure and guidance to the research stream about in-store music in service settings. Second, the authors take a closer look at the existence of in-store music (i.e., whether the presence of in-store music helps, has no effect, or ‘hurts’) as well as on the design of in-store music for each service setting separately (i.e., how in-store music has to be designed to have beneficial effects). Third, after elaborating the status quo (what do we know?), this review identifies areas for future research (what do we need to know?).Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectThis study describes the effects of active music therapy (AMT) on cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectA single case study investigated different cognitive and psycho-behavioural changes after AMT.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectAn adult patient with memory, attention, and verbal fluency deficits associated with Vascular Cognitive Impairment-No Dementia (VCI-ND) was treated.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectA four-months AMT course was based on creative and interactive music playing. Sixteen sessions were conducted simultaneously to the pharmacological therapy.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectCognitive performances, mood, interpersonal interactions, and perceived abilities were assessed using standardized neuropsychological and psycho-behavioural measurements.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectAt baseline, the patient reported a tendency to feel tense, nervous, and angry and difficulties in memory and visuospatial performances, frequently accompanied by attention drops. The social network was a habitual component of the patient's life, but not a source of sharing of personal experiences, safety or comfort. Neuropsychological tests showed deficits in object and figure naming, verbal fluency, short and long-term verbal memory, short-term spatial memory, selective attention, and visuomotor coordination. After AMT, the cognitive profile significantly improved in attention, visuomotor coordination, and verbal and spatial memory. Such positive changes were confirmed at the three-months follow-up. An increase of the interpersonal interactions and consistent reduction of anxiety were also observed.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectIn selected patients with VCI-ND, a well-structured AMT intervention added to standard therapy may contribute in determining a stable improvement of cognitive and psycho-behavioural aspects. Controlled studies are needed to confirm these promising results.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectThese authors equally contributed to this work.The joy of heartfelt music: An examination of emotional and physiological responses - ScienceDirectThe joy of heartfelt music: An examination of emotional and physiological responses - ScienceDirectMusic chosen by the listener was most effective for short-term mood enhancement.The joy of heartfelt music: An examination of emotional and physiological responses - ScienceDirectClassical music most often induced a subjective and physiological state of relaxation.The joy of heartfelt music: An examination of emotional and physiological responses - ScienceDirectRelationships between subjective and physiological responses were complex.The joy of heartfelt music: An examination of emotional and physiological responses - ScienceDirectMusic-listening has great potential to rehabilitate mood, and thus enhance wellbeing and quality of life.The joy of heartfelt music: An examination of emotional and physiological responses - ScienceDirectMusic-listening can be a powerful therapeutic tool for mood rehabilitation, yet quality evidence for its validity as a singular treatment is scarce. Specifically, the relationship between music-induced mood improvement and meaningful physiological change, as well as the influence of music- and person-related covariates on these outcomes are yet to be comprehensively explored. Ninety-four healthy participants completed questionnaires probing demographics, personal information, and musical background. Participants listened to two prescribed musical pieces (one classical, one jazz), an “uplifting” piece of their own choice, and an acoustic control stimulus (white noise) in randomised order. Physiological responses (heart rate, respiration, galvanic skin response) were recorded throughout. After each piece, participants rated their subjective responses on a series of Likert scales. Subjectively, the self-selected pieces induced the most joy, and the classical piece was perceived as most relaxing, consistent with the arousal ratings proposed by a music selection panel. These two stimuli led to the greatest overall improvement in composite emotional state from baseline. Psycho-physiologically, self-selected pieces often elicited a “eustress” response (“positive arousal”), whereas classical music was associated with the highest heart rate variability. Very few person-related covariates appeared to affect responses, and music-related covariates (besides self-selection) appeared arbitrary. These data provide strong evidence that optimal music for therapy varies between individuals. Our findings additionally suggest that the self-selected music was most effective for inducing a joyous state; while low arousal classical music was most likely to shift the participant into a state of relaxation. Therapy should attempt to find the most effective and “heartfelt” music for each listener, according to therapeutic goals.Musical friends and foes: The social cognition of affiliation and control in improvised interactions - ScienceDirectA recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production, but also in its perception, i.e. that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social relations between a group of real or virtual agents. While this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena, such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial behaviour or between strong musical emotions and empathy, direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention. We created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of non-musical social intentions, such as being domineering, disdainful or conciliatory, to one another solely using musical interaction. Using a combination of decoding studies, computational and psychoacoustical analyses, we show that both musically-trained and non musically-trained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music, and that this social cognitive ability relies, to a sizeable extent, on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians’ channels, but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction. By manipulating these cues in two-channel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of non-musician observers, we finally establish a causal relationship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand, and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination on the other hand. These results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions, but also into that of non-verbal interactions as a whole.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectDevelopmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWe conducted the first study on the development of music in Williams syndrome.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectSeveral pitch-related music skills were related to specific cognitive processes.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectDifferent markers of atypical development were identified.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThe results provide evidence against views on innate modularity for music in WS.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThe study of music cognition in Williams syndrome (WS) has resulted in theoretical debates regarding cognitive modularity and development. However, no research has previously investigated the development of music skills in this population. In this study, we used the cross-sectional developmental trajectories approach to assess the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Thus, we evaluated the role of change over time on pitch-related music skills and the developmental relationships between music skills and different cognitive areas. In the TD children, the pitch-related music skills improved with chronological age and cognitive development. In the children with WS, developmental relationships were only found between several pitch-related music skills and specific cognitive processes. We also found non-systematic relationships between chronological age and the pitch-related music skills, stabilization in the level reached in music when cognitive development was considered, and uneven associations between cognitive and music skills. In addition, the TD and WS groups differed in their patterns of pitch-related music skill development. These results suggest that the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS is atypical. Our findings stand in contrast with the views that claim innate modularity for music in WS; rather, they are consistent with neuroconstructivist accounts.Mozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectWe explore a possibility that the ‘Mozart effect’ points to a fundamental cognitive function of music. Would such an effect of music be due to the hedonicity, a fundamental dimension of mental experience? The present paper explores a recent hypothesis that music helps to tolerate cognitive dissonances and thus enabled accumulation of knowledge and human cultural evolution. We studied whether the influence of music is related to its hedonicity and whether pleasant or unpleasant music would influence scholarly test performance and cognitive dissonance. Specific hypotheses evaluated in this study are that during a test students experience contradictory cognitions that cause cognitive dissonances. If some music helps to tolerate cognitive dissonances, then first, this music should increase the duration during which participants can tolerate stressful conditions while evaluating test choices. Second, this should result in improved performance. These hypotheses are tentatively confirmed in the reported experiments as the agreeable music was correlated with longer duration of tests under stressful conditions and better performance above that under indifferent or unpleasant music. It follows that music likely performs a fundamental cognitive function explaining the origin and evolution of musical ability that have been considered a mystery.Mozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirect► Music helps overcoming cognitive dissonance and hold contradictory knowledge. ► This might be fundamental for human evolution and ability to think. ► The ‘Mozart effect’ might be caused by overcoming cognitive dissonance. ► Students reduce thinking time during stressful tests, but music reverses this. ► A ‘mystery of music’ might be due to overcoming cognitive dissonance.Music Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectChallenges of changing society presuppose the situation of music education, which requires a closer interaction between music culture and education that encourages learners to remain in contact with music environment approximate to school learners, to employ possibilities provided by popular music to expand exposure to music education and personality becoming. The article discusses opportunities of music education improvement integrating popular music and using innovative methods of personal meaning and emotional imitation in the context of theories of pedagogical thought. On the basis of the research results, the links of school learners’ musicals activities and formation of value-based attitudes as well as opportunities of improvement in contemporary school are discussed.Music Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectWe examined effects of more vs. less time in kindergarten general music.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with stronger executive functions.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with more positive attitudes about self and school.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectPrior research has suggested an association between increased musical training and extra-musical outcomes, but these studies are primarily correlational, focused on instrumental music, and provide limited information about the type of musical intervention. In the current study, we perform the first randomized controlled study investigating whether more time in general music in kindergarten results in better executive functioning, self-perception, and attitudes towards school. Control students received an average of 45 min of general music class per week while treatment students received 2–7 times more minutes per week. Both control and treatment students had applied to attend a school or program of intensive general music study serving primarily low-income students. Analyses from end-of-kindergarten data revealed no significant group differences on our outcome measures. Results fail to show an association between increased time spent in general music learning and stronger extra-musical outcomes.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectThis research was supported by the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the National Endowment for the Arts [16-3800-7003].

Such phenomenal states are difficult to grasp objectively. We investigated the state of musical absorption by using eye tracking. We utilized a load related definition of state absorption: multimodal resources are committed to create a unified representation of music. Resource allocation was measured indirectly by microsaccade rate, known to indicate cognitive processing load. We showed in Exp. 1 that microsaccade rate also indicates state absorption. Hence, there is cross-modal coupling between an auditory aesthetic experience and fixational eye movements. When removing the fixational stimulus in Exp. 2, saccades are no longer generated upon visual input and the cross-modal coupling disappeared. Results are interpreted in favor of the load hypothesis of microsaccade rate and against the assumption of general slowing by state absorption.Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures? A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectBurn wound care procedures are very painful and lead to distress. Live music therapy has shown beneficial effects on distress and pain in specific pediatric patient populations. In this study we measured whether live music therapy has beneficial effects in terms of less distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures.Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures? A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectThis randomized assessor-blinded controlled trial (RCT) took place at the burns unit of the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. It included newly admitted inpatients between the ages of 0 and 13 years undergoing their first or second wound care procedures. Excluded were children with a hearing impairment or low level of consciousness. The intervention group received one live music therapy session directly after wound care in addition to standard care. The control group received standard care only. The primary outcome was distress measured with the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-revised (OSBD-r). The secondary outcome was pain measured with the COMFORT-behavioral scale (COMFORT-B). In addition, in children older than 5 years self-reported distress with the validated Wong-Baker scale (FACES) and pain with the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) were measured. Patients in both groups were videotaped for three minutes before wound care; during the music therapy or the control condition; and for two minutes thereafter. Two researchers, blinded to the study condition, independently scored the OSBD-r and the COMFORT-B from the video footage before and after music therapy.Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures? A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectWe included 135 patients, median age 22.6 months (IQR 15.4–40.7 months). Change scores did not significantly differ between the intervention and the control groups for either distress (p = 0.53; d = 0.11; 95% CI −0.23 to 0.45) or pain (p = 0.99; d = 0.04; 95% CI −0.30 to 0.38). Self-reported distress in a small group of children (n = 18) older than 5 years indicated a significant reduction in distress after live music therapy (p = 0.05).Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures?

There is scant evidence on the origins of these two conditions in student populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and developmental trajectory of MPA and perfectionism in a population of school age children. A sample of 526 students (male n = 291; female n = 235) across Grades 5–12 at a private school on the outskirts of Melbourne, Victoria were administered two questionnaires, the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory for Adolescents (MPAI-A; Osborne & Kenny, 2005) which measures the somatic, cognitive and behavioural components of MPA, and the Child Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (C-MPS; DeKryger, 2005). The C-MPS measures the multidimensional components of perfectionism in children, such as Concern over Mistakes, Organisation, Parental Expectations, and Doubts about Actions. The correlation between MPA and perfectionism by age showed a consistently strong, positive and highly significant relationship from 10 through to 17 years of age, particularly for Concern over Mistakes. The second significant relationship between MPA and perfectionism applied to gender, with females experiencing a steeper and more intense developmental trajectory than males. The third important finding of the research was that levels of MPA and perfectionism increase with years of experience. This study has implications for teachers and psychologists working with young students of music.Role of executive attention in consumer learning with background music - ScienceDirectThis paper examines how the type of background music (vocal vs. instrumental) affects consumers' cognitive performance depending on individual differences in executive attention (i.e., working memory capacity). Across three experiments, we find that vocal music leads to poorer cognitive and attitudinal outcomes for consumers lower in working memory capacity but does not affect those higher in working memory capacity. However, short-term habituation to background music helps mitigate this negative effect of vocal music on consumer ad recall. Finally, consumer performances on computing discount prices are also affected by music type depending upon whether prices are communicated in verbal or numeric form. Overall, this research lays out an executive-attention based process mechanism explaining when and how background music shapes consumer learning and memory. The outlined theory enriches the literature on music effects as well as immediate-term learning by explicating the role of selective attention in the processing of multi-modal marketing stimuli.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectGuided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMusic and imagery was used for management of PTSD symptoms in women who had experienced Military Sexual Trauma.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectParticipants used music to regulate emotions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectImagery was a learned resource for grounding.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectEffects carried over between sessions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectThree out of four participants scored clinically significant reductions and one out of four scored a reliable reduction of PTSD symptoms.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMilitary Sexual Trauma (MST) is an issue among returning veterans that causes a significant amount of distress with a high occurrence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Moreover, several reports have discovered that brain hemisphericity tends to increase with professional experience. Some specialists have associated music with right hemisphericity although the fact has never been clearly demonstrated. The present study aims to explore the link between the brain hemisphericity and success in the musical domain by investigating undergraduate music students and philharmonic musicians. The research questions are: Is music performance level influenced by hemisphericity? Does hemisphericity increase over time as a result of professional music experience? One hundred and thirty music undergraduate and 47 philharmonic performers joined the study. All participants specialized in either vocal or instrumental classical music performance. The professional musicians have worked in the philharmonic for 5 up to 30 years (mean=10 years), resulting in a significant difference in music performance experience between the two experimental groups. All the subjects have completed The Hemispheric Mode Indicator (McCarthy, 1993) that demonstrated a reliability quotient of 0.81 for the translated and adapted Romanian version. Students’ level of music performance was assessed by documenting the grades they obtained during their annual music performance exams. Students with right hemisphericity revealed a significant higher level of music performance (t=0.66, p=0.04). Most of the students (except for the pianists) were right-brain oriented. The philharmonic performers showed a more accentuated left hemisphericity. The results indicate that experience in music performance tends to create a shift from right to left hemisphericity.Brain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectExamining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectSkilled musicians performed sustained attention tasks in different domains.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectParticipants were tested using tasks requiring temporal and visual discrimination.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectMusicians outperformed controls in the temporal discrimination task only.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectThe general ability to attend to temporal intervals may be enhanced in individuals with music training.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectWhile many aspects of cognition have been investigated in relation to skilled music training, surprisingly little work has examined the connection between music training and attentional abilities. The present study investigated the performance of skilled musicians on cognitively demanding sustained attention tasks, measuring both temporal and visual discrimination over a prolonged duration. Participants with extensive formal music training were found to have superior performance on a temporal discrimination task, but not a visual discrimination task, compared to participants with no music training. In addition, no differences were found between groups in vigilance decrement in either type of task. Although no differences were evident in vigilance per se, the results indicate that performance in an attention-demanding temporal discrimination task was superior in individuals with extensive music training. We speculate that this basic cognitive ability may contribute to advantages that musicians show in other cognitive measures.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectAddress: 3026 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, United States.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectNeural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectPianists imitated or listened to chord sequences with harmonic violations in fMRI.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectfMRI and rfMRI-connectivity showed dorsal motor and ventral audio streams for music.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectRight IFG is likely to integrate harmonic information in motor and audio format.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectParietal/temporal areas may be tied to motoric and auditory knowledge of harmony.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectThe ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.Tracting the neural basis of music: Deficient structural connectivity underlying acquired amusia - ScienceDirectAcquired amusia provides a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental neural architectures of musical processing due to the transition from a functioning to defective music processing system. Yet, the white matter (WM) deficits in amusia remain systematically unexplored. To evaluate which WM structures form the neural basis for acquired amusia and its recovery, we studied 42 stroke patients longitudinally at acute, 3-month, and 6-month post-stroke stages using DTI [tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and deterministic tractography (DT)] and the Scale and Rhythm subtests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA). Non-recovered amusia was associated with structural damage and subsequent degeneration in multiple WM tracts including the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and frontal aslant tract (FAT), as well as in the corpus callosum (CC) and its posterior part (tapetum). In a linear regression analysis, the volume of the right IFOF was the main predictor of MBEA performance across time. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the large-scale deficits in intra- and interhemispheric structural connectivity underlying amusia, and conversely highlight which pathways are crucial for normal music perception.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectThe appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectSad music is listened to more commonly in sad moods and negative situations.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectMotivations for listening to sad music include validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectListening to sad music might be particularly helpful when people are experiencing negative life events.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectListening to sad music may be more adaptive for psychologically healthy people who are also more like to apply healthy coping strategies.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectDepressed individuals and ruminators use sad music both adaptively and maladaptive.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectAfter happiness, sadness is the most common emotion attributed to music. A recent proliferation of research has provided intense focus on the reasons why sad music is so popular. The research presented in this paper aims to summarize the results of recent studies. The findings indicate that many people report that they choose to listen to sad music when experiencing sadness, and after experiencing negative events. A range of motivations have been found as to why people choose to listen to sad music, these include the role of music in; validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation. For people who listen to sad music as an adaptive way to cope, some evidence in this review indicates that this may be a healthy strategy more applicable for psychologically healthy people, rather than those who are depressed or anxious. Findings indicate that depressed individuals, and ruminators, can use sad music adaptively, but also maladaptively. Sad music has also been shown to provide support when people are experiencing negative life events, as it enables the expression, identification, and understanding of the situation, which in turn aids the experience of consolation, and, ultimately, acceptance coping. Future directions for research, and the potential uses of sad music listening in therapeutic settings are discussed.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectMusic therapy is one of the types of active ageing programmes which are offered to elderly people. The usefulness of this programme in the field of dementia is beginning to be recognised by the scientific community, since studies have reported physical, cognitive, and psychological benefits. Further studies detailing the changes resulting from the use of music therapy with Alzheimer patients are needed.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectTo determine the clinical improvement profile of Alzheimer patients who have undergone music therapy.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectForty-two patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) underwent music therapy for 6 weeks.

We examined the mediating role of daydreams and the moderating function of personality differences for the emotional response to music by using a moderated mediation approach. The results showed that the valence of daydreams played a mediating role in the reaction to the musical experience: happy music was related to more positive daydreams, which were associated with greater relaxation with the happy music and to greater liking of the happy music. Furthermore, negative affect (trait) moderated the direct effect of sad vs. happy music on the liking of the music: individuals with high scores on negative affect preferred sad music. The results are discussed with regard to the interplay of general and personality-specific processes as it is relevant to better understand the effects music can have on the listeners.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectPerception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectWe examined the processing of hierarchical boundaries in natural music by EEG.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectMusical excerpts were presented to musicians and non-musicians.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectPerception of hierarchical boundaries in music is modulated by musical expertise.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectMusicians establish a hierarchical representation of musical structure at different timescales.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectNon-musicians process musical boundaries in a different and less clear way.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectHierarchical structure with units of different timescales is a key feature of music. For the perception of such structures, the detection of each boundary is crucial. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we explore the perception of hierarchical boundaries in music, and test whether musical expertise modifies such processing. Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.Critical Thinking and Music Education - ScienceDirectFor decades critical thinking was seen as a skill that had to be developed in every educational context. Therefore, developing this ability became a principal issue for many educators and researchers. A great deal of research was carried out to reveal what fosters this ability and how it is fostered. Besides, the increasing interest in critical thinking popularized the question of how critical thinking could be adapted to other disciplines. In this study, the relationship between critical thinking and music education will be investigated. Hence the purpose of this study is to review the effects of music education on the students’ critical thinking abilities in the light of literature. In addition, the teachers’ role of guiding students to achieve critical thinking will be discussed. Finally, how to foster the critical thinking abilities of music students in the context of music education will be questioned and some suggestions will be made about the development of music students’ critical thinking skills.Critical Thinking and Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and/or peer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectPast research has demonstrated that music often negatively impacts performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, including academically relevant tasks. There are, however, discrepancies in the literature, including a handful of instances where no effect of music was observed. We tested the novel hypothesis that working-memory capacity moderated the detrimental effect of music on academic performance. Undergraduate students worked on reading-comprehension and math tasks under both music and silence conditions before completing a battery of working-memory capacity assessments. Although music led to a significant decline in performance overall, working-memory capacity moderated this effect in the reading-comprehension tasks. These findings suggest that individuals who are better able to control their attention (as indexed by working-memory capacity) may be protected from music-related distraction when completing certain kinds of academically relevant tasks.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectAuthor NoteGenetic algorithms for music variation on genom platform - ScienceDirectThis paper considers the problems of algorithmic music variations and modeling of musical creativity in general with a help of genetic algorithms. The proposed model of algorithmic musical variations with genetic algorithms is based on analysis and adaptation of ideas about algorithmic musical variations provided by R. Kh. Zaripov. Implementation of created model is based on Genom software, the platform for experiments in modeling of musical creativity with genetic algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed model can be used to create simple musical variations. The practical application of this system lies in interactive help for composer in creationof various musical ideas for further development. Several experimental results are shown in a form of musical scores.Music chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectMusic chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectMusic chills are bodily responses corresponding to peak emotional experiences.Music chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectChills are reported more frequently for self-selected songs than songs selected by others.Music chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectPupil size was larger within specific time-windows around the chill events.Music chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectPupil size increase both in an active (key response) and passive (simply listening) conditions.Music chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectA neuromodulatory role of the central norepinephrine system is implicated in this phenomenon.Music chills: The eye pupil as a mirror to music’s soul - ScienceDirectThis study evaluated whether music-induced aesthetic “chill” responses, which typically correspond to peak emotional experiences, can be objectively monitored by degree of pupillary dilation. Participants listened to self-chosen songs versus control songs chosen by other participants. The experiment included an active condition where participants made key presses to indicate when experiencing chills and a passive condition (without key presses). Chills were reported more frequently for self-selected songs than control songs. Pupil diameter was concurrently measured by an eye-tracker while participants listened to each of the songs. Pupil size was larger within specific time-windows around the chill events, as monitored by key responses, than in comparison to pupil size observed during ‘passive’ song listening. In addition, there was a clear relationship between pupil diameter within the chills-related time-windows during both active and passive conditions, thus ruling out the possibility that chills-related pupil dilations were an artifact of making a manual response. These findings strongly suggest that music chills can be visible in the moment-to-moment changes in the size of pupillary responses and that a neuromodulatory role of the central norepinephrine system is thereby implicated in this phenomenon.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectThe nervous system works like a great orchestra. Specifically, the music of Mozart with its “Mozart effect” is appropriate to use in neurosurgery. We investigated the relationship between Mozart's music and neurosurgery.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectWe used digital catalogs like “PubMed” and the libraries of universities. Key words were “Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart” and “neurosurgery and music.”Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectIn the first half of the 20th century, performing neurosurgery on some musicians, such as Maurice Ravel, Josef Hassid, and George Gershwin, resulted in a fatal outcome. The cause of this is probably that neurosurgery had not been developed yet in the first half of the 20th century. In the past 3 decades, the neurosurgical operations of musicians show that musicians have rich associations among auditory, somatic, and sensorial systems.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectIt is clear that we have much to learn from studies about music and brain function that derive from our surgical experiences with patients. The neuronal plasticity of musicians' brains may be different from that of nonmusicians' brains. Musicians with enhanced motor skills have greater capacity for plasticity because of enriched interhemispheric connections. Listening to music and the effect of Mozart in neurosurgical practice, intensive care, or rehabilitation were documented in many studies. As authors, we mean something different: Its effectiveness should be studied. We concluded that in current neurosurgical practice, Mozart has an effect. More research and clinical studies are needed.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectThe role of auditory perception for cycling safety is explored.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMusic and phone conversation negatively affect perception of traffic sounds.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectNo impact of music or phone conversation on cyclists’ involvement in traffic incidents.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectCyclists compensate for listening to music and talking on the phone.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMajority of cyclists never or seldom encounter quiet (electric) cars on the road.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectListening to music or talking on the phone while cycling as well as the growing number of quiet (electric) cars on the road can make the use of auditory cues challenging for cyclists. The present study examined to what extent and in which traffic situations traffic sounds are important for safe cycling. Furthermore, the study investigated the potential safety implications of limited auditory information caused by quiet (electric) cars and by cyclists listening to music or talking on the phone. An Internet survey among 2249 cyclists in three age groups (16–18, 30–40 and 65–70 year old) was carried out to collect information on the following aspects: 1) the auditory perception of traffic sounds, including the sounds of quiet (electric) cars; 2) the possible compensatory behaviours of cyclists who listen to music or talk on their mobile phones; 3) the possible contribution of listening to music and talking on the phone to cycling crashes and incidents. Age differences with respect to those three aspects were analysed. Results show that listening to music and talking on the phone negatively affects perception of sounds crucial for safe cycling. However, taking into account the influence of confounding variables, no relationship was found between the frequency of listening to music or talking on the phone and the frequency of incidents among teenage cyclists. This may be due to cyclists’ compensating for the use of portable devices. Listening to music or talking on the phone whilst cycling may still pose a risk in the absence of compensatory behaviour or in a traffic environment with less extensive and less safe cycling infrastructure than the Dutch setting. With the increasing number of quiet (electric) cars on the road, cyclists in the future may also need to compensate for the limited auditory input of these cars.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music (e.g., Chinese, Indian) increased the recall of menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music increased the likelihood of choosing menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectClassical music increased willingness to pay for products related to social identity.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCountry music increased willingness to pay for utilitarian products.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic congruity effects on consumer behavior are conceptualized in terms of cognitive priming of semantic networks in memory, and operationalized as congruent with a product's country of origin (Experiment 1), or congruent with the utilitarian (Experiment 2) or social identity (Experiments 2 and 3) connotations of a product. Hearing a specific genre of music (e.g., classical) activates related concepts in memory (e.g., expensive, sophisticated, formal, educated), which influences the memory for, perception of, and choice of products. Consistent with this account of music congruity effects, three laboratory experiments show that playing music of a specific genre during initial product exposure improved subsequent recall of conceptually related (i.e., congruent) products compared to unrelated products (Experiment 1), affected product choice in favor of congruent products (Experiment 1), and affected how much participants were willing to pay for congruent products (Experiments 2 and 3).Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 7867.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 9279.Cross-cultural music cognition: cognitive methodology applied to North Sami yoiks - ScienceDirectThis article is a study of melodic expectancy in North Sami yoiks, a style of music quite distinct from Western tonal music. Three different approaches were taken. The first approach was a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of 18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identified style characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two reference pitches, the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations (for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, T. (1997). Self-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer). One model was trained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral experiment including the correct continuation tone, while another was trained with a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The convergence of the three approaches showed that both listeners and the SOM model are influenced by the statistical distributions of tones and tone sequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided evidence supporting a core set of psychological principles underlying melody formation whose relative weights appear to differ across musical styles.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectBrain signals are recorded using EEG headset while listening to audio music.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectFour different emotions are recognized using hybrid features of EEG signals.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectEmotion recognition accuracy is analyzed for three different age groups.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectThe relationship between music genres and human emotions is examined.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition using brain signals is an active research topic in the field of affective computing. Music is considered as a powerful tool for arousing emotions in human beings. This study recognized happy, sad, love and anger emotions in response to audio music tracks from electronic, rap, metal, rock and hiphop genres. Participants were asked to listen to audio music tracks of 1 min for each genre in a noise free environment. The main objectives of this study were to determine the effect of different genres of music on human emotions and indicating age group that is more responsive to music. Thirty men and women of three different age groups (15–25 years, 26–35 years and 36–50 years) underwent through the experiment that also included self reported emotional state after listening to each type of music. Features from three different domains i.e., time, frequency and wavelet were extracted from recorded EEG signals, which were further used by the classifier to recognize human emotions. It has been evident from results that MLP gives best accuracy to recognize human emotion in response to audio music tracks using hybrid features of brain signals. It is also observed that rock and rap genres generated happy and sad emotions respectively in subjects under study. The brain signals of age group (26–35 years) gave best emotion recognition accuracy in accordance to the self reported emotions.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (354KB)Download full-size imageThe Experimental Study of ‘Unwanted Music’ Noise Pollution Influence on Command Recognition by Brain-Computer Interface - ScienceDirectNowadays, the alternative methods of human-computer interactions are in development. These methods can drastically improve usability of cyber-physical systems and devices, as mobile robots, especially for disabled people. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are among them. Unfortunately, BCIs aren’t reliable enough to handle critical devices outside lab environments since the quality of command recognition can be influenced by external conditions, as noise pollution that can distract the user of BCI. In this paper, we are presenting the experimental study results of the noise pollution influence in the form of unwanted music on the quality of control through BCI. In general, the obtained results showed the negative impact on the accuracy of control for the most of participants.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectMusic streaming systems that are useful and provide enjoyment lead to adoption.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectSystems that are useful and provide enjoyment reduce digital piracy.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of creativity facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of community facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectPreventing unauthorized downloading and other forms of digital piracy has been a persistent challenge. Strategies based on deterrence, ethical arguments, or technical measures have been effective, but only to a limited extent. The rising popularity of music streaming systems, however, affords the owners of digital content opportunities to experiment with alternative business models and value propositions that may also discourage digital piracy. The results of this field study involving 139 subjects suggest that music streaming systems that incorporate features that facilitate individual creativity and community building contributes towards the enjoyment and usefulness of the system. This in turn leads to music streaming adoption. The results of the study also show that the usefulness of a music streaming system is associated with a reduction in pirating intention. Surprisingly, a link between the enjoyment of a music streaming system and a reduction in digital pirating intention was not supported.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (137KB)Download full-size imageCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectAn e-learning collaborative environment for music composing was examined.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectWe used assessment thorough video analysis and a semi-structured interview.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe technological context reshaped thinking and collaborative strategies.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCollaboration, identity and meta-cognition were critical.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe participants demonstrated awareness of the potentialities of the online tools.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectUsing a sociocultural theory of creativity as a framework, the current study aims to analyze the communication modes employed by adult musicians during the collaborative online composition of a new music piece and to define how creativity was expressed and supported. The study task was an authentic activity for the participants, who interacted in a virtual environment using synchronous and asynchronous tools to develop a project. The study employed a qualitative case study approach that involved video observation of the participants’ interactions during the online activities and individual semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that collaborative creativity involved musical and social practices. Furthermore, collaboration, identity and meta- cognition were considered critical in supporting participation and interest. The mediational role of the technological context and how it reshaped thinking strategies and collaborative strategies were analyzed. The participants demonstrated awareness of the potentialities of the online tools and the achievement of consciousness about the performed task. The results are discussed in relation to the framework of the sociocultural research on collaborative creativity, and implications for education are considered.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectMusic and academic performance - ScienceDirectStudents who select music courses have better grades than the others in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCognitive mechanisms related to overcoming cognitive dissonances are discussed.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectEnjoyment of music might cause academic improvement.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectIn a previous study we demonstrated that listening to a pleasant music while performing an academic test helped students to overcome stress, to devote more time to more stressful and more complicated task and the grades were higher. Yet, there remained ambiguities as for the causes of the higher test performance of these students: do they perform better because they hear music during their examinations, or would they perform better anyway because they are more gifted/motivated? This motivated the current study as a preliminary step toward that general question: Do students who like/perform music have better grades than the others? Our results confirmed this hypothesis: students studying music have better grades in all subjects.Introducing experience-centred approaches in music teacher education—Opportunities for pedagogic metamorphosis - ScienceDirectIntroducing experience-centred approaches in music teacher education—Opportunities for pedagogic metamorphosis - ScienceDirectFocus redirected to the embodied dimensions of creative connection building.Introducing experience-centred approaches in music teacher education—Opportunities for pedagogic metamorphosis - ScienceDirectEmbodied actions and connections shown as catalysts of group cohesion, intersubjectivity, creative connectivity and pedagogical transformations.Introducing experience-centred approaches in music teacher education—Opportunities for pedagogic metamorphosis - ScienceDirectPoints toward the need to reconceptualise music education and music teacher training.Introducing experience-centred approaches in music teacher education—Opportunities for pedagogic metamorphosis - ScienceDirectEvidences the value of experience-centred pedagogies in facilitating creative, probing habits of mind.Introducing experience-centred approaches in music teacher education—Opportunities for pedagogic metamorphosis - ScienceDirectEducation experts emphasise the growing pedagogic urgency to cultivate exploratory, creative habits of mind. As contemporary scientific inquiry has revealed, a major obstacle in this process is the predominant view of creativity as powered by the intellect. We addressed this concern by looking at embodied forms of creative connectivity. Our study focused on the Kokas pedagogy: an experiential extension of the Kodaly principle of music education. We explored the adaptability and the transformative potentials of this pedagogy in the context of music teacher education. Based on the qualitative analysis of the first student cohorts’ reflective essays (13 altogether), we studied students’ sense making of the otherness of the pedagogy. In particular, we looked at the key tensions students documented, and investigated students’ reflective construction of their own responses to these. In doing so, we hoped to capture the choreography of students’ meaning making of their experiences. Furthermore, we looked at the transformational power of students’ immersion in the pedagogy: the extent to which it inspired them towards a fundamental change in perspectives, inciting a pedagogic metamorphosis. Our analysis revealed that the challenges reported by students were often overcome through participatory, creative experiences of being and becoming. Thus, the inherent features of the pedagogy offered the tools to respond to the transformational opportunities it presented. Going beyond the context of music education, our study shows the significance of experiential, embodied connectivity between teachers and students in paving the way towards the transformation of the personal, professional and institutional habits of mind.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectMelody similarity in music is a perception of listeners based on cognitive method. Thus, the algorithms should be based on perceptually oriented computational model. We have used computer generated synthesized tune of popular song and its variations to understand similarity notion. We have generated variations of a tune by changing musical scale or relative duration of notes or notes itself and combination of them. The proposed approach to calculate similarity relationship between two tunes will be useful to model the melody similarity notion for various applications such as QBH (Query by humming), music classification and retrieval, music plagiarism etc.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of International Conference on Advanced Computing Technologies and Applications (ICACTA-2015).Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectListening to 10 min of happy and sad music excerpts changed emotional states.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectListening to happy music affected functional cerebral asymmetries.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectLeft hemispheric functioning was particularly sensitive to music listening.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in laterality were not mediated by changes in mood.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectTempo manipulation of the musical excerpt did not modulate the laterality effect.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectAfter decades of research, it remains unclear whether emotion lateralization occurs because one hemisphere is dominant for processing the emotional content of the stimuli, or whether emotional stimuli activate lateralised networks associated with the subjective emotional experience. By using emotion-induction procedures, we investigated the effect of listening to happy and sad music on three well-established lateralization tasks. In a prestudy, Mozart’s piano sonata (K. 448) and Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata were rated as the most happy and sad excerpts, respectively. Participants listened to either one emotional excerpt, or sat in silence before completing an emotional chimeric faces task (Experiment 1), visual line bisection task (Experiment 2) and a dichotic listening task (Experiment 3 and 4). Listening to happy music resulted in a reduced right hemispheric bias in facial emotion recognition (Experiment 1) and visuospatial attention (Experiment 2) and increased left hemispheric bias in language lateralization (Experiments 3 and 4). Although Experiments 1–3 revealed an increased positive emotional state after listening to happy music, mediation analyses revealed that the effect on hemispheric asymmetries was not mediated by music-induced emotional changes. The direct effect of music listening on lateralization was investigated in Experiment 4 in which tempo of the happy excerpt was manipulated by controlling for other acoustic features. However, the results of Experiment 4 made it rather unlikely that tempo is the critical cue accounting for the effects. We conclude that listening to music can affect functional cerebral asymmetries in well-established emotional and cognitive laterality tasks, independent of music-induced changes in the emotion state.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectAdults with schizophrenia are less discriminative for harmonic changes in music, therefore, the perceptual and cognitive processing of understanding and responding to music may not be the same as that of healthy adults.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectSP group showed less sensitivity to the increased level of harmonic complexity within the music, suggesting that their evaluation of music complexity was not coherent.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectNo significant differences were found between groups in terms of their interest in and preference for harmonic progression in music.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe use of harmonic progression for adults with schizophrenia can be effectively considered in music selection.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectMusic therapists should incorporate an appropriate level of harmonic complexity in the music when used in mental health settings.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThis study compared how adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and those without schizophrenia perceived the harmonic progression of music. Thirty adults diagnosed with schizophrenia (SP) and 37 healthy adults without schizophrenia (NSP) listened to musical excerpts with five different harmonic progressions. After listening to each excerpt, the participants reported their perception of the complexity of the musical excerpt, their personal interest in the excerpt, and their personal preference for the musical excerpt on an 11-point scale. The results showed that the SP group tended to be less sensitive to increased harmonic complexity, and this difference reached statistical significance (p = 0.040). No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of their interest in or preference for harmonic progression in music. However, among harmonic progression, interest level (p = 0.014), and personal preference (p = 0.000), there were significant interaction effects. Overall, and in line with previous studies the findings indicate that adults with SP are less sensitive to harmonic progressions and harmonic changes in music. Findings from this study provide essential information for music selection when working with clients with schizophrenia in mental health settings.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe first two authors are co-first authors and contributed equally to this work.Mentalising music in frontotemporal dementia - ScienceDirectDespite considerable recent interest, the biological basis and clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) pose unresolved problems. Mentalising (the cognitive capacity to interpret the behaviour of oneself and others in terms of mental states) is impaired as a prominent feature of bvFTD, consistent with involvement of brain regions including ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes. Here, we investigated mentalising ability in a cohort of patients with bvFTD using a novel modality: music. We constructed a novel neuropsychological battery requiring attribution of affective mental or non-mental associations to musical stimuli. Mentalising performance of patients with bvFTD (n = 20) was assessed in relation to matched healthy control subjects (n = 20); patients also had a comprehensive assessment of behaviour and general neuropsychological functions. Neuroanatomical correlates of performance on the experimental tasks were investigated using voxel-based morphometry of patients' brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Compared to healthy control subjects, patients showed impaired ability to attribute mental states but not non-mental characteristics to music, and this deficit correlated with performance on a standard test of social inference and with carer ratings of patients' empathic capacity, but not with other potentially relevant measures of general neuropsychological function. Mentalising performance in the bvFTD group was associated with grey matter changes in anterior temporal lobe and ventro-medial PFC. These findings suggest that music can represent surrogate mental states and the ability to construct such mental representations is impaired in bvFTD, with potential implications for our understanding of the biology of bvFTD and human social cognition more broadly.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectTen untrained subjects listened to 3 culturally different styles of music stimuli.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were measured and global and local network properties compared.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectLight music and western classical music perception manifested small world properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectChinese and western classical music perception showed right lateralization.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectFurther research is needed to understand network properties of music perception.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectGraph theoretical analysis has recently become a popular research tool in neuroscience, however, there have been very few studies on brain responses to music perception, especially when culturally different styles of music are involved.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music. For event-related potentials, phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and then constructed into correlation matrices. Clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths were evaluated for global properties, while clustering coefficients and efficiency were assessed for local network properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectPerception of light music and western classical music manifested small-world network properties, especially with a relatively low proportion of weights of correlation matrices. For local analysis, efficiency was more discernible than clustering coefficient. Nevertheless, there was no significant discrimination between Chinese traditional and western classical music perception.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectPerception of different styles of music introduces different network properties, both globally and locally. Research into both global and local network properties has been carried out in other areas; however, this is a preliminary investigation aimed at suggesting a possible new approach to brain network properties in music perception.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectThis is a special focus paper published in connection with the 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology (iCBEB 2013), held in Wuhan, China, October 11-13, 2013.Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectMusic for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectMusic listening reduced mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and state anxiety.Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectLowering anxiety enabled successful performances for students in simulation testing.Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectResults support music as a viable intervention for improving outcomes for students.Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectPerformance anxiety related to nursing simulation can potentially impede student learning.Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectThis study employed a randomized control group pretest–posttest design to examine the effect of music listening on anxiety, self-efficacy, and performance among baccalaureate nursing students undergoing simulation testing (N = 38; Mage = 23.05, standard deviation = 3.41).Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectHeart rate, mean arterial pressure, and state-trait anxiety scores were significantly lower in the experimental group, F(3, 35) = 6.55, p = .02, η2 = 0.27, whereas instructor performance ratings were significantly higher than the control condition (p = .009). No differences were seen on self-efficacy scores (p = .37).Music for Anxiety Reduction and Performance Enhancement in Nursing Simulation - ScienceDirectThe intervention has the potential to reduce anxiety, improve performance, and facilitate learning in simulation testing experiences.Study on Brain Dynamics by Non Linear Analysis of Music Induced EEG Signals - ScienceDirectStudy on Brain Dynamics by Non Linear Analysis of Music Induced EEG Signals - ScienceDirectEEG data with music induced stimuli.Study on Brain Dynamics by Non Linear Analysis of Music Induced EEG Signals - ScienceDirectNon linear analysis of alpha, theta and gamma brain rhythms using DFA technique.Study on Brain Dynamics by Non Linear Analysis of Music Induced EEG Signals - ScienceDirectRetention of memory corresponding to alpha frequency range.Study on Brain Dynamics by Non Linear Analysis of Music Induced EEG Signals - ScienceDirectMusic has been proven to be a valuable tool for the understanding of human cognition, human emotion, and their underlying brain mechanisms. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of Hindustani music on brain activity during normal relaxing conditions using electroencephalography (EEG). Ten male healthy subjects without special musical education participated in the study. EEG signals were acquired at the frontal (F3/F4) lobes of the brain while listening to music at three experimental conditions (rest, with music and without music). Frequency analysis was done for the alpha, theta and gamma brain rhythms. The finding shows that arousal based activities were enhanced while listening to Hindustani music of contrasting emotions (romantic/sorrow) for all the subjects in case of alpha frequency bands while no significant changes were observed in gamma and theta frequency ranges. It has been observed that when the music stimulus is removed, arousal activities as evident from alpha brain rhythms remain for some time, showing residual arousal. This is analogous to the conventional ‘Hysteresis’ loop where the system retains some ‘memory’ of the former state. This is corroborated in the non linear analysis (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) of the alpha rhythms as manifested in values of fractal dimension. After an input of music conveying contrast emotions, withdrawal of music shows more retention as evidenced by the values of fractal dimension.“I got the business blues”: what organizations can learn from popular music? - ScienceDirectAs the link between sustainable development and art begins to shed a new light on organizational conceptions, this article considers popular music, and especially blues music. The conceptual process of the paper is to highlight the philosophical roots of Western aesthetics in order to propose a counterpoint based on popular and ordinary living sustained by popular music. By analyzing blues music as both a durable support and a natural process of everyday experience, we open a door to Chinese philosophy and psychology for HR Management based on the body-mind-spirit alignment. This perspective generates new and creative avenues for research in HR management, organizational theory, and business education. The major issue is then how to sensitize the ears of HRM so that it offers ‘vital nourishment’ in the workplace at a time when the cost of the depressive state of many an employee has become a proven risk.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectEnhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectOutcomes showed the importance of early diagnosis of developmental dyscalculia to provide a satisfactory rehabilitation.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectMusical Training has a differential effect of Numerical Cognition comparing children with typical development and developmental dyscalculia.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectPerformance in Number Production increased after the Musical Training.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectStudies suggest that musical training enhances spatial-temporal reasoning and leads to greater learning of mathematical concepts. The aim of this prospective study was to verify the efficacy of a Non-Instrumental Musical Training (NIMT) on the Numerical Cognition systems in children with low achievement in math. For this purpose, we examined, with a cluster analysis, whether children with low scores on Numerical Cognition would be grouped in the same cluster at pre and post-NIMT. Participants were primary school children divided into two groups according to their scores on an Arithmetic test. Results with a specialized battery of Numerical Cognition revealed improvements for Cluster 2 (children with low achievement in math) especially for number production capacity compared to normative data. Besides, the number of children with low scores in Numerical Cognition decreased at post-NIMT. These findings suggest that NIMT enhances Numerical Cognition and seems to be a useful tool for rehabilitation of children with low achievement in math.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectThis research analyses the benefits of Music in the improvement of emotional intelligence, behaviour and school performance through an experience with a 4° ESO (the Spanish equivalent to England's Year 11) student group. Due to the impossibility of developing the educational work successfully, it was decided to put in practice a new model of work, designed combining knowledge of musical pedagogy, music therapy and emotional intelligence. For its development, different diagnostic instruments have been used in order to, once the results were obtained, redesign the work methodology in music class, and check the improvements in the parameters previously mentioned.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of HUM-665 Research Group “Research and Evaluation in Intercultural Education”.Music and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well. However, studies in recent decades reported a lack of satisfaction in music perception with cochlear implants. This article reviews the literature on music ability of cochlear implant users by presenting a systematic outline of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant recipients with regard to their music perception as well as production. The review also evaluates the similarities and differences between electric hearing and acoustic hearing regarding music perception. We summarize the research results in terms of the individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and timbre). Finally, we briefly introduce the vocal singing of prelingually-deafened children with cochlear implants as evaluated by acoustic measures.Mozart or Pelé?

The effects of adolescents' participation in music and sports - ScienceDirectWe analyse the effects of playing music, or doing sports on education and health outcomes of adolescents. After identifying adolescents who play music, do sports, or both, in the German Socio-Economic Panel, we use matching procedures to estimate causal effects. We find that playing music instead of doing sports fosters educational outcomes by about 0.1 standard deviations. Effects are stronger for girls, and for children from more highly educated families. Doing sports improves perceived health more strongly than playing music. Engaging in both activities, music and sports, improves educational outcomes by about 0.2 standard deviations and reduces smoking by about 10 percentage points compared to engaging in just one activity. Adolescents who engage in music spend less time watching TV or playing computer games, but more reading books. The robustness of the results is examined with respect to the identifying assumptions, including non-affected outcomes, a formal sensitivity analysis, and instrumental variable estimation. These checks do not reveal any serious problems.Mozart or Pelé?

However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which ABIs produce learning outcomes of value to organizations. This theoretical paper addresses this concern by revisiting the philosophy of art and education in light of developments in neuroscience known as embodied cognition. Specifically, we examine the role played by simulations in behavioral change and the way in which ABIs can foster the creation of simulations. This leads to two propositions, a) representing a phenomenon through new simulations can create new possibilities for interacting with this phenomenon; and b) making art is a means by which managers can construct new simulations. The significance of these propositions is illustrated by re-interpreting three accounts of art-based interventions found in the literature. These propositions have important implications for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ABIs in management education. In particular, they emphasize the need to match art medium with desired outcomes, provide support for the view that ABIs are well suited to learning about complex managerial challenges, and question the effectiveness of verbal reflection as part of ABIs.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music has been tried in children with refractory encephalopathies.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMusic therapy decreased seizure recurrence in about 45% of children.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectAll responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in both adults and young patients. In this prospective, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of listening to a set of Mozart's compositions, according to the Tomatis method, on sleep quality and behavioral disorders, including auto-/hetero-aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity, in a group of children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectThe study group was composed of 11 outpatients (7 males and 4 females), between 1.5 years and 21 years of age (mean age: 11.9 years), all suffering from drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy (n = 11). All of them had a severe/profound intellectual disability associated with cerebral palsy. During the study period, each patient had to listen to a set of Mozart's compositions 2 h per day for fifteen days for a total of 30 h, which could be distributed over the day depending on the habits and compliance of each patient.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectThe music was filtered by a device preferably delivering higher sound frequencies (> 3000 Hz) according to the Tomatis principles. The antiepileptic drug therapy remained unchanged throughout the study period. During the 15-day music therapy, 2 out of 11 patients had a reduction of 50–75% in seizure recurrence, and 3 out of 12 patients had a reduction of 75–89%. Overall, 5 (45.4%) out of 11 patients had a ≥ 50% reduction in the total number of seizures, while the percentage decrease of the total seizure number (11/11) compared with baseline was − 51.5% during the 15-day music therapy and − 20.7% in the two weeks after the end of treatment. All responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectThis article focuses on the use of locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study (grades 4-6) in south-eastern Estonian schools. The objective of the research is to document the experiences of music teachers in using locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study in south-eastern Estonian schools. As the main research problem, the question was posed: how and to what extent do teachers use their locality-related traditions in music lessons at the second stage of study? The research questions developed to solve the problem aimed to find out how music teachers define the concept of locality-related tradition and whether and how they utilize locality-related tradition in music lessons.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectTo find an answer to the research question, a survey in questionnaire form was conducted among 55 music teachers. The results of the survey questions showed that teachers define the meaning of locality-related tradition in quite different ways and that they themselves consider their knowledge of locality-related tradition as average or better than average. The survey also found that the ideas of Zoltán Kodaly, which have been used in music instruction for decades in Estonia, have laid a foundation where locality-related tradition and its different forms (such as songs, customs and games characteristic to a particular locality) are quite widely in use in music lessons. Music teachers were also of the opinion that use of locality-related tradition influences the identity, thinking and development of social experience among schoolchildren.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Future Academy® Cognitive Trading.Music Spectrum: A Music Immersion Virtual Environment for Children with Autism - ScienceDirectThis article reports on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), virtual environments and music therapy, defining and prototyping a virtual environment for assisting children in ASD cope with social situation through music activities. Music Spectrum help the development of communication skills, imagination and social interaction of children with ASD, which is a complex set of social unrest, marked by impaired social interaction, communication and restricted or stereotyped patterns of behaviors and interests. As virtual environments simulate real situations, children can experience overcoming their difficulties in interaction and communication in a more quiet and controlled environment before they are exposed to similar social tasks. Our choice for music is based several parents’ testimony about their children preferences and ways they use to regulate and organize themselves.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectThis study looks into the visual perception of phrasing in a Tai Chi routine as affected by a change of music. The research aimed to investigate whether the quality of phrasing between music and movement is improved with a more congruent accompaniment. Sixty respondents, undergraduate music majors from two universities in Malaysia, were invited to participate in this study. They were asked to evaluate the phrasing between music and movement in videos of the same Tai Chi routine but with two different music accompaniments. It was found that there is a significant difference in the evaluation, and that the video with music composed to provide a better congruence in phrasing received a higher rating.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children performed better at auditory but not visual statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children also showed larger changes in online statistical learning ERPs.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in musical abilities are associated with capacity for statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe question whether musical training is associated with enhanced auditory and cognitive abilities in children is of considerable interest. In the present study, we compared children with music training versus those without music training across a range of auditory and cognitive measures, including the ability to detect implicitly statistical regularities in input (statistical learning).Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning of regularities embedded in auditory and visual stimuli was measured in musically trained and age-matched untrained children between the ages of 9–11 years. In addition to collecting behavioural measures, we recorded electrophysiological measures to obtain an online measure of segmentation during the statistical learning tasks.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children showed better performance on melody discrimination, rhythm discrimination, frequency discrimination, and auditory statistical learning. Furthermore, grand-averaged ERPs showed that triplet onset (initial stimulus) elicited larger responses in the musically trained children during both auditory and visual statistical learning tasks. In addition, children’s music skills were associated with performance on auditory and visual behavioural statistical learning tasks.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectOur data suggests that individual differences in musical skills are associated with children’s ability to detect regularities.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe ERP data suggest that musical training is associated with better encoding of both auditory and visual stimuli. Although causality must be explored in further research, these results may have implications for developing music-based remediation strategies for children with learning impairments.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is characterized by verbal memory delays and a love of music.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWe examine if novel (unfamiliar) music can enhance verbal memory in WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThose with formal music training showed improved verbal memory.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectFormal music training may enhance educational outcomes for those with WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual delay and an affinity for music. It has been previously shown that familiar music can enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS who have had music training. There is also evidence that unfamiliar, or novel, music may also improve cognitive recall. This study was designed to examine if a novel melody could also enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS, and to more fully characterize music training in this population. We presented spoken or sung sentences that described an animal and its group name to 44 individuals with WS, and then tested their immediate and delayed memory using both recall and multiple choice formats. Those with formal music training (average duration of training 4½ years) scored significantly higher on both the spoken and sung recall items, as well as on the spoken multiple choice items, than those with no music training. Music therapy, music enjoyment, age, and Verbal IQ did not impact performance on the memory tasks. These findings provide further evidence that formal music lessons may impact the neurological pathways associated with verbal memory in individuals with WS, consistent with findings in typically developing individuals.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectSupportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectCombining music and imagery (MI) with sandplay.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectEncouraging self-expression of child witnesses of domestic violence.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectImproving emotional and behavioral adaptability.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this pilot study was to examine the possibility of supportive music and imagery (MI) in addition to sandplay as a therapeutic treatment to improve emotional and behavioral adaptability for child witnesses of domestic violence. Participants were three elementary school students (two boys, one girl) who were living or had lived at a domestic violence shelter in Republic of Korea. This single subject design intervention study measured the children’s self-expression levels during six individual sessions through a partial-interval recording, conducting pre-post measurements of emotions and behaviors using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL). The combination of MI and sandplay was shown to have a positive effect on the improvement of children’s self-expression and emotions. Implications for researchers and clinicians are discussed.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectAutism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a lifelong communication disorder that limits the abilities of diagnosed individuals to relate socially and interpret emotional cues. Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentEmbodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectA combination of acoustic and neurophysiological features are used to attempt to predict music-induced emotion.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectSignificant prediction results are achieved.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThese results are significantly better when a combination of features is used than either feature alone.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectFeatures selected include alpha and beta band powers and mel-cepstral coefficients.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectIt is widely acknowledged that music can communicate and induce a wide range of emotions in the listener. However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThis regression fit suggests that over 20% of the variance of the participant’s music induced emotions can be predicted by their neural activity and the properties of the music. Given the large amount of noise, non-stationarity, and non-linearity in both EEG and music, this is an encouraging result. Additionally, the combination of measures of brain activity and acoustic features describing the music played to our participants allows us to predict music-induced emotions with significantly higher accuracies than either feature type alone (p<0.01).Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectHumans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectLe point de vue cognitiviste/constructiviste présenté dans cet article s'oppose aux conceptions traditionnelles de la musique (musique en tant que son, comportement ou communication). Avec cette approche on cherche à être en accord avec les changements de style au cours de l'histoire qui se sont produits dans le repertoire de notation de la musique de l'Ouest Deux niveaux de traitement cognitif sont proposés: les processus sur le plan des styles particuliers (c'est à dire liés à une certaine période, culture ou communauté et les processus génériques universaux ou inter-styles. Douze de ces processus sont décrits. On examine certains problèmes posés par les approaches heuristiques fondées sur des définitions antérieures de la musique. En particulier, on examine les artéfacts des analyses théoriques (gammes, accords et hauteurs discrètes) et leur influence sur la recherche en psychologie musicale.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectI would like to thank William Kessen for many enlightening discussions on this topic and for comments on several drafts.

Research questions were: (a) What themes emerged from patients as they listened to music that was associated with music therapy sessions that were held during their treatment for breast cancer? (b) What unforeseen information was presented in the listening logs? The following themes were found through the analysis: Relaxation, Memories, Emotions, Spirituality, Beauty, Strength, Energy/Fatigue, Pain Relief, Family, and Physical Problems/Illness. These are discussed with examples from the logs. Implications for understanding patients’ experience of cancer and suggestions for using music therapy are included.Listening to music as part of treatment for breast cancer: A qualitative content analysis of patients’ listening logs - ScienceDirectThis project was funded by Susan G.

The research sample involves 372 Slovenian student and current general education teachers who, working in pairs, prepared 186 lesson plans for music education. The research results showed that the majority of the musical objectives planned in this study, pertained to the psychomotor domain, followed by the cognitive objectives and by the least represented objectives of the affective domain.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched. Eligible studies were published between 1990 and 2016, were published in English, included participants aged 65 or older living in residential facilities or being cared for in specialist dementia units, assessed music activity at group level and included at least one reported psychological dementia symptom measure (e.g., anxiety, depression, agitation) in older adults with dementia. Two authors reviewed all eligible studies.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectSix eligible studies were identified. The study designs included randomised controlled trials (n = 4), a randomised trial with cross-over design (n = 1) and a non-randomised controlled trial (n = 1). Sample sizes ranged between 20 and 104 participants and the majority of the participants were women. A wide variety of functional scores were used. Of the six eligible studies, three found that group music therapy reduced depression and agitation in persons with dementia, with improvements in depression occurring immediately after music therapy and throughout the course of therapy. Three other articles found that music therapy did not affect the behavioural assessment or had no additional beneficial short-term effect on reducing agitation.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThere is insufficient evidence of the effect of music therapy on anxiety, depression and agitation in this population. Future studies should consider how specific musical interventions can improve anxiety, depression and agitation in older adults with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectNeural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectPersonalized music selections were used to evoke nostalgia during fMRI scans.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in brain response to nostalgia were investigated.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectBrain response to nostalgia was predicted by trait sadness and nostalgia proneness.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectStimulus-specific information (tonality tracking/TT) was used to analyze fMRI data.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectInsula, IFG, midbrain, and cerebellum showed stronger TT during nostalgia.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectNostalgia is an emotion that is most commonly associated with personally and socially relevant memories. It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectCan music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectIn a virtual art gallery, music fosters e-behavioral intentions.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectImmersion and esthetic experience fully mediate this effect.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectMusic enables website visitors to live a more enjoyable and stimulating experience.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectImmersion and experience must be conceptualized and measured as two separate concepts.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectMusic is an appealing tool for designers who want to create an experiential website.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectWebsites must involve visitors in enjoyable and memorable experiences to entice people to revisit and recommend them. This article investigates the impact of music and seeks to explain e-behavioral intentions through two underlying processes: immersion and experience. A total of 250 persons were surveyed for their intentions to re-visit and recommend a virtual art gallery. The results reveal that music fosters e-behavioral intentions. They also emphasize that immersion and aesthetic experience (emotions and contemplation) mediate this effect.

Both systems rely, among others, on the human cognitive ability for rhythm (Kotz & Schwartze, 2010; Patel, 2003, 2006), intended as patterning over time (McAuley, 2010). It is however unclear: (i) when and how humans evolved rhythmic abilities, (ii) whether these were direct results of pressures for language or music, or simply by-products of other evolutionary processes (Patel, 2010), and (iii) the degree of overlap between rhythm in language and music cognition (Cason & Schön, 2012). At the same time, rhythm and synchronization are truly cross-disciplinary concepts, broadly employed not only in musicology and linguistics, but also in cognitive psychology, biology, and physics (Cummins, 2012; Greenfield & Roizen, 1993; Patel & Daniele, 2003; Pikovsky, Rosenblum, & Kurths, 2003; Strogatz & Stewart, 1993; Winfree, 1986). This often creates conflicts between definitions and assumptions from different disciplines (Cummins, 2012). In this talk, I present my ongoing work, trying to unveil the evolutionary bases of time patterning, and to build a unifying, theoretical framework for rhythm, transcending specific disciplines. I argue how a broad comparative approach, comparing different animal species (including humans), can inform us on the evolutionary origins of the cognitive ability to process rhythm (Fitch, 2012; Honing et al., 2012; Ravignani et al., 2013). I describe three parallel and complementary lines of research to understand the origins of rhythm. First, I introduce a theoretical framework providing a common platform for the interdisciplinary study of rhythm in music and language (Ravignani, Bowling, & Kirby, in press). The framework I propose, the “hierarchy of coupled oscillations”, attempts to connect human music, dance and phonology on one side, to occurrences of synchronization and chorusing in non-human animals (as in fireflies or crickets) on the other side (Hagen & Bryant, 2003; Hagen & Hammerstein, 2009). Second, I present some preliminary results on group synchronization in an agent-based model of chorusing, aimed at investigating rhythmic abilities in pre-musical hominids (Merker, Madison, & Eckerdal, 2009). In particular, I suggest how rhythmic complexity can emerge from simple, local interactions. This bottom-up approach is particularly useful in finding out which rhythmic features can in principle exist without centralized processing (Ravignani, 2014). In parallel, using a top-down approach, I describe some experimental pilot work investigating the cognitive abilities for rhythm in our closest living relatives: the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees naturally “drum” in the wild (Arcadi, Robert, & Boesch, 1998). Building on this natural predisposition, I describe the development and pilot testing of a new tool to sonify apes’ movements (Ravignani et al., 2013). Ongoing experiments with this “Prima-Drum” will serve to: (i) investigate the temporal nature of drumming patterns in chimpanzees, (ii) compare them to those found in music and language, and (iii) ascertain chimpanzees’ abilities in discriminating and copying human-produced rhythms (as described in phonology and music theory research).The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music. Similarly, RPE was higher in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition, but music had no effect. On the other hand, listening to music decreased the associative thoughts regardless of fatigue status. Heart rate was not influenced by any treatment.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectThese results suggest that listening to music changes attentional focus but is not able to reverse fatigue-derived alteration of performance.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectInteractive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectIn this study we examine the didactic potential of an interactive music system.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectA quasi-experimental control groups design was used to test the effect on audiation skills.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectNo statistically significant differences between the control and intervention group.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectImportant insights on transformative impact of technology integration.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectCan interactive technologies be useful for music education? This question was empirically investigated during a nine-month longitudinal study in which twelve children (1st and 2nd grade) learnt to play the clarinet. Six children (the intervention group) received instruction with the Music Paint Machine, an interactive music system that allows a musician to make a digital “painting” by playing music while making various movements on a coloured pressure mat. The other six children (control group) received the instruction without the use of technology.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectThe overall goal of the longitudinal study was (1) to integrate the Music Paint Machine in instrumental music instruction in order to develop good practices and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of instruction with the system on the learning process. To measure the effectiveness of instruction with the system, children were administered the Primary and Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (Gordon, 1986) as pre- and post-test. In addition, pre-tests were organised to map possible confounding variables, such as personality, home musical environment, motor skills and self-regulation skills. Although no statistically significant differences were found between the control and intervention group the study revealed important aspects about the transformative impact of technology in education. Furthermore, dealing with the complexity of a real-life educational setting and with the requirements of the quasi-experimental design, this study has provided insights on methodology (design, measures, analysis) in music educational technology research that can contribute to the further development of this branch of educational research.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues are frequently used to support movement learning and rehabilitation, but the neural basis of this behavioural effect is not yet clear. We investigated the microstructural neuroplasticity effects of adding musical cues to a motor learning task. We hypothesised that music-cued, left-handed motor training would increase fractional anisotropy (FA) in the contralateral arcuate fasciculus, a fibre tract connecting auditory, pre-motor and motor regions. Thirty right-handed participants were assigned to a motor learning condition either with (Music Group) or without (Control Group) musical cues. Participants completed 20 minutes of training three times per week over four weeks. Diffusion tensor MRI and probabilistic neighbourhood tractography identified FA, axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity before and after training. Results revealed that FA increased significantly in the right arcuate fasciculus of the Music group only, as hypothesised, with trends for AD to increase and RD to decrease, a pattern of results consistent with activity-dependent increases in myelination. No significant changes were found in the left ipsilateral arcuate fasciculus of either group. This is the first evidence that adding musical cues to movement learning can induce rapid microstructural change in white matter pathways in adults, with potential implications for therapeutic clinical practice.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectIn recent times, digital music items on the internet have been evolving in a vast information space where consumers try to find/locate the piece of music of their choice by means of search engines. The current trend of searching for music by means of music consumersʼ keywords/tags is unable to provide satisfactory search results. It is argued that search and retrieval of music can be significantly improved provided end-usersʼ tags are associated with semantic information in terms of acoustic metadata – the latter being easy to extract automatically from digital music items. This paper presents a lightweight ontology that will enable music producers to annotate music against MPEG-7 description (with its acoustic metadata) and the generated annotation may in turn be used to deliver meaningful search results. Several potential multimedia ontologies have been explored and a music annotation ontology, named mpeg-7Music, has been designed so that it can be used as a backbone for annotating music items.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirect► Currently internet searching for digital music items produces unsatisfactory results. ► Semantic annotation can significantly enhance search and retrieval of music items. ► We propose Mpeg-7Music ontology for semantic annotation of digital music items. ► Mpeg-7Music was mapped to MPEG-7 Audio data types and encoded in OWL1.0. ► Mpeg-7Music novelty: Creation of a bridge between music consumersʼ tags and Mpeg7.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectWe used speech-to-song illusions to assess pitch perception in music and language.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectIllusions allowed us to hold acoustic characteristics constant for speech and song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectListeners were better at detecting musically unexpected pitch changes than expected.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectThis pattern was only evident when stimuli were perceived to transform to song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectPitch processing is influenced by domain-specific knowledge, not just acoustics.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFew studies comparing music and language processing have adequately controlled for low-level acoustical differences, making it unclear whether differences in music and language processing arise from domain-specific knowledge, acoustic characteristics, or both. We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectFree listening of music evokes ERPs similar to simplified stimuli.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectRapid changes in musical features of polyphonic music evoke N100 and P200 response.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectThe N100 and P200 responses are detected across different musical genres.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectBrain responses to discrete short sounds have been studied intensively using the event-related potential (ERP) method, in which the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is divided into epochs time-locked to stimuli of interest. Here we introduce and apply a novel technique which enables one to isolate ERPs in human elicited by continuous music. The ERPs were recorded during listening to a Tango Nuevo piece, a deep techno track and an acoustic lullaby. Acoustic features related to timbre, harmony, and dynamics of the audio signal were computationally extracted from the musical pieces. Negative deflation occurring around 100 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (N100) and positive deflation occurring around 200 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (P200) ERP responses to peak changes in the acoustic features were distinguishable and were often largest for Tango Nuevo. In addition to large changes in these musical features, long phases of low values that precede a rapid increase – and that we will call Preceding Low-Feature Phases – followed by a rapid increase enhanced the amplitudes of N100 and P200 responses. These ERP responses resembled those to simpler sounds, making it possible to utilize the tradition of ERP research with naturalistic paradigms.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe study provides a detailed analysis of the music experiences of clients in treatment for alcohol and drug problems.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectClients of a hospital alcohol and drug service said that music listening intensified their emotional response to drug taking and vice versa.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectForty-three percent of the clients in residential rehabilitation identified a specific song or genre of music that cued an urge to use substances.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMechanisms linking music with cravings included associations with their previous substance use; music evoked emotions associated with previous substance use; and music contained lyrics concerning their primary substance.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectA majority of clients endorsed a view that music was important in their recovery from substance misuse.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMusic is commonly associated with substance use yet little is known about the music experiences of adults with substance use disorders. In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery. The findings are considered in terms of their clinical implications.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectLife-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectMusic practice is known to have a positive impact on the cognition of older adults.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectWe examined the brain correlates of lifelong music practice in older musicians.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectMusicians and non-musicians underwent a go/nogo task while ERPs were recorded.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectWe found group differences in behavioral accuracy as well as N2 and P3 amplitudes.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectTherefore, music practice may increase resistance to cognitive aging.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectRecent research has indicated that music practice can influence cognitive processing across the lifespan. Although extensive musical experience may have a mitigating effect on cognitive decline in older adults, the nature of changes to brain functions underlying performance benefits remains underexplored. The present study was designed to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms that may support apparent beneficial effects of life-long musical practice on cognition. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in older musicians (N=17; average age=69.2) and non-musicians (N=17; average age=69.9), matched for age and education, while they completed an executive control task (visual go/no-go). Whereas both groups showed similar response speed and accuracy on go trials, older musicians showed fewer no-go errors. ERP recordings revealed the typical N2/P3 complex, but the nature of these responses differed between groups in that (1) older musicians showed larger N2 and P3 effects (‘no-go minus go’ amplitude), with the N2 amplitude being correlated with behavioral accuracy for no-go trials and (2) the topography of the P3 response was more anterior in musicians. Moreover, P3 amplitude was correlated with measures of musical experience in musicians. In our discussion of these results, we propose that music practice may have conferred an executive control advantage for musicians in later life.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectCreating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectWe present a particle system to create real-time animations choreographed by music.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectA proof-of-concept implementation shows that is possible to observe visual patterns.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectThe visual patterns match the theme of the musical composition.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectUser studies also show a perceptual relation between music terms and visual patterns.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectUsage examples are visual appreciation, entertainment and composition support tool.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we present a simplified 3D particle system and fast translation algorithm we have designed and implemented to generate real-time animated particle emitter fountains choreographed by a classical music.

Adolescents (N = 548, M age = 15.32, 52% female) completed a number of questionnaires on musical preferences, general media use, aggression, sexual outcomes, and prosocial behavior at two different time points separated by about one year. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the data, results revealed that listening to aggression in music was associated with increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior over time, even when controlling for initial levels of these behaviors. Listening to sexual content in music was associated with earlier initiation of sexual intercourse and a trend for a higher number of sexual partners (reported at Time 2). Prosocial behavior in music was not associated with any behavioral outcome longitudinally. Collectively, these results suggest that listening to certain types of content in music can have a longitudinal effect on behavior during adolescence.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectExisting work using dry land exercise-related activities has shown that the careful application of music can lead to a range of benefits that include enhanced affect, lower perceived exertion, greater energy efficiency, and faster time trial performances. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of asynchronous music in swimming using a mixed-methods approach.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectA mixed-model design was employed wherein there was a within-subjects factor (two experimental conditions and a control) and a between-subjects factor (gender). The experimental component of the study was supplemented by qualitative data that were analysed using inductive content analysis.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectTwenty six participants (Mage = 20.0 years, age range: 18–23 years) underwent a period of habituation with Speedo Aquabeat MP3 players prior to the experimental phase. They were then administered two experimental trials (motivational and oudeterous music at 130 bpm) and a no-music control, during which they engaged in a 200-m freestyle swimming time trial.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectParticipants swam significantly faster when exposed to either music condition relative to control (p = .022, ηp2=.18). Moreover, the music conditions were associated with higher state motivation (p = .016, ηp2=.15) and more dissociative thoughts (p = .014, ηp2=.16).Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectFindings supported the hypothesis that the use of asynchronous music during a high-intensity task can have an ergogenic effect; this was in the order of 2% when averaged out across the two experimental conditions. The use of music, regardless of its motivational qualities, resulted in higher self-reported motivation as well as more dissociative thoughts.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirect► We assess the effects of asynchronous music in a swimming time trial. ► We had two contrasting music conditions and a no-music control. ► Participants swam significantly faster when exposed to either music condition. ► Both music conditions led to significantly higher state motivation. ► Use of asynchronous music had an ergogenic effect in the order of 2%.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectFitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectWith learning, perceptual systems become strategically tuned to an organism’s needs.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectPeople “hack” their own perceptual systems to make them more useful to cognition.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectCognition as interactions between goals, perceptual training and altered modules.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectPerceptual modules adapt at evolutionary, lifelong, and moment-to-moment temporal scales to better serve the informational needs of cognizers. Perceptual learning is a powerful way for an individual to become tuned to frequently recurring patterns in its specific local environment that are pertinent to its goals without requiring costly executive control resources to be deployed. Mechanisms like predictive coding, categorical perception, and action-informed vision allow our perceptual systems to interface well with cognition by generating perceptual outputs that are systematically guided by how they will be used. In classic conceptions of perceptual modules, people have access to the modules’ outputs but no ability to adjust their internal workings. However, humans routinely and strategically alter their perceptual systems via training regimes that have predictable and specific outcomes. In fact, employing a combination of strategic and automatic devices for adapting perception is one of the most promising approaches to improving cognition.The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectThis study has been carried out in order to evaluate the music perception and creativity of preschoolers by using two different means of ICTs. Children were tested on computer based music activities with a most efficient method for a common educational goal. An interactive music environment was used for children aged four to six years old (N = 28) in order to stimulate their inherent musical skills through interaction with the computer and other additional audiovisual mediums. Specifically, there were two cases:The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectCase I: Use of computer mouse by the preschoolers.The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectCase II: Use of automatic movement recognition technology.The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectThe second case appeared to be more effective in preschoolers as they provided better results in concentration and interest. Such results have further implications concerning the use of alternative technological equipment in preschool music education.Neural correlates of music recognition in Down syndrome - ScienceDirectThe brain mechanisms that subserve music recognition remain unclear despite increasing interest in this process. Here we report the results of a magnetoencephalography experiment to determine the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of brain regions activated during listening to a familiar and unfamiliar instrumental melody in control adults and adults with Down syndrome (DS). In the control group, listening to the familiar melody relative to the unfamiliar melody, revealed early and significant activations in the left primary auditory cortex, followed by activity in the limbic and sensory-motor regions and finally, activation in the motor related areas. In the DS group, listening to the familiar melody relative to the unfamiliar melody revealed increased significant activations in only three regions. Activity began in the left primary auditory cortex and the superior temporal gyrus and was followed by enhanced activity in the right precentral gyrus. These data suggest that familiar music is associated with auditory–motor coupling but does not activate brain areas involved in emotional processing in DS. These findings reveal new insights on the neural basis of music perception in DS as well as the temporal course of neural activity in control adults.Neural correlates of music recognition in Down syndrome - ScienceDirect► Brain mechanisms involved in familiar/unfamiliar music recognition in Down syndrome (DS) is unknown. ► Music recognition may involve two overlapping networks related to auditory, motor and social-emotion processing. ► In DS, music recognition may only involve auditory–motor coupling.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectModel-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectA Model-Based Testing (MBT) applied to a Realtime Interactive Music Systems (IMS).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectA formal description of an Intermediate Representation (IR) to model the IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectAutomatic model construction from a timed scenario (mixed score).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectTranslation from IR into a Network of Timed Automata to use existing tools (Uppaal).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectImplementation of two approaches (offline and online) applied to case studies.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThe role of an Interactive Music System (IMS) is to accompany musicians during live performances, acting like a real musician. It must react in realtime to audio signals from musicians, according to a timed high-level requirement called mixed score, written in a domain specific language. Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThis work has been partly supported by a DGA-MRIS scholarship and the project Inedit (ANR-12-CORD-009).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectDGA Direction Generale de l'Armement (French national defense).Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectAs people age with HIV, cognitive problems may become more prevalent and severe, but lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity) have been shown to protect brain health and cognition. We examined the perceptions that older adults living with HIV have about protecting and improving brain health and cognition through lifestyle behaviors. Qualitative data were analyzed from four focus groups (N = 30) of African Americans and Caucasians living with HIV and at least 50 years of age. An open-coding scheme using conventional content analysis was employed. Two results were found. First, many older adults with HIV in our study expressed a variety of cognitive complaints that interfered with daily function. Second, these participants reported few specific ideas about how such health behaviors were important to their own brain health and cognition. Education interventions may help older adults with HIV learn to improve and protect brain health and cognition as they age.Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectDavid E.

Interview and observation results revealed that the subject had typical autistic communication impairments before the music education sessions. A single-case-single-site qualitative action research design was used to inquire into the verbal and non-verbal interactions, singing as well as the reading skills of the subject. Research findings through observations, video recording and interview with the class teacher revealed that the subject had obvious improvement in his verbal and non-verbal interactions as well as his reading and singing skills after intervention. Finally, recommendations for conducting music interventions were given.Communication Responses of an Indian Student with Autism to Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of JIBES University, Jakarta.Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectPerceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectMusic reading is a complex behavior involving both hemispheres in different ways.Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectFunctional asymmetries depend mainly from motor output (single- or two hands playing).Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectMusic reading in pianists is per se asymmetrical due to left hand bass-clef notation.Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectForty-six right-handed pianists were tested in a music sight-reading task in which they had to perform on a keyboard. Stimuli were single notes or single triads (chords) presented tachistoscopically in the left or right visual field in form of musical notation or verbal labels. Left-hand, right-hand or two-hands performance was required. Results showed, besides the expected Simon effect producing faster responses for stimuli to be performed with the hand ipsilateral to the side of presentation, a complex pattern of laterality which depended primarily upon the requested motor output. A tendency in favor of the left hemisphere (right visual field, RVF) was observed, this asymmetry being significant only in the single-hand tasks. On the contrary, in the two-hands task an opposite asymmetry was observed with musical notation. Moreover, a strong unexpected role of the bass clef was observed, which penalized left hand performance in particular with LVF stimuli. This effect even overcame the Simon effect, suggesting the presence of a bias in favor of the left hemisphere in musical transposition. Results point to a variegated pattern of hemispheric asymmetries in music sight-reading which depend on both stimulus coding and motor output type (e.g. two- or single-hand performance). A RH asymmetry was observed during two-hands playing with musical notation. Conversely, playing with one hand seems more leftward lateralized. This pattern of asymmetry would reflect a LH ability in simple “core” music reading together with a RH ability in the coordination of simultaneous responses by the two hands.Theoretical foundations and workable assumptions for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry - ScienceDirectThis article offers a theoretical foundation for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry. First, two cases are presented to give an insight into music therapy in forensic psychiatry. Secondly some background information on forensic psychiatry is provided. The Risk-Need-Responsivity model is explained as a starting point and the role of music therapy in this treatment is explained. The third part offers a cognitive behavioral music therapy model and explains the (neurological) role of music and the music therapist in the treatment of forensic psychiatric problems. The article ends with a few final remarks.Theoretical foundations and workable assumptions for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry - ScienceDirect► Theoretical foundations and workable assumptions for cognitive-behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry. ► Neurological function of music in onset of behavioral changes of forensic psychiatric patients. ► Music therapy suits Risk-Need-Responsivity and Good Lives models of forensic psychiatry. ► Directing music therapy to a cognitive-behavioral treatment model.Theoretical foundations and workable assumptions for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry - ScienceDirectThe authors are thankful for the research funds provided by ArtEZ, Institute of the Arts and Forensic Psychiatric Center Oostvaarderskliniek.

Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectApplying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectTo date, there is no music therapy literature specific to bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectSocial learning theory can be applied to understand behaviors of bullies and victims.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectSocial learning theory and the Orff-Schulwerk philosophy can be applied to designing engaging music therapy interventions for bullies and victims.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectResearchers have found music therapy to be effective with populations that share characteristics of bullies and victims.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectBullying is a growing worldwide problem largely affecting school-aged youth and, to date, there is no music therapy literature specific to bullying. As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectIn this letter, we present different approaches for music genre classification. The proposed techniques, which are composed of a feature extraction stage followed by a classification procedure, explore both the variations of parameters used as input and the classifier architecture. Tests were carried out with three styles of music, namely blues, classical, and lounge, which are considered informally by some musicians as being “big dividers” among music genres, showing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and establishing a relationship between the relevance of each set of parameters for each music style and each classifier. In contrast to other works, entropies and fractal dimensions are the features adopted for the classifications.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectRethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectMusicality persists in dementia as documented in empirical and popular sources.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectDominant approaches to understanding this phenomenon emphasize cognition.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectEmbodiment as a potential source of agency has been neglected in discourse on music.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectA relational model of citizenship offers a critical perspective on musicality.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectThis underscores the ethical imperative to more fully support musicality in dementia.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectWith the biomedicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of dementia, music programs, as with other arts- and leisure-based programs, have primarily been implemented as non-pharmacological means to generate social and behavioural changes. We argue that understanding and fully supporting the musicality of persons living with dementia requires engagement with citizenship discourse. Specifically we draw on a model of relational citizenship that recognizes that corporeality is a fundamental source of self-expression, interdependence, and reciprocal engagement. We articulate this argument with reference to the musicality of two residents living with dementia in long-term residential care; one example is drawn from an ethnographic study of selfhood in dementia and the other is from a study of elder-clowning. Relational citizenship brings a new and critical dimension to the discourse on music, ageing, and the body in contemporary society. It further highlights the ethical imperative to fully support musicality through institutional policies, structures and practices.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectThis research analyses the benefits of Music in the improvement of emotional intelligence, behaviour and school performance through an experience with a 4° ESO (the Spanish equivalent to England's Year 11) student group. Due to the impossibility of developing the educational work successfully, it was decided to put in practice a new model of work, designed combining knowledge of musical pedagogy, music therapy and emotional intelligence. For its development, different diagnostic instruments have been used in order to, once the results were obtained, redesign the work methodology in music class, and check the improvements in the parameters previously mentioned.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of HUM-665 Research Group “Research and Evaluation in Intercultural Education”.Music and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well. However, studies in recent decades reported a lack of satisfaction in music perception with cochlear implants. This article reviews the literature on music ability of cochlear implant users by presenting a systematic outline of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant recipients with regard to their music perception as well as production. The review also evaluates the similarities and differences between electric hearing and acoustic hearing regarding music perception. We summarize the research results in terms of the individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and timbre). Finally, we briefly introduce the vocal singing of prelingually-deafened children with cochlear implants as evaluated by acoustic measures.Mozart or Pelé?

The effects of adolescents' participation in music and sports - ScienceDirectWe analyse the effects of playing music, or doing sports on education and health outcomes of adolescents. After identifying adolescents who play music, do sports, or both, in the German Socio-Economic Panel, we use matching procedures to estimate causal effects. We find that playing music instead of doing sports fosters educational outcomes by about 0.1 standard deviations. Effects are stronger for girls, and for children from more highly educated families. Doing sports improves perceived health more strongly than playing music. Engaging in both activities, music and sports, improves educational outcomes by about 0.2 standard deviations and reduces smoking by about 10 percentage points compared to engaging in just one activity. Adolescents who engage in music spend less time watching TV or playing computer games, but more reading books. The robustness of the results is examined with respect to the identifying assumptions, including non-affected outcomes, a formal sensitivity analysis, and instrumental variable estimation. These checks do not reveal any serious problems.Mozart or Pelé?

However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which ABIs produce learning outcomes of value to organizations. This theoretical paper addresses this concern by revisiting the philosophy of art and education in light of developments in neuroscience known as embodied cognition. Specifically, we examine the role played by simulations in behavioral change and the way in which ABIs can foster the creation of simulations. This leads to two propositions, a) representing a phenomenon through new simulations can create new possibilities for interacting with this phenomenon; and b) making art is a means by which managers can construct new simulations. The significance of these propositions is illustrated by re-interpreting three accounts of art-based interventions found in the literature. These propositions have important implications for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ABIs in management education. In particular, they emphasize the need to match art medium with desired outcomes, provide support for the view that ABIs are well suited to learning about complex managerial challenges, and question the effectiveness of verbal reflection as part of ABIs.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music has been tried in children with refractory encephalopathies.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMusic therapy decreased seizure recurrence in about 45% of children.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectAll responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in both adults and young patients. In this prospective, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of listening to a set of Mozart's compositions, according to the Tomatis method, on sleep quality and behavioral disorders, including auto-/hetero-aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity, in a group of children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectThe study group was composed of 11 outpatients (7 males and 4 females), between 1.5 years and 21 years of age (mean age: 11.9 years), all suffering from drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy (n = 11). All of them had a severe/profound intellectual disability associated with cerebral palsy. During the study period, each patient had to listen to a set of Mozart's compositions 2 h per day for fifteen days for a total of 30 h, which could be distributed over the day depending on the habits and compliance of each patient.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectThe music was filtered by a device preferably delivering higher sound frequencies (> 3000 Hz) according to the Tomatis principles. The antiepileptic drug therapy remained unchanged throughout the study period. During the 15-day music therapy, 2 out of 11 patients had a reduction of 50–75% in seizure recurrence, and 3 out of 12 patients had a reduction of 75–89%. Overall, 5 (45.4%) out of 11 patients had a ≥ 50% reduction in the total number of seizures, while the percentage decrease of the total seizure number (11/11) compared with baseline was − 51.5% during the 15-day music therapy and − 20.7% in the two weeks after the end of treatment. All responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectThis article focuses on the use of locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study (grades 4-6) in south-eastern Estonian schools. The objective of the research is to document the experiences of music teachers in using locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study in south-eastern Estonian schools. As the main research problem, the question was posed: how and to what extent do teachers use their locality-related traditions in music lessons at the second stage of study? The research questions developed to solve the problem aimed to find out how music teachers define the concept of locality-related tradition and whether and how they utilize locality-related tradition in music lessons.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectTo find an answer to the research question, a survey in questionnaire form was conducted among 55 music teachers. The results of the survey questions showed that teachers define the meaning of locality-related tradition in quite different ways and that they themselves consider their knowledge of locality-related tradition as average or better than average. The survey also found that the ideas of Zoltán Kodaly, which have been used in music instruction for decades in Estonia, have laid a foundation where locality-related tradition and its different forms (such as songs, customs and games characteristic to a particular locality) are quite widely in use in music lessons. Music teachers were also of the opinion that use of locality-related tradition influences the identity, thinking and development of social experience among schoolchildren.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Future Academy® Cognitive Trading.Music Spectrum: A Music Immersion Virtual Environment for Children with Autism - ScienceDirectThis article reports on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), virtual environments and music therapy, defining and prototyping a virtual environment for assisting children in ASD cope with social situation through music activities. Music Spectrum help the development of communication skills, imagination and social interaction of children with ASD, which is a complex set of social unrest, marked by impaired social interaction, communication and restricted or stereotyped patterns of behaviors and interests. As virtual environments simulate real situations, children can experience overcoming their difficulties in interaction and communication in a more quiet and controlled environment before they are exposed to similar social tasks. Our choice for music is based several parents’ testimony about their children preferences and ways they use to regulate and organize themselves.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectThis study looks into the visual perception of phrasing in a Tai Chi routine as affected by a change of music. The research aimed to investigate whether the quality of phrasing between music and movement is improved with a more congruent accompaniment. Sixty respondents, undergraduate music majors from two universities in Malaysia, were invited to participate in this study. They were asked to evaluate the phrasing between music and movement in videos of the same Tai Chi routine but with two different music accompaniments. It was found that there is a significant difference in the evaluation, and that the video with music composed to provide a better congruence in phrasing received a higher rating.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children performed better at auditory but not visual statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children also showed larger changes in online statistical learning ERPs.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in musical abilities are associated with capacity for statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe question whether musical training is associated with enhanced auditory and cognitive abilities in children is of considerable interest. In the present study, we compared children with music training versus those without music training across a range of auditory and cognitive measures, including the ability to detect implicitly statistical regularities in input (statistical learning).Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning of regularities embedded in auditory and visual stimuli was measured in musically trained and age-matched untrained children between the ages of 9–11 years. In addition to collecting behavioural measures, we recorded electrophysiological measures to obtain an online measure of segmentation during the statistical learning tasks.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children showed better performance on melody discrimination, rhythm discrimination, frequency discrimination, and auditory statistical learning. Furthermore, grand-averaged ERPs showed that triplet onset (initial stimulus) elicited larger responses in the musically trained children during both auditory and visual statistical learning tasks. In addition, children’s music skills were associated with performance on auditory and visual behavioural statistical learning tasks.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectOur data suggests that individual differences in musical skills are associated with children’s ability to detect regularities.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe ERP data suggest that musical training is associated with better encoding of both auditory and visual stimuli. Although causality must be explored in further research, these results may have implications for developing music-based remediation strategies for children with learning impairments.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is characterized by verbal memory delays and a love of music.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWe examine if novel (unfamiliar) music can enhance verbal memory in WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThose with formal music training showed improved verbal memory.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectFormal music training may enhance educational outcomes for those with WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual delay and an affinity for music. It has been previously shown that familiar music can enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS who have had music training. There is also evidence that unfamiliar, or novel, music may also improve cognitive recall. This study was designed to examine if a novel melody could also enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS, and to more fully characterize music training in this population. We presented spoken or sung sentences that described an animal and its group name to 44 individuals with WS, and then tested their immediate and delayed memory using both recall and multiple choice formats. Those with formal music training (average duration of training 4½ years) scored significantly higher on both the spoken and sung recall items, as well as on the spoken multiple choice items, than those with no music training. Music therapy, music enjoyment, age, and Verbal IQ did not impact performance on the memory tasks. These findings provide further evidence that formal music lessons may impact the neurological pathways associated with verbal memory in individuals with WS, consistent with findings in typically developing individuals.Music, music therapy and dementia: A review of literature and the recommendations of the Italian Psychogeriatric Association - ScienceDirectThis study reviews the most recent (from 2000 to 2011) Clinical Controlled Trials (CCT) and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) concerning the use of music and music-therapy (MT) in the context of dementia and related issues.Music, music therapy and dementia: A review of literature and the recommendations of the Italian Psychogeriatric Association - ScienceDirectStudies which explored the efficacy of music and MT on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are prevalent, while those aiming at assessing a potential effect of these approaches on cognitive and physiological aspects are scant. Although with some limitations, the results of these studies are consistent with the efficacy of MT approach on BPSD. In this context, the ability of the music therapist to directly interact with the patients appears to be crucial for the success of the intervention.Music, music therapy and dementia: A review of literature and the recommendations of the Italian Psychogeriatric Association - ScienceDirectThis review was endorsed by the Italian Psychogeriatric Association (AIP) and represents its view about the criteria to select appropriate music and MT approaches in the field of dementia. Accordingly, we have developed a list of recommendations to facilitate the current use of these techniques in the context of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with dementia.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectSupportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectCombining music and imagery (MI) with sandplay.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectEncouraging self-expression of child witnesses of domestic violence.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectImproving emotional and behavioral adaptability.Supportive music and imagery with sandplay for child witnesses of domestic violence: A pilot study report - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this pilot study was to examine the possibility of supportive music and imagery (MI) in addition to sandplay as a therapeutic treatment to improve emotional and behavioral adaptability for child witnesses of domestic violence. Participants were three elementary school students (two boys, one girl) who were living or had lived at a domestic violence shelter in Republic of Korea. This single subject design intervention study measured the children’s self-expression levels during six individual sessions through a partial-interval recording, conducting pre-post measurements of emotions and behaviors using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL). The combination of MI and sandplay was shown to have a positive effect on the improvement of children’s self-expression and emotions. Implications for researchers and clinicians are discussed.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectAutism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a lifelong communication disorder that limits the abilities of diagnosed individuals to relate socially and interpret emotional cues. Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentMusic misuse: A review of the personal and collective roles of “problem music” - ScienceDirectMusic misuse: A review of the personal and collective roles of “problem music” - ScienceDirectPositive and negative influences of musical preferences are reviewed.Music misuse: A review of the personal and collective roles of “problem music” - ScienceDirectSystematic search provides seven genres which should be termed as Problem Music.Music misuse: A review of the personal and collective roles of “problem music” - ScienceDirectThese genres are associated with negative/criminal behavior, tendency and attitude.Music misuse: A review of the personal and collective roles of “problem music” - ScienceDirectTheoretical explanations for the psychological and sociological functions are given.Music misuse: A review of the personal and collective roles of “problem music” - ScienceDirectLiterature on musical preferences and their influence on behavior and ideation has primarily focused on specific musical preferences and linked certain music genres with psychological vulnerability and social deviance. The aim of this review was to: (a) gather information about musical preferences and their influence on behavior and thoughts in order to determine both positive and negative influences of each music genre on listeners; (b) present the main literature about genres that have negative influence on listeners; and (c) provide theoretical explanations for the psychological and sociological functions of those genres. A systematic review of the literature identified the following genres as having negative influence on listeners: alternative rock, hard rock, heavy metal, hip-hop/rap, punk rock, rock and trance/house/electronic/techno. Research showed that those genres were associated with substance and alcohol abuse, opposing authority and rebelliousness, impulsive and antisocial traits, violent behavior, and delinquency. Of the few studies that investigated positive aspects of the above genres, some focused on the role of those genres in regulating negative feelings and constructing personal and social identity, while other studies stressed the importance of those genres in constructing group and cultural identity and educating listeners.Embodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.A systematic review on the effects of active participation in rhythm-centred music making on different aspects of health - ScienceDirectRhythm-centred music making (RMM) especially drumming and percussion music has been shown to be effective in promoting personal and interpersonal well-being. It is widely used both as a treatment as well as an adjunctive therapy for various conditions. Hence, we aimed to provide a systematic review of the current literature on the effects of active participation of RMM with a focus on drumming and percussion on an individual. This will inform the undertaking of future focused research in this area.A systematic review on the effects of active participation in rhythm-centred music making on different aspects of health - ScienceDirectWe carried out a literature search using PubMed® and PsychInfo® with relevant keywords and employed the PRISMA® criteria. We included English peer-reviewed articles that studied the effects of drumming or percussion music which were assessed by 2 independent reviewers. The type and year of study, study design, sample size, sample characteristics, intervention as well as outcomes are presented. The effects of RMM were categorised according to physical, psychological and social health.A systematic review on the effects of active participation in rhythm-centred music making on different aspects of health - ScienceDirectA total of 4198 articles were identified and reviewed and 18 articles were found to be relevant. 15, 4 and 6 articles were shown to provide evidence of RMM for positive impact on physical, psychological and social health respectively. 5 and 4 studies were conducted in the geriatrics and the pediatrics setting respectively with the remainder using psychiatric and general settings.A systematic review on the effects of active participation in rhythm-centred music making on different aspects of health - ScienceDirectIn this systematic review on the effect of active participation in RMM positive effects were seen across social, physical and psychological health domains. We hope that this systematic review will facilitate future focused research in areas that have yet to be explored.Music Biology: All This Useful Beauty - ScienceDirectSome healthy people fail to derive pleasure from music despite otherwise preserved perceptual and reward responses. Such ‘musical anhedonia’ implies the existence of music-specific brain reward mechanisms, which could provide a substrate for music to acquire biological value.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectA combination of acoustic and neurophysiological features are used to attempt to predict music-induced emotion.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectSignificant prediction results are achieved.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThese results are significantly better when a combination of features is used than either feature alone.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectFeatures selected include alpha and beta band powers and mel-cepstral coefficients.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectIt is widely acknowledged that music can communicate and induce a wide range of emotions in the listener. However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThis regression fit suggests that over 20% of the variance of the participant’s music induced emotions can be predicted by their neural activity and the properties of the music. Given the large amount of noise, non-stationarity, and non-linearity in both EEG and music, this is an encouraging result. Additionally, the combination of measures of brain activity and acoustic features describing the music played to our participants allows us to predict music-induced emotions with significantly higher accuracies than either feature type alone (p<0.01).Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectHumans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectLe point de vue cognitiviste/constructiviste présenté dans cet article s'oppose aux conceptions traditionnelles de la musique (musique en tant que son, comportement ou communication). Avec cette approche on cherche à être en accord avec les changements de style au cours de l'histoire qui se sont produits dans le repertoire de notation de la musique de l'Ouest Deux niveaux de traitement cognitif sont proposés: les processus sur le plan des styles particuliers (c'est à dire liés à une certaine période, culture ou communauté et les processus génériques universaux ou inter-styles. Douze de ces processus sont décrits. On examine certains problèmes posés par les approaches heuristiques fondées sur des définitions antérieures de la musique. En particulier, on examine les artéfacts des analyses théoriques (gammes, accords et hauteurs discrètes) et leur influence sur la recherche en psychologie musicale.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectI would like to thank William Kessen for many enlightening discussions on this topic and for comments on several drafts. I also owe thanks to Irvin Child and Robert Crowder, each of whom gave a critical reading to an early form of the manuscript.

Research questions were: (a) What themes emerged from patients as they listened to music that was associated with music therapy sessions that were held during their treatment for breast cancer? (b) What unforeseen information was presented in the listening logs? The following themes were found through the analysis: Relaxation, Memories, Emotions, Spirituality, Beauty, Strength, Energy/Fatigue, Pain Relief, Family, and Physical Problems/Illness. These are discussed with examples from the logs. Implications for understanding patients’ experience of cancer and suggestions for using music therapy are included.Listening to music as part of treatment for breast cancer: A qualitative content analysis of patients’ listening logs - ScienceDirectThis project was funded by Susan G.

The research sample involves 372 Slovenian student and current general education teachers who, working in pairs, prepared 186 lesson plans for music education. The research results showed that the majority of the musical objectives planned in this study, pertained to the psychomotor domain, followed by the cognitive objectives and by the least represented objectives of the affective domain.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.The development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectIn the field of psychology, the first studies in experimental aesthetics were conducted approximately 140 years ago. Since then, research has mainly concentrated on aesthetic responses to visual art. Both the aesthetic experience of music and, especially, its development have received rather limited attention. Moreover, until now, very little attention has been paid to the investigation of the aesthetic experience of music using neuroscientific methods. Aesthetic experiences are multidimensional and include inter alia sensory, perceptual, affective, and cognitive components. Aesthetic processes are usually experienced as pleasing and rewarding and are, thus, important and valuable experiences for many people. Because of their multidimensional nature, these processes employ several brain areas. In the present review, we examine important psychological and neural mechanisms that are believed to contribute to the development of aesthetic experiences of music. We also discuss relevant research findings. With the present review, we wish to provoke further discussion and possible future investigations as we consider the investigation of aesthetic experiences to be important both scientifically and with respect to potential clinical applications.The development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirect► ‘Core’ liking for basic sound properties (e.g., consonance) occurs already in infancy. ► Musical rhythm is processed in motor areas that are related to the mirror neuron system. ► Sad and happy emotions in music can be recognized by young children. ► Music cognition and music emotions require higher order brain mechanisms. ► Children rely on beauty for music aesthetic judgments; neural substrates still to be determined.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched. Eligible studies were published between 1990 and 2016, were published in English, included participants aged 65 or older living in residential facilities or being cared for in specialist dementia units, assessed music activity at group level and included at least one reported psychological dementia symptom measure (e.g., anxiety, depression, agitation) in older adults with dementia. Two authors reviewed all eligible studies.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectSix eligible studies were identified. The study designs included randomised controlled trials (n = 4), a randomised trial with cross-over design (n = 1) and a non-randomised controlled trial (n = 1). Sample sizes ranged between 20 and 104 participants and the majority of the participants were women. A wide variety of functional scores were used. Of the six eligible studies, three found that group music therapy reduced depression and agitation in persons with dementia, with improvements in depression occurring immediately after music therapy and throughout the course of therapy. Three other articles found that music therapy did not affect the behavioural assessment or had no additional beneficial short-term effect on reducing agitation.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThere is insufficient evidence of the effect of music therapy on anxiety, depression and agitation in this population. Future studies should consider how specific musical interventions can improve anxiety, depression and agitation in older adults with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectNeural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectPersonalized music selections were used to evoke nostalgia during fMRI scans.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in brain response to nostalgia were investigated.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectBrain response to nostalgia was predicted by trait sadness and nostalgia proneness.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectStimulus-specific information (tonality tracking/TT) was used to analyze fMRI data.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectInsula, IFG, midbrain, and cerebellum showed stronger TT during nostalgia.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectNostalgia is an emotion that is most commonly associated with personally and socially relevant memories. It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectCan music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectIn a virtual art gallery, music fosters e-behavioral intentions.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectImmersion and esthetic experience fully mediate this effect.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectMusic enables website visitors to live a more enjoyable and stimulating experience.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectImmersion and experience must be conceptualized and measured as two separate concepts.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectMusic is an appealing tool for designers who want to create an experiential website.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectWebsites must involve visitors in enjoyable and memorable experiences to entice people to revisit and recommend them. This article investigates the impact of music and seeks to explain e-behavioral intentions through two underlying processes: immersion and experience. A total of 250 persons were surveyed for their intentions to re-visit and recommend a virtual art gallery. The results reveal that music fosters e-behavioral intentions. They also emphasize that immersion and aesthetic experience (emotions and contemplation) mediate this effect. The findings, confirming the impact of music on immersion, could thus help managers design more effective Websites.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectTel: +33 4 76 70 65 75; fax: +33 4 76 70 60 88.Can music improve e-behavioral intentions by enhancing consumers’ immersion and experience? - ScienceDirectTel: +33 4 76 63 53 69; fax: +33 4 76 82 59 99.The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectMusic and language are two of the most prominent human features. Both systems rely, among others, on the human cognitive ability for rhythm (Kotz & Schwartze, 2010; Patel, 2003, 2006), intended as patterning over time (McAuley, 2010). It is however unclear: (i) when and how humans evolved rhythmic abilities, (ii) whether these were direct results of pressures for language or music, or simply by-products of other evolutionary processes (Patel, 2010), and (iii) the degree of overlap between rhythm in language and music cognition (Cason & Schön, 2012). At the same time, rhythm and synchronization are truly cross-disciplinary concepts, broadly employed not only in musicology and linguistics, but also in cognitive psychology, biology, and physics (Cummins, 2012; Greenfield & Roizen, 1993; Patel & Daniele, 2003; Pikovsky, Rosenblum, & Kurths, 2003; Strogatz & Stewart, 1993; Winfree, 1986). This often creates conflicts between definitions and assumptions from different disciplines (Cummins, 2012). In this talk, I present my ongoing work, trying to unveil the evolutionary bases of time patterning, and to build a unifying, theoretical framework for rhythm, transcending specific disciplines. I argue how a broad comparative approach, comparing different animal species (including humans), can inform us on the evolutionary origins of the cognitive ability to process rhythm (Fitch, 2012; Honing et al., 2012; Ravignani et al., 2013). I describe three parallel and complementary lines of research to understand the origins of rhythm. First, I introduce a theoretical framework providing a common platform for the interdisciplinary study of rhythm in music and language (Ravignani, Bowling, & Kirby, in press). The framework I propose, the “hierarchy of coupled oscillations”, attempts to connect human music, dance and phonology on one side, to occurrences of synchronization and chorusing in non-human animals (as in fireflies or crickets) on the other side (Hagen & Bryant, 2003; Hagen & Hammerstein, 2009). Second, I present some preliminary results on group synchronization in an agent-based model of chorusing, aimed at investigating rhythmic abilities in pre-musical hominids (Merker, Madison, & Eckerdal, 2009). In particular, I suggest how rhythmic complexity can emerge from simple, local interactions. This bottom-up approach is particularly useful in finding out which rhythmic features can in principle exist without centralized processing (Ravignani, 2014). In parallel, using a top-down approach, I describe some experimental pilot work investigating the cognitive abilities for rhythm in our closest living relatives: the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees naturally “drum” in the wild (Arcadi, Robert, & Boesch, 1998). Building on this natural predisposition, I describe the development and pilot testing of a new tool to sonify apes’ movements (Ravignani et al., 2013). Ongoing experiments with this “Prima-Drum” will serve to: (i) investigate the temporal nature of drumming patterns in chimpanzees, (ii) compare them to those found in music and language, and (iii) ascertain chimpanzees’ abilities in discriminating and copying human-produced rhythms (as described in phonology and music theory research).The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music. Similarly, RPE was higher in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition, but music had no effect. On the other hand, listening to music decreased the associative thoughts regardless of fatigue status. Heart rate was not influenced by any treatment.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectThese results suggest that listening to music changes attentional focus but is not able to reverse fatigue-derived alteration of performance.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectInteractive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectIn this study we examine the didactic potential of an interactive music system.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectA quasi-experimental control groups design was used to test the effect on audiation skills.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectNo statistically significant differences between the control and intervention group.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectImportant insights on transformative impact of technology integration.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectCan interactive technologies be useful for music education? This question was empirically investigated during a nine-month longitudinal study in which twelve children (1st and 2nd grade) learnt to play the clarinet. Six children (the intervention group) received instruction with the Music Paint Machine, an interactive music system that allows a musician to make a digital “painting” by playing music while making various movements on a coloured pressure mat. The other six children (control group) received the instruction without the use of technology.Interactive technologies in the instrumental music classroom: A longitudinal study with the Music Paint Machine - ScienceDirectThe overall goal of the longitudinal study was (1) to integrate the Music Paint Machine in instrumental music instruction in order to develop good practices and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of instruction with the system on the learning process. To measure the effectiveness of instruction with the system, children were administered the Primary and Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (Gordon, 1986) as pre- and post-test. In addition, pre-tests were organised to map possible confounding variables, such as personality, home musical environment, motor skills and self-regulation skills. Although no statistically significant differences were found between the control and intervention group the study revealed important aspects about the transformative impact of technology in education. Furthermore, dealing with the complexity of a real-life educational setting and with the requirements of the quasi-experimental design, this study has provided insights on methodology (design, measures, analysis) in music educational technology research that can contribute to the further development of this branch of educational research.The impact of music on metabolism - ScienceDirectThe study of music and medicine is a rapidly growing field that in the past, has been largely focused on the use of music as a complementary therapy. Increasing interest has been centered on understanding the physiologic mechanisms underlying the effects of music and, more recently, the suggested role of music in modulating metabolic responses. Research has established a role for music in the regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, the sympathetic nervous system, and the immune system, which have key functions in the regulation of metabolism and energy balance. More recent findings have shown a role for music in the metabolic recovery from stress, the regulation of gastric and intestinal motility, the moderation of cancer-related gastrointestinal symptoms, and the increase of lipid metabolism and lactic acid clearance during exercise and postexercise recovery. The purpose of this article is to summarize the most current understanding of the mechanisms by which music affects the metabolic responses in the context of potential applications.The impact of music on metabolism - ScienceDirectMs. Yamasaki and Ms. Booker contributed equally to this work.Hearing and music in dementia - ScienceDirectMusic is a complex acoustic signal that relies on a number of different brain and cognitive processes to create the sensation of hearing. Changes in hearing function are generally not a major focus of concern for persons with a majority of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). However, changes in the processing of sounds may be an early, and possibly preclinical, feature of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this chapter is to review the current state of knowledge concerning hearing and music perception in persons who have a dementia as a result of a neurodegenerative disease. The review focuses on both peripheral and central auditory processing in common neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on the processing of music and other non-verbal sounds. The chapter also reviews music interventions used for persons with neurodegenerative diseases.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues are frequently used to support movement learning and rehabilitation, but the neural basis of this behavioural effect is not yet clear. We investigated the microstructural neuroplasticity effects of adding musical cues to a motor learning task. We hypothesised that music-cued, left-handed motor training would increase fractional anisotropy (FA) in the contralateral arcuate fasciculus, a fibre tract connecting auditory, pre-motor and motor regions. Thirty right-handed participants were assigned to a motor learning condition either with (Music Group) or without (Control Group) musical cues. Participants completed 20 minutes of training three times per week over four weeks. Diffusion tensor MRI and probabilistic neighbourhood tractography identified FA, axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity before and after training. Results revealed that FA increased significantly in the right arcuate fasciculus of the Music group only, as hypothesised, with trends for AD to increase and RD to decrease, a pattern of results consistent with activity-dependent increases in myelination. No significant changes were found in the left ipsilateral arcuate fasciculus of either group. This is the first evidence that adding musical cues to movement learning can induce rapid microstructural change in white matter pathways in adults, with potential implications for therapeutic clinical practice.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectIn recent times, digital music items on the internet have been evolving in a vast information space where consumers try to find/locate the piece of music of their choice by means of search engines. The current trend of searching for music by means of music consumersʼ keywords/tags is unable to provide satisfactory search results. It is argued that search and retrieval of music can be significantly improved provided end-usersʼ tags are associated with semantic information in terms of acoustic metadata – the latter being easy to extract automatically from digital music items. This paper presents a lightweight ontology that will enable music producers to annotate music against MPEG-7 description (with its acoustic metadata) and the generated annotation may in turn be used to deliver meaningful search results. Several potential multimedia ontologies have been explored and a music annotation ontology, named mpeg-7Music, has been designed so that it can be used as a backbone for annotating music items.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirect► Currently internet searching for digital music items produces unsatisfactory results. ► Semantic annotation can significantly enhance search and retrieval of music items. ► We propose Mpeg-7Music ontology for semantic annotation of digital music items. ► Mpeg-7Music was mapped to MPEG-7 Audio data types and encoded in OWL1.0. ► Mpeg-7Music novelty: Creation of a bridge between music consumersʼ tags and Mpeg7.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectWe used speech-to-song illusions to assess pitch perception in music and language.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectIllusions allowed us to hold acoustic characteristics constant for speech and song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectListeners were better at detecting musically unexpected pitch changes than expected.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectThis pattern was only evident when stimuli were perceived to transform to song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectPitch processing is influenced by domain-specific knowledge, not just acoustics.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFew studies comparing music and language processing have adequately controlled for low-level acoustical differences, making it unclear whether differences in music and language processing arise from domain-specific knowledge, acoustic characteristics, or both. We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Treatment and prevention of music performance anxiety - ScienceDirectMusic performance anxiety (MPA) regularly occurs when musicians present themselves before an audience in performance situations, and thus, it plays an important role in the careers of professional musicians. MPA is expressed on the emotional and physical level, as well as on the levels of thinking and behavior, and extends along a continuum of varying severity. Its performance-impairing, afflicting form is considered to be a specific type of social phobia, which requires therapy. There are different psychological theories, which contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon of MPA and provide basic principles for the various treatment approaches. Current “best practice,” in our clinical experience, is a personal- and problem-oriented approach within a multimodal therapy model, including the range of psychoanalytic and cognitive behavioral therapies, body-oriented methods, and mental techniques.Treatment and prevention of music performance anxiety - ScienceDirectIn order to avoid severe MPA, prevention in the field of music pedagogic is very important. Thus, the concepts of dealing positively with MPA should be implemented very early into the instrumental and vocal education of musicians.Benefits of music therapy on behaviour disorders in subjects diagnosed with dementia: A systematic review - ScienceDirectDementia is characterised by cognitive deterioration and the manifestation of psychological and behavioural symptoms, especially changes in perception, thought content, mood, and conduct. In addition to drug therapy, non-pharmacological treatments are used to manage these symptoms, and one of these latter treatments is music therapy. Since this novel technique in non-verbal, it can be used to treat patients with dementia at any stage, even when cognitive deterioration is very severe. Patients’ responses to music are conserved even in the most advanced stages of the disease.Benefits of music therapy on behaviour disorders in subjects diagnosed with dementia: A systematic review - ScienceDirectA literature research was carried out using the following databases: Academic Search Complete, PubMed, Science Direct y Dialnet.

Here we introduce and apply a novel technique which enables one to isolate ERPs in human elicited by continuous music. The ERPs were recorded during listening to a Tango Nuevo piece, a deep techno track and an acoustic lullaby. Acoustic features related to timbre, harmony, and dynamics of the audio signal were computationally extracted from the musical pieces. Negative deflation occurring around 100 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (N100) and positive deflation occurring around 200 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (P200) ERP responses to peak changes in the acoustic features were distinguishable and were often largest for Tango Nuevo. In addition to large changes in these musical features, long phases of low values that precede a rapid increase – and that we will call Preceding Low-Feature Phases – followed by a rapid increase enhanced the amplitudes of N100 and P200 responses. These ERP responses resembled those to simpler sounds, making it possible to utilize the tradition of ERP research with naturalistic paradigms.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe study provides a detailed analysis of the music experiences of clients in treatment for alcohol and drug problems.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectClients of a hospital alcohol and drug service said that music listening intensified their emotional response to drug taking and vice versa.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectForty-three percent of the clients in residential rehabilitation identified a specific song or genre of music that cued an urge to use substances.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMechanisms linking music with cravings included associations with their previous substance use; music evoked emotions associated with previous substance use; and music contained lyrics concerning their primary substance.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectA majority of clients endorsed a view that music was important in their recovery from substance misuse.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMusic is commonly associated with substance use yet little is known about the music experiences of adults with substance use disorders. In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery. The findings are considered in terms of their clinical implications.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectLife-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectMusic practice is known to have a positive impact on the cognition of older adults.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectWe examined the brain correlates of lifelong music practice in older musicians.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectMusicians and non-musicians underwent a go/nogo task while ERPs were recorded.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectWe found group differences in behavioral accuracy as well as N2 and P3 amplitudes.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectTherefore, music practice may increase resistance to cognitive aging.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectRecent research has indicated that music practice can influence cognitive processing across the lifespan. Although extensive musical experience may have a mitigating effect on cognitive decline in older adults, the nature of changes to brain functions underlying performance benefits remains underexplored. The present study was designed to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms that may support apparent beneficial effects of life-long musical practice on cognition. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in older musicians (N=17; average age=69.2) and non-musicians (N=17; average age=69.9), matched for age and education, while they completed an executive control task (visual go/no-go). Whereas both groups showed similar response speed and accuracy on go trials, older musicians showed fewer no-go errors. ERP recordings revealed the typical N2/P3 complex, but the nature of these responses differed between groups in that (1) older musicians showed larger N2 and P3 effects (‘no-go minus go’ amplitude), with the N2 amplitude being correlated with behavioral accuracy for no-go trials and (2) the topography of the P3 response was more anterior in musicians. Moreover, P3 amplitude was correlated with measures of musical experience in musicians. In our discussion of these results, we propose that music practice may have conferred an executive control advantage for musicians in later life.Franz Joseph Gall and music: the faculty and the bump - ScienceDirectThe traditional story maintains that Franz Joseph Gall's (1758–1828) scientific program began with his observations of schoolmates with bulging eyes and good verbal memories. But his search to understand human nature, in particular individual differences in capacities, passions, and tendencies, can also be traced to other important observations, one being of a young girl with an exceptional talent for music. Rejecting contemporary notions of cognition, Gall concluded that behavior results from the interaction of a limited set of basic faculties, each with its own processes for perception and memory, each with its own territory in both cerebral or cerebellar cortices. Gall identified 27 faculties, one being the sense of tone relations or music. The description of the latter is identical in both his Anatomie et Physiologie and Sur les Fonctions du Cerveau et sur Celles de Chacune de ses Parties, where he provided positive and negative evidences and discussed findings from humans and lower animals, for the faculty. The localization of the cortical faculty for talented musicians, he explained, is demonstrated by a “bump” on each side of the skull just above the angle of the eye; hence, the lower forehead of musicians is broader or squarer than in other individuals. Additionally, differences between singing and nonsinging birds also correlate with cranial features. Gall even brought age, racial, and national differences into the picture. What he wrote about music reveals much about his science and creative thinking.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectCreating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectWe present a particle system to create real-time animations choreographed by music.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectA proof-of-concept implementation shows that is possible to observe visual patterns.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectThe visual patterns match the theme of the musical composition.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectUser studies also show a perceptual relation between music terms and visual patterns.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectUsage examples are visual appreciation, entertainment and composition support tool.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we present a simplified 3D particle system and fast translation algorithm we have designed and implemented to generate real-time animated particle emitter fountains choreographed by a classical music. The approach we used to translate and map the controlling information into the musical fountain animation is also introduced, as well as the process to build the physical model of the music fountains. A proof of concept is implemented to demonstrate the main system's aspects, its feasibility, and that it has met the system's design goals. Moreover, it shows that is possible to observe visual patterns that match the theme of the musical composition, as an example of how the system can be used not only for visual appreciation and entertainment, but also as a possible support tool for music composition. We have also conducted a user study as an evaluation of the system. The results of this have provided us with positive and useful feedback on the effectiveness of our visual mappings as well as further directions to explore.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Shi Kho Chang.Sex, violence, & rock n' roll: Longitudinal effects of music on aggression, sex, and prosocial behavior during adolescence - ScienceDirectThe current study examined longitudinal associations between listening to aggression, sex, and prosocial behavior in music on a number of behavioral outcomes across a one-year period during adolescence. Adolescents (N = 548, M age = 15.32, 52% female) completed a number of questionnaires on musical preferences, general media use, aggression, sexual outcomes, and prosocial behavior at two different time points separated by about one year. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the data, results revealed that listening to aggression in music was associated with increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior over time, even when controlling for initial levels of these behaviors. Listening to sexual content in music was associated with earlier initiation of sexual intercourse and a trend for a higher number of sexual partners (reported at Time 2). Prosocial behavior in music was not associated with any behavioral outcome longitudinally. Collectively, these results suggest that listening to certain types of content in music can have a longitudinal effect on behavior during adolescence.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectExisting work using dry land exercise-related activities has shown that the careful application of music can lead to a range of benefits that include enhanced affect, lower perceived exertion, greater energy efficiency, and faster time trial performances. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of asynchronous music in swimming using a mixed-methods approach.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectA mixed-model design was employed wherein there was a within-subjects factor (two experimental conditions and a control) and a between-subjects factor (gender). The experimental component of the study was supplemented by qualitative data that were analysed using inductive content analysis.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectTwenty six participants (Mage = 20.0 years, age range: 18–23 years) underwent a period of habituation with Speedo Aquabeat MP3 players prior to the experimental phase. They were then administered two experimental trials (motivational and oudeterous music at 130 bpm) and a no-music control, during which they engaged in a 200-m freestyle swimming time trial.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectParticipants swam significantly faster when exposed to either music condition relative to control (p = .022, ηp2=.18). Moreover, the music conditions were associated with higher state motivation (p = .016, ηp2=.15) and more dissociative thoughts (p = .014, ηp2=.16).Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirectFindings supported the hypothesis that the use of asynchronous music during a high-intensity task can have an ergogenic effect; this was in the order of 2% when averaged out across the two experimental conditions. The use of music, regardless of its motivational qualities, resulted in higher self-reported motivation as well as more dissociative thoughts.Psychological, psychophysical, and ergogenic effects of music in swimming - ScienceDirect► We assess the effects of asynchronous music in a swimming time trial. ► We had two contrasting music conditions and a no-music control. ► Participants swam significantly faster when exposed to either music condition. ► Both music conditions led to significantly higher state motivation. ► Use of asynchronous music had an ergogenic effect in the order of 2%.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectFitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectWith learning, perceptual systems become strategically tuned to an organism’s needs.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectPeople “hack” their own perceptual systems to make them more useful to cognition.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectCognition as interactions between goals, perceptual training and altered modules.Fitting perception in and to cognition - ScienceDirectPerceptual modules adapt at evolutionary, lifelong, and moment-to-moment temporal scales to better serve the informational needs of cognizers. Perceptual learning is a powerful way for an individual to become tuned to frequently recurring patterns in its specific local environment that are pertinent to its goals without requiring costly executive control resources to be deployed. Mechanisms like predictive coding, categorical perception, and action-informed vision allow our perceptual systems to interface well with cognition by generating perceptual outputs that are systematically guided by how they will be used. In classic conceptions of perceptual modules, people have access to the modules’ outputs but no ability to adjust their internal workings. However, humans routinely and strategically alter their perceptual systems via training regimes that have predictable and specific outcomes. In fact, employing a combination of strategic and automatic devices for adapting perception is one of the most promising approaches to improving cognition.The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectThis study has been carried out in order to evaluate the music perception and creativity of preschoolers by using two different means of ICTs. Children were tested on computer based music activities with a most efficient method for a common educational goal. An interactive music environment was used for children aged four to six years old (N = 28) in order to stimulate their inherent musical skills through interaction with the computer and other additional audiovisual mediums. Specifically, there were two cases:The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectCase I: Use of computer mouse by the preschoolers.The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectCase II: Use of automatic movement recognition technology.The use of ICT in preschool music education - ScienceDirectThe second case appeared to be more effective in preschoolers as they provided better results in concentration and interest. Such results have further implications concerning the use of alternative technological equipment in preschool music education.Neural correlates of music recognition in Down syndrome - ScienceDirectThe brain mechanisms that subserve music recognition remain unclear despite increasing interest in this process. Here we report the results of a magnetoencephalography experiment to determine the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of brain regions activated during listening to a familiar and unfamiliar instrumental melody in control adults and adults with Down syndrome (DS). In the control group, listening to the familiar melody relative to the unfamiliar melody, revealed early and significant activations in the left primary auditory cortex, followed by activity in the limbic and sensory-motor regions and finally, activation in the motor related areas. In the DS group, listening to the familiar melody relative to the unfamiliar melody revealed increased significant activations in only three regions. Activity began in the left primary auditory cortex and the superior temporal gyrus and was followed by enhanced activity in the right precentral gyrus. These data suggest that familiar music is associated with auditory–motor coupling but does not activate brain areas involved in emotional processing in DS. These findings reveal new insights on the neural basis of music perception in DS as well as the temporal course of neural activity in control adults.Neural correlates of music recognition in Down syndrome - ScienceDirect► Brain mechanisms involved in familiar/unfamiliar music recognition in Down syndrome (DS) is unknown. ► Music recognition may involve two overlapping networks related to auditory, motor and social-emotion processing. ► In DS, music recognition may only involve auditory–motor coupling.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectModel-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectA Model-Based Testing (MBT) applied to a Realtime Interactive Music Systems (IMS).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectA formal description of an Intermediate Representation (IR) to model the IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectAutomatic model construction from a timed scenario (mixed score).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectTranslation from IR into a Network of Timed Automata to use existing tools (Uppaal).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectImplementation of two approaches (offline and online) applied to case studies.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThe role of an Interactive Music System (IMS) is to accompany musicians during live performances, acting like a real musician. It must react in realtime to audio signals from musicians, according to a timed high-level requirement called mixed score, written in a domain specific language. Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThis work has been partly supported by a DGA-MRIS scholarship and the project Inedit (ANR-12-CORD-009).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectDGA Direction Generale de l'Armement (French national defense).Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectAs people age with HIV, cognitive problems may become more prevalent and severe, but lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity) have been shown to protect brain health and cognition. We examined the perceptions that older adults living with HIV have about protecting and improving brain health and cognition through lifestyle behaviors. Qualitative data were analyzed from four focus groups (N = 30) of African Americans and Caucasians living with HIV and at least 50 years of age. An open-coding scheme using conventional content analysis was employed. Two results were found. First, many older adults with HIV in our study expressed a variety of cognitive complaints that interfered with daily function. Second, these participants reported few specific ideas about how such health behaviors were important to their own brain health and cognition. Education interventions may help older adults with HIV learn to improve and protect brain health and cognition as they age.Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectDavid E.

Interview and observation results revealed that the subject had typical autistic communication impairments before the music education sessions. A single-case-single-site qualitative action research design was used to inquire into the verbal and non-verbal interactions, singing as well as the reading skills of the subject. Research findings through observations, video recording and interview with the class teacher revealed that the subject had obvious improvement in his verbal and non-verbal interactions as well as his reading and singing skills after intervention. Finally, recommendations for conducting music interventions were given.Communication Responses of an Indian Student with Autism to Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of JIBES University, Jakarta.Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectPerceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectMusic reading is a complex behavior involving both hemispheres in different ways.Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectFunctional asymmetries depend mainly from motor output (single- or two hands playing).Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectMusic reading in pianists is per se asymmetrical due to left hand bass-clef notation.Perceptual and motor laterality effects in pianists during music sight-reading - ScienceDirectForty-six right-handed pianists were tested in a music sight-reading task in which they had to perform on a keyboard. Stimuli were single notes or single triads (chords) presented tachistoscopically in the left or right visual field in form of musical notation or verbal labels. Left-hand, right-hand or two-hands performance was required. Results showed, besides the expected Simon effect producing faster responses for stimuli to be performed with the hand ipsilateral to the side of presentation, a complex pattern of laterality which depended primarily upon the requested motor output. A tendency in favor of the left hemisphere (right visual field, RVF) was observed, this asymmetry being significant only in the single-hand tasks. On the contrary, in the two-hands task an opposite asymmetry was observed with musical notation. Moreover, a strong unexpected role of the bass clef was observed, which penalized left hand performance in particular with LVF stimuli. This effect even overcame the Simon effect, suggesting the presence of a bias in favor of the left hemisphere in musical transposition. Results point to a variegated pattern of hemispheric asymmetries in music sight-reading which depend on both stimulus coding and motor output type (e.g. two- or single-hand performance). A RH asymmetry was observed during two-hands playing with musical notation. Conversely, playing with one hand seems more leftward lateralized. This pattern of asymmetry would reflect a LH ability in simple “core” music reading together with a RH ability in the coordination of simultaneous responses by the two hands.Theoretical foundations and workable assumptions for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry - ScienceDirectThis article offers a theoretical foundation for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry. First, two cases are presented to give an insight into music therapy in forensic psychiatry. Secondly some background information on forensic psychiatry is provided.

Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectApplying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectTo date, there is no music therapy literature specific to bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectSocial learning theory can be applied to understand behaviors of bullies and victims.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectSocial learning theory and the Orff-Schulwerk philosophy can be applied to designing engaging music therapy interventions for bullies and victims.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectResearchers have found music therapy to be effective with populations that share characteristics of bullies and victims.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectBullying is a growing worldwide problem largely affecting school-aged youth and, to date, there is no music therapy literature specific to bullying. As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectIn this letter, we present different approaches for music genre classification. The proposed techniques, which are composed of a feature extraction stage followed by a classification procedure, explore both the variations of parameters used as input and the classifier architecture. Tests were carried out with three styles of music, namely blues, classical, and lounge, which are considered informally by some musicians as being “big dividers” among music genres, showing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and establishing a relationship between the relevance of each set of parameters for each music style and each classifier. In contrast to other works, entropies and fractal dimensions are the features adopted for the classifications.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectRethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectMusicality persists in dementia as documented in empirical and popular sources.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectDominant approaches to understanding this phenomenon emphasize cognition.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectEmbodiment as a potential source of agency has been neglected in discourse on music.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectA relational model of citizenship offers a critical perspective on musicality.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectThis underscores the ethical imperative to more fully support musicality in dementia.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectWith the biomedicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of dementia, music programs, as with other arts- and leisure-based programs, have primarily been implemented as non-pharmacological means to generate social and behavioural changes. We argue that understanding and fully supporting the musicality of persons living with dementia requires engagement with citizenship discourse. Specifically we draw on a model of relational citizenship that recognizes that corporeality is a fundamental source of self-expression, interdependence, and reciprocal engagement. We articulate this argument with reference to the musicality of two residents living with dementia in long-term residential care; one example is drawn from an ethnographic study of selfhood in dementia and the other is from a study of elder-clowning. Relational citizenship brings a new and critical dimension to the discourse on music, ageing, and the body in contemporary society. It further highlights the ethical imperative to fully support musicality through institutional policies, structures and practices.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBoth video games and music can increase physical excitement.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate a higher level than nonviolent video games.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThe excitement of background music interacts with game on aggression.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate more aggression regardless of pleasure level of music.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectPrevious research has shown that violent video game exposure increases aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, aggressive behavior and physiological arousal. However, most of the research in this field has only focused on the “video” aspect of these games, and little attention has been paid to the “audio”. In this study, both background music within video games and the games themselves were used as two independent variables to test their influence on physical excitement and aggression. Physical excitement was measured using biofeedback equipment and aggression was measured using the hot sauce paradigm. Results showed that both music and video games can cause significant increases in physical excitement, while violent video games cause higher levels of physical excitement than non-violent games. The excitement level of the background music interacted with the game content to give a combined effect on aggression. Thus, the present study extended prior findings by showing that background music has an indispensable role in the level of aggression induced through video games. The results also demonstrated that it is both necessary and beneficial to design background music for video games in such a way that it matches the action taking place in the game.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Matthias Rauterberg.Dialogue Possibilities in Guided Autonomous music Studies in Class-teacher Education in Finland - ScienceDirectThis study investigates the kinds of issues dialogical perspective can reveal among teacher students in different learning environments and how different learning environments talk to each other. This qualitative study is based on Burbules’ (1993) theory of dialogue. The research sample consists of teacher educators’ (authors) discussions with one student and with groups of students during and after music lessons as well as teacher students’ responses to a semi-structured questionnaire. This paper considers the recognized needs in the guiding process and addresses some critical incidents in that process as a model that teacher educators can apply to other subjects.Dialogue Possibilities in Guided Autonomous music Studies in Class-teacher Education in Finland - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Future Academy® Cognitive Trading.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectLearning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectAutomated Composition for Music Education (ACME) software has been developed.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectACME has been used as the experiment for the high grades of elementary school.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectAnalyses of learning effectiveness for ACME at various levels were performed.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectThe experimental group using the ACME showed a better learning effectiveness.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectThe paper is mainly to explore the automated music composition experiences for the students in the high grades of elementary school who are unfamiliar with the professional music theory. The proposed Automated Composition for Music Education (ACME) software was developed to help the students to compose the rhythm and melody themselves, while chord configuration and arrangement are automatically generated. Subsequently, sixth-year students of a non-experimental school were recruited to use the software for the completion of its development. Analysis of learning effectiveness at the reaction level, analysis of learning-level learning effectiveness, correlation analysis of the reaction- and learning-levels learning effectiveness has been performed with a significant result. The correlations between each component of learning effectiveness at the reaction and learning levels were also found. Finally the students in the experimental group using the ACME teaching materials showed a better learning effectiveness at both reaction level and learning level, than those of the students in the comparison group.Design of Music Syllabi in Estonian and Finnish National Core Curricula for Comprehensive Schools - ScienceDirectThe fundamental document directing the teacher's action in music teaching on the comprehensive level is the music syllabus in national core curriculum. The research problem is to find and compare the curriculum model, content and pedagogies of Estonian and Finnish music syllabi, examine and construct a general view what the similarities and differences in these fundamental matters are. The research data is the Estonian and Finnish music syllabi in National Core Curriculum of Music and the research method is the comparative content analysis of these documents. The research perspective is evaluative and interpretative focus to curriculum.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectEffects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectBrief training in music or French improved children’s executive control performance.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectImprovement only on tasks that involved executive control.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectFew differences between effects of the two training programs.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectDemonstrates power of short training to modify cognitive performance.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectSeparate lines of research have identified enhanced performance on nonverbal executive control (EC) tasks for bilinguals and those with music training, but little is known about the relation between them in terms of the specificity of the effects of each experience or the degree of exposure necessary to induce these changes. Using an intervention design, the current study pseudorandomly assigned 57 4- to 6-year-old children (matched on age, maternal education, and cognitive scores) to a 20-day training program offering instruction in either music or conversational French. The test battery consisted of verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring EC. All children improved on these tasks following training with some training-specific differences. No changes were observed on background or working memory measures after either training, ruling out simple practice effects. Children in both groups had better scores on the most challenging condition of a grammaticality sentence judgment task in which it was necessary to ignore conflict introduced through misleading semantic content. Children in both training groups also showed better accuracy on the easier condition of a nonverbal visual search task at post-test, but children in the French training group also showed significant improvement on the more challenging condition of this task. These results are discussed in terms of emergent EC benefits of language and music training.The Content Assessment of Pre-School Education Program in Turkey Towards Music Education - ScienceDirectThe pre-school period when the brain is developed the most rapidly forms a strong ground for the cognitive, language, motor, social and emotional development of the child. Therefore, children grow very quickly especially in their first six years of life which is named as the pre-school period and in these development areas, they become complete in every respect with an amazing speed. Thus, this will result in having the child achieve his/her own potential and be a productive member of the society. Education is the head of the most effective processes in shaping, directing, changing and developing individuals and societies. Contemporary education is carried out by being organised within a framework which includes the three general subject areas named as science, art and technique. As for music education, it forms one of the most important branches of fine arts education as an education of art having vocalic and auditory qualities. It has a significant place within pre-school education. In this context, the pre-school education program lastly prepared in 2013 in Turkey was studied and a content assessment was made directed towards music education in this research.The Content Assessment of Pre-School Education Program in Turkey Towards Music Education - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Non-verbal Communication in Music Lessons - ScienceDirectIn our study, which we carried out with a group of primary-school children aged between six and nine, we were interested in how musical language is shaped through group improvisations. Narrative dimensions of improvisation were studied through activities of Orff-Schulwerk, the specific music-movement education approach which, apart from music activities, puts great emphasis on development of social competences. The research was designed as a phenomenological case study. The findings show that, contrary to Orff-Schulwerk premises, children had yet to learn musical language and how to use it. It also turned out that teacher's expectations regarding the use of non-verbal communication are inversely proportional to the successful use of musical language. In line with Orff-Schulwerk's principles, rhythm proved to be the primary musical language parameter, as it was through rhythm that children first reached the sensations of others and reflectively depicted events from everyday life.Non-verbal Communication in Music Lessons - ScienceDirectPeer-Review Under Responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectIn this paper we report on the results of an experiment on the experience of flow and presence while engaging with an interactive music system, the Music Paint Machine. This music system provides a game-like environment in which a musician can create a digital painting by playing an acoustic musical instrument, by moving the body in different directions, and by selecting colours using a pressure mat. The experiment aimed at getting a better insight into the possible relationship between flow experience and presence. Based on the definition of flow as a combination of the highest level of presence (presence-as-feeling) and a positive emotional state (Riva et al., 2004a), we hypothesized that presence has a predictive value for flow. Sixty-five musicians, both amateur and professional, participated in the experiment. Flow experience was measured with the Flow State Scale (Jackson and Eklund, 2004). Presence was measured with an in-house designed presence questionnaire. Results showed a significantly strong correlation between flow and presence. Moreover, the scores for presence significantly predicted the Flow State Scale, and explained a significant proportion of variance in the Flow State Scale. Furthermore, many significant associations were found between flow and presence variables, among which the most significant were the strong correlation (Spearman’s rank) between the naturalness of using the system and the Flow State Scale and between the feeling of non-mediation and the Flow State Scale.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirect► In this study we examine the relationship between flow experience and presence. ► Flow and presence were measured when engaging with an interactive music system. ► We used the FSS-2 for flow and an in-house designed questionnaire for presence. ► Findings revealed a strong relationship between flow and presence.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Giuseppe Riva.August Knoblauch and amusia: A nineteenth-century cognitive model of music - ScienceDirectEarly models of human cognition can be traced to nineteenth-century investigations of brain and behavior. Influential neurologists such as Wernicke, Kussmaul, and Lichtheim constructed diagrammatic models to illustrate current theories of cognition. Language was the most commonly studied cognitive function during this time; however, investigators also studied other cognitive functions, such as music and visual processing. While a number of nineteenth-century neurologists made observations about music abilities in aphasic patients, August Knoblauch, a German physician and anatomist, was the first to propose a diagrammatic model of music (1888/1890). He described a detailed cognitive model of music processing, hypothesized the existence of nine disorders of music production and perception, and coined the term “amusia.” Knoblauch’s model is the earliest cognitive model of music and is largely unrecognized as an important part of the history of neurology, neuropsychology, and music cognition.Creation and cognition for humanoid live dancing - ScienceDirect

This was the first study to examine the effects of exposure to muscular images in music clips on men's body image, mood and cognitions. Ninety men viewed 5 min of clips containing scenery, muscular or average-looking singers, and completed pre- and posttest measures of mood and body image. Appearance schema activation was also measured. Men exposed to the muscular clips showed poorer posttest levels of anger, body and muscle tone satisfaction compared to men exposed to the scenery or average clips. No evidence of schema activation was found, although potential problems with the measure are noted. These preliminary findings suggest that even short term exposure to music clips can produce negative effects on men's body image and mood.Short term exposure to attractive and muscular singers in music video clips negatively affects men's body image and mood - ScienceDirect► First study to examine effects of music clips on men's body image, mood and cognition. ► Muscular clips produced negative effects on body image and mood. ► No appearance schema activation; potential problem with measure.Effect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to examine the effect of group music therapy on brain waves, behavior, and cognitive function among patients with chronic schizophrenia.Effect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectA quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used with nonequivalent control group. The potential participants were recruited from inpatients in a psychiatric facility in a metropolitan city, assigned either to the experimental group (n = 28) or to the control group (n = 27) according to their wards to avoid treatment contamination. The experimental group participated in the group music therapy for 13 sessions over 7 weeks while continuing their standard treatment. The control group only received a standard treatment provided in the hospitals. The outcome measures include brain wave by electroencephalography, behavior by Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation, and cognitive function by Mini-Mental State Examination.Effect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectAfter participating in 13 sessions of the group music therapy, alpha waves measured from eight different sites were consistently present for the experimental group (p = .006–.045) than the control group, revealing that the participants in the music therapy may have experienced more joyful emotions throughout the sessions. The experimental group also showed improved cognitive function (F = 13.46, p = .001) and positive behavior (social competence, social interest & personal neatness) while their negative behaviors was significantly less than those of the control group (F = 24.04, p < .001).Effect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe group music therapy used in this study was an effective intervention for improving emotional relaxation, cognitive processing abilities along with positive behavioral changes in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our results can be useful for establishing intervention strategies toward psychiatric rehabilitation for those who suffer from chronic mental illnesses.Gender differences in the meanings consumers infer from music and other aesthetic stimuli - ScienceDirectMusic can convey two meanings: one referential that consists of descriptive associations, and another embodied that is purely hedonic. We reasoned that consumer characteristics such as one's gender and Need for Cognition (NFC) can affect which meaning(s) of ad background music people use when forming product perceptions. Yet, are such meanings and their use unique to music, or could they extend to other forms of aesthetics? Two studies explore these issues, revealing parallel outcomes when background materials contain either music or graphic art designs: high (low) NFC males are sensitive to only referential (embodied) meaning, whereas females use both meanings.Gender differences in the meanings consumers infer from music and other aesthetic stimuli - ScienceDirectFax: + 604 822 4697.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThe Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectWe propose that the expressive power of human thought derives from a computational system we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectUGF is a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThe language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domainsThe Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThis view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectMany have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectModels for temporal processing often assume rhythmic mechanisms.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition are an emerging theme in perception and attention.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition can either be spontaneous or stimulus driven.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectWe discuss temporal processing in the context of rhythms for cognition.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectTime is often thought to consist of units that cycle rhythmically at different scales (seconds, hours, days, seasons). Accordingly, many models for mechanisms of timing implement rhythmic processes as the neural and cognitive substrate of time. In recent years, neuronal as well as cognitive exploration have revealed rhythmic motifs in the mechanisms governing attention and perception. In this review, we offer a taxonomy for different rhythmic motifs for cognition and explore the utility of this taxonomy in guiding the study of temporal processes.Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectReview of recent developments in mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI)Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectTheoretical background on embodied brain dynamicsImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectOverview on restrictions of established imaging methodsImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectSummary of hardware and software tools for MoBIImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectThe primary function of the human brain is arguably to optimize the results of our motor actions in an ever-changing environment. Our cognitive processes and supporting brain dynamics are inherently coupled both to our environment and to our physical structure and actions. To investigate human cognition in its most natural forms demands imaging of brain activity while participants perform naturally motivated actions and interactions within a full three-dimensional environment. Transient, distributed brain activity patterns supporting spontaneous motor actions, performed in pursuit of naturally motivated goals, may involve any or all parts of cortex and must be precisely timed at a speed faster than the speed of thought and action. Hemodynamic imaging methods give information about brain dynamics on a much slower scale, and established techniques for imaging brain dynamics in all modalities forbid participants from making natural extensive movements so as to avoid intractable movement-related artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we are developing mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approaches to study natural human cognition. By synchronizing lightweight, high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recording with recordings of participant sensory experience, body and eye movements, and other physiological measures, we can apply advanced data analysis techniques to the recorded signal ensemble. This MoBI approach enables the study of human brain dynamics accompanying active human cognition in its most natural forms. Results from our studies have provided new insights into the brain dynamics supporting natural cognition and can extend theories of human cognition and its evolutionary function — to optimize the results of our behavior to meet ever-changing goals, challenges, and opportunities.Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectThis work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research to D.F.

The model identifies the processes of reflection and specifies, based on the challenges of each process, how to support reflection in this context. Expert validation of the model was carried out through focus group interviews with twelve instrument teachers in three different institutes in Estonia. Findings suggest that with minor modifications, the model, developed based on the findings of supporting reflection in various contexts of higher education, is suitable for implementing in music instrument studies.A Model for Supporting Students’ Reflection in Tertiary Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of Cognitive-counselling, research and conference services (c-crcs).Mirror neurons, language, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectBasic mechanisms of the mind, cognition, language, its semantic and emotional mechanisms are modeled using dynamic logic (DL). This cognitively and mathematically motivated model leads to a dual-model hypothesis of language and cognition. The paper emphasizes that abstract cognition cannot evolve without language. The developed model is consistent with a joint emergence of language and cognition from a mirror neuron system. The dual language–cognition model leads to the dual mental hierarchy. The nature of cognition embodiment in the hierarchy is analyzed. Future theoretical and experimental research is discussed.Mirror neurons, language, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirect► Language–cognition interaction, non-combinatorial mathematical model. ► The language–cognition model is consistent with mirror neuron wirings. ► Abstract cognition can only be learned with language ‘guidance’. ► ‘Associationism’ is replaced by a vague-to-crisp language-to-cognition model.Building research in diet and cognition: The BRIDGE randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectObesity has been linked to cognitive impairment, cognitive decline and dementia. Given that 38.5% of U.S. adults 60 years and older are obese and these numbers are rapidly increasing, strategies to decouple obesity from cognitive decline are needed. Innovative lifestyle strategies that may postpone the onset of subclinical symptoms or even arrest the transition to overt dementia in at-risk individuals are critically needed. Poor diet is central to the development of obesity and diet may affect cognition. Adherence to a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Furthermore, weight loss through caloric restriction improves cognitive function. This paper describes the Building Research in Diet and CoGnition (BRIDGE) study, a randomized trial examining the effect of the MedDiet, with and without weight loss, on cognitive functioning in obese older adults. Obese (BMI ≥ 30 and ≤ 50 kg/m2) older adults (≥ 55 years) (n = 180) will be randomized in a 2:2:1 allocation scheme to: Typical Diet Control; MedDiet alone, without weight loss; or MedDiet lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Both MedDiet intervention groups will meet for one individual session and 27 group sessions over an 8-month period. Individuals in the control group will not receive instruction on changing lifestyle habits. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 8 and 14 months.

Emotion feature analytic could be the bridge of cross-media retrieval, since emotion represents the user׳s perspective and effectively meets the user׳s retrieval need. Currently, there is little research about the emotion correlation of different multimedia data (e.g. image or music). We propose a promising model based on Differential Evolutionary-Support Vector Machine (DE-SVM) to build up the emotion-driven cross-media retrieval system between Chinese folk image and Chinese folk music. In this work, we first build up the Chinese Folk Music Library and Chinese Folk Image Library.Second, we compare Back Propagation(BP), Linear Regression(LR) and Differential Evolutionary-Support Vector Machine (DE-SVM), and find that DE-SVM has the best performance. Then we conduct DE-SVM to build the optimal model for music/image emotion recognition. Finally, an Emotion-driven Chinese Folk Music-Image Exploring System based on DE-SVM is developed and experiment results show our method is effective in terms of retrieval performance.Emotion-driven Chinese folk music-image retrieval based on DE-SVM - ScienceDirectBaixi Xing is now a PhD student in the College of Computer Science and Technology (Zhejiang University, China).

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom. Our results indicate that ECG, motion, and glance measurements could be particularly suitable for the investigation of collaborative music making.Using affective and behavioural sensors to explore aspects of collaborative music making - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Henrik Iskov Christensen.The Impact of Cognitive Intervention Program and Music Therapy in Learning Disabilities - ScienceDirectThe aim of this experimental study is to evaluate the impact of Cognitive Intervention Program for Children with Learning Disabilities in collaboration with music therapy. This research consisted from 12 participants, children with ages differing between 6 - 7 years. Cognitive Intervention Program in collaboration with music therapy has been applied to 6 children that are in the experimental group. Other 6 children in the control group received only Cognitive Intervention Program, that was developed based on PASS theory. CAS test on two groups of children was performed after the interventions. The CAS total final test scores, suggests that experimental group resulted with significant difference from control group, p=, 002. Based on the findings of this study it can be suggested that interconnection of Music Therapy with Cognitive Intervention Program enables children with learning disability to be a step ahead in four problem areas, since intervention in these areas is twofold and can cover weaknesses of each other.The Impact of Cognitive Intervention Program and Music Therapy in Learning Disabilities - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Academic World Education and Research Center.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectThe most important function of the cerebellum may be to coordinate motor function so that movements can be performed smoothly, but there are others. It has been shown that the cerebellum is involved in certain aspects of cognition and changes in affect. Also verbal deficits can be found after cerebellar lesions.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectThe cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome is described, and the evidence for its existence discussed; in particular the use of neuroimaging studies. Different areas of the cerebellum have been identified as serving the various functions, and also their connections to the relevant parts of the cerebral cortex.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectCertain conditions merit special attention. The function of spatial navigation needs a major contribution from the cerebellum, and the problems of autism and impaired cognition are no doubt related to the enlarged cerebellum described in this disorder. The cognitive defects found in children with cerebellar ataxia supports its role in learning, and so does the study of music.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectRetired from Manchester Children's Hospitals.The discovery of human auditory–motor entrainment and its role in the development of neurologic music therapy - ScienceDirectThe discovery of rhythmic auditory–motor entrainment in clinical populations was a historical breakthrough in demonstrating for the first time a neurological mechanism linking music to retraining brain and behavioral functions. Early pilot studies from this research center were followed up by a systematic line of research studying rhythmic auditory stimulation on motor therapies for stroke, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, and other movement disorders. The comprehensive effects on improving multiple aspects of motor control established the first neuroscience-based clinical method in music, which became the bedrock for the later development of neurologic music therapy. The discovery of entrainment fundamentally shifted and extended the view of the therapeutic properties of music from a psychosocially dominated view to a view using the structural elements of music to retrain motor control, speech and language function, and cognitive functions such as attention and memory.Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectSeveral recent neuroimaging studies have found that creative cognition involves increased cooperation of the default and executive control networks, brain systems linked to self-generated thought and cognitive control.Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectDefault–control network interactions occur during cognitive tasks that involve the generation and evaluation of creative ideas. This pattern of brain network connectivity has been reported across domain-general creative problem solving (e.g., divergent thinking) and domain-specific artistic performance (e.g., poetry composition, musical improvisation, and visual art production).Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectDefault network activity during creative cognition appears to reflect the spontaneous generation of candidate ideas, or potentially useful information derived from long-term memory.Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectThe control network may couple with the default network during idea generation or evaluation to constrain cognition to meet specific task goals.Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectCreative thinking is central to the arts, sciences, and everyday life. How does the brain produce creative thought? A series of recently published papers has begun to provide insight into this question, reporting a strikingly similar pattern of brain activity and connectivity across a range of creative tasks and domains, from divergent thinking to poetry composition to musical improvisation. This research suggests that creative thought involves dynamic interactions of large-scale brain systems, with the most compelling finding being that the default and executive control networks, which can show an antagonistic relation, tend to cooperate during creative cognition and artistic performance. These findings have implications for understanding how brain networks interact to support complex cognitive processes, particularly those involving goal-directed, self-generated thought.Stay Creative! - Maintaining Individual Potential through Music Education - ScienceDirecthi contemporary education an interest on musical creativity and improvisation has steadily increased. Music indeed offers exceptional opportunities to develop and maintain individual potential. Music education - as an environment and a form of activity - is appreciated as a comfortable and effective ground for studying self-expression.Stay Creative! - Maintaining Individual Potential through Music Education - ScienceDirectIn this article I apply some popular views on improvisation and team work to fundamental music teacher education. I introduce demonstrative examples that reflect jazz history and practice, hi addition, I present exercises that rebuild a connection to creativity and discuss my experiences of this material with different student groups.Emotions induced by operatic music: Psychophysiological effects of music, plot, and acting: A scientist’s tribute to Maria Callas - ScienceDirectOperatic music involves both singing and acting (as well as rich audiovisual background arising from the orchestra and elaborate scenery and costumes) that multiply the mechanisms by which emotions are induced in listeners. The present study investigated the effects of music, plot, and acting performance on emotions induced by opera. There were three experimental conditions: (1) participants listened to a musically complex and dramatically coherent excerpt from Tosca; (2) they read a summary of the plot and listened to the same musical excerpt again; and (3) they re-listened to music while they watched the subtitled film of this acting performance. In addition, a control condition was included, in which an independent sample of participants succesively listened three times to the same musical excerpt. We measured subjective changes using both dimensional, and specific music-induced emotion questionnaires. Cardiovascular, electrodermal, and respiratory responses were also recorded, and the participants kept track of their musical chills. Music listening alone elicited positive emotion and autonomic arousal, seen in faster heart rate, but slower respiration rate and reduced skin conductance. Knowing the (sad) plot while listening to the music a second time reduced positive emotions (peacefulness, joyful activation), and increased negative ones (sadness), while high autonomic arousal was maintained. Watching the acting performance increased emotional arousal and changed its valence again (from less positive/sad to transcendent), in the context of continued high autonomic arousal. The repeated exposure to music did not by itself induce this pattern of modifications. These results indicate that the multiple musical and dramatic means involved in operatic performance specifically contribute to the genesis of music-induced emotions and their physiological correlates.Emotions induced by operatic music: Psychophysiological effects of music, plot, and acting: A scientist’s tribute to Maria Callas - ScienceDirect► Emotions and physiological responses to operatic music were measured. ► A within hyphen subject design investigated the effects of music, plot, and acting. ► Each variable modulated psychophysiological responses in a specific pattern.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectCognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectHorses are an interesting species given the diverse roles they serve in society.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectHorses show great socio-cognitive skills and learning abilities.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectHorse performance is heavily influenced by outside factors during learning studies.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectHorse cognition research has value in a variety of scientific and applied settings.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectMore research is greatly needed on the topic of horse behavior and cognition.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectHorses (Equus caballus) have a rich history in their relationship with humans. Across different cultures and eras they have been utilized for work, show, cultural rituals, consumption, therapy, and companionship and continue to serve in many of these roles today. As one of the most commonly trained domestic animals, understanding how horses learn and how their relationship with humans and other horses impacts their ability to learn has implications for horse welfare, training, husbandry and management. Given that unlike dogs and cats, domesticated horses have evolved from prey animals, the horse-human relationship poses interesting and unique scientific questions of theoretical value. There is still much to be learned about the cognition and behaviour of horses from a scientific perspective. This review explores current research within three related areas of horse cognition: human-horse interactions, social learning and independent learning in horses. Research on these topics is summarized and suggestions for future research are provided.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectImpact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectModel the effects of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectGovernment policy affects environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectRevisit reason moderates the relationship between policy and visitor loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectRevisit reason moderates the relationship between policy and environment.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectOccupation type moderates the relationship between policy and environment.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectTourists' repeat patronage is a prerequisite for sustainable festivals. Past studies have examined tourist cognition, affection, and conation to festivals. Government involvement in festivals has increased during the past decade; however, few studies have examined how government policy and environment quality influence visitor loyalty to festivals. Using sample data collected from 931 visitors during spring music festivals held in Southern Taiwan, this study used a structural equation model (SEM) with latent variables to examine these influences. The results suggest that government policy positively influences perceived environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty to festivals. Furthermore, the results from a multigroup SEM approach reveal that tourists' revisit reason (revisit festival versus other) and occupation type (student versus nonstudent) moderate the relationships between government policy and festival loyalty. Implications on festival planning and government policymaking are discussed.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectYao-Kuei Lee is an associate professor in the Department of Marketing & Distribution Management at Tajen University, PingTung, Taiwan, ROC. His research interests include cultural marketing, Internet marketing, marketing education, and consumer behavior.Time flies with music whatever its emotional valence - ScienceDirectThe present study used a temporal bisection task to investigate whether music affects time estimation differently from a matched auditory neutral stimulus, and whether the emotional valence of the musical stimuli (i.e., sad vs. happy music) modulates this effect. The results showed that, compared to sine wave control music, music presented in a major (happy) or a minor (sad) key shifted the bisection function toward the right, thus increasing the bisection point value (point of subjective equality). This indicates that the duration of a melody is judged shorter than that of a non-melodic control stimulus, thus confirming that “time flies” when we listen to music. Nevertheless, sensitivity to time was similar for all the auditory stimuli. Furthermore, the temporal bisection functions did not differ as a function of musical mode.Music intervention as system: Reversing hyper systemising in autism spectrum disorders to the comprehension of music as intervention - ScienceDirectThis paper seeks to combine the notion of the Empathising–Systemising (E–S) theory and the resulting twist from the executive dysfunction theory in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) in light of music intervention as system.Music intervention as system: Reversing hyper systemising in autism spectrum disorders to the comprehension of music as intervention - ScienceDirectTo achieve these points it will be important to re-visit, nonetheless briefly, the above mentioned theories and re-define music intervention in the light of these.Music intervention as system: Reversing hyper systemising in autism spectrum disorders to the comprehension of music as intervention - ScienceDirectFurthermore there is the need to adjust the executive dysfunction theory to a theory of dysfunctioning executive functions. These notions will create a different understanding of music intervention in this context, allowing the development of future and existing music intervention programs applied clinically. These applications will evolve around a structuralised approach to music intervention as system, proposing five consecutive systems. It will therefore argue the aspects of expanding existing theories in ASC together with the call for generalised interventions to better assess autism from a theoretical point of view. Theories have to be updated in a time of fast and ever-changing development.Designing Personal Career for Future Music Educators: Aspirations, Opportunities, Determination - ScienceDirectThe period between school graduation and coming to the working world is getting into the focus of researchers’ attention with increasing frequency. Researchers have analysed issues related to motivation to choose an educator's profession and those related to career planning. Personal career is understood nowadays as a personal achievement, continuity of constant work and a connected sequence of experience gained in different roles played throughout the entire lifetime. Still, issues related to future music teachers’ personal careers and career choices have not yet been evaluated in a wider context and they are the main issue of the research.Designing Personal Career for Future Music Educators: Aspirations, Opportunities, Determination - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Academic World Education and Research Center.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectEmotional preference of people from different ethnicity would alter multimedia implicit tagging remarkably. It can be speculated that the people from each ethnic group would prefer the folk music of their own ethnicity more than the others. An emotionally intelligent system based on electroencephalography (EEG) is proposed in this study to test this hypothesis. Four channels of EEG signals of 16 healthy subjects from different ethnic groups were recorded during 4 two-minute long excerpts of folk music. Six types of features extracted and a subset of them were selected based on minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The top-ranked features were fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with various similarity metrics. The performance of the proposed method was assessed in terms of F1-score and accuracy (ACC) using random sub-sampling cross validation scheme. The highest performance for the single SVM classifier was achieved by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based RBF kernel which was significantly higher than the chance level. These results approve that the tendency of people from each ethnic group to their ethnicity is significantly reflected in their EEG signals which can be automatically detected.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectNonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectWe designed a nonverbal musical WM test with pitch and timbre.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectThe findings highlighted that behavioral performance was similar between verbal and nonverbal musical sound tests.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectHemodynamic responses were the type specific and showed prefrontal asymmetry in pitch and timbre WM.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectMusical sounds, such as pitch and timbre, have a potential as a complementary to the conventional WM tests.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectDifferent working memory (WM) mechanisms that underlie words, tones, and timbres have been proposed in previous studies. In this regard, the present study developed a WM test with nonverbal sounds and compared it to the conventional verbal WM test. A total of twenty-five, non-music major, right-handed college students were presented with four different types of sounds (words, syllables, pitches, timbres) that varied from two to eight digits in length. Both accuracy and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) were measured. The results showed significant effects of number of targets on accuracy and sound type on oxyHb. A further analysis showed prefrontal asymmetry with pitch being processed by the right hemisphere (RH) and timbre by the left hemisphere (LH). These findings suggest a potential for employing musical sounds (i.e., pitch and timbre) as a complementary stimuli for conventional nonverbal WM tests, which can additionally examine its asymmetrical roles in the prefrontal regions.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectTo conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current studies to determine whether music therapy affects the cognitive function of older people.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThe databases surveyed include PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, AgeLine, Cochrane Library, and the Chinese Electronic Periodical Services (CEPS) as well as the reference lists of the included studies.

The short-term effects of music therapy in Mini-Mental State Examination data for meta-analysis were compiled. A forest plot was constructed using a fixed effect model to obtain a pooled mean difference.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectActive music therapy comprising singing and other musical activities was generally determined to effect a significant improvement in the Mini-Mental State Examination according to individual retrieval studies. However, this study showed no significant improvement in the short-term effects of music therapy when all related studies in meta-analysis were combined. The pooled mean difference was 0.73 (95% confidence interval −0.07 to 1.54; Z = 1.79; P = .07) for using music therapy overall and 0.74 (95% confidence interval −0.08 to 1.56; Z = 1.76; P = .08) for using active music therapy.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThe findings of the meta-analysis indicate that the short-term effects of music therapy do not improve the cognitive function of older people.

In the recent years a new research area of contextual (or situational) music recommendation and retrieval has emerged. The basic idea is to retrieve and suggest music depending on the user’s actual situation, for instance emotional state, or any other contextual conditions that might influence the user’s perception of music. Despite the high potential of such idea, the development of real-world applications that retrieve or recommend music depending on the user’s context is still in its early stages. This survey illustrates various tools and techniques that can be used for addressing the research challenges posed by context-aware music retrieval and recommendation. This survey covers a broad range of topics, starting from classical music information retrieval (MIR) and recommender system (RS) techniques, and then focusing on context-aware music applications as well as the newer trends of affective and social computing applied to the music domain.Effects of active music therapy interventions on attendance in people with severe mental illnesses: Two pilot studies - ScienceDirectThe purpose of these brief pilot studies was to determine if there were differences between active music therapy and passive music listening in attendance rates, durational attendance, and treatment perceptions in people with severe mental illnesses. In both studies, the researchers conducted a series of active group music therapy interventions (lyric analysis, songwriting, music game, facilitated percussion interventions, and singalong) and passive group music listening sessions (recorded music via iPod) each for five days. During the first study, a higher percentage (15.53%) of patients on the unit attended the active music therapy sessions than the passive music listening sessions. Concerning treatment perceptions, participants in the active music therapy condition tended to have slightly higher mean perceptions of enjoyment and comfort than participants in the passive music listening condition. During the second study, participants spent more time in active music therapy sessions than in passive music listening sessions. Participants in the active music therapy condition also tended to have higher perceptions of helpfulness and amount learned concerning managing their mental illnesses than participants in the passive music listening condition. Results may have implications for funding psychiatric music therapy. Limitations and suggestions for future research are provided.Effects of active music therapy interventions on attendance in people with severe mental illnesses: Two pilot studies - ScienceDirect► A higher percentage of patients attended active music therapy. ► Active music therapy participants tended to have slightly higher mean perceptions of enjoyment and comfort. ► Patients spent more time in active music therapy than in passive music listening. ► Active music therapy condition participants tended to have higher perceptions of helpfulness.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectConcrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectA categorization of the concrete-abstract dimensions of musical techniques.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectThe “chain of metaphors”, the echoing relationship between metaphors.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectThe attributes of abstract concepts mapped onto prominent musical features.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectThe multimodal cues that facilitate metaphor realization and interpretation.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectAlthough previous studies on metaphor and music have yielded fruitful results in the past decades, none of them have investigated the complex “one-to-many” relationships between metaphor and music in compositions based on the same lyrics in examining how verbal metaphors are mapped on, transformed into, and combined with the musical/aural mode of the compositions. To bridge this gap, this study provides a detailed metaphor-based and musical analyses to examine the transformation of verbal metaphors in the classic Mandarin Chinese poem “Serendipity,” written by the famous poet Hsu Chih-Mo (徐志摩), into multimodal metaphors in four musical versions.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectOur findings show that the lyrics of the poem have been transformed into the musical mode both visually and aurally through the highlighting of the “concrete images” and “abstract metaphorical extension” of metaphors, providing a method for categorization of the concrete-abstract continuum of compositional patterns and musical techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate the following findings that have not been addressed in previous studies on metaphor and music, especially within a multimodal context:Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirect(1) The “chain of metaphors,” the interactively echoing relationship between metaphors resulting in the coherent and holistic multimodal representation, may be a significant feature distinguishing the differences between metaphors in multimodal and monomodal modes; (2) both the concrete relationships of space and the abstract attributes of emotion can be mapped onto various representations of prominent musical features like increasing/decreasing dynamics, high/low keys, increasing/decreasing figures, dark/bright timbres, and wide or narrow tonal range; (3) the pictorial effect shown in the score and prominent musical features, deemed to be visual and aural cues, function to construct the scenario of the metaphor and to activate imagination, interpretation, and the multimodal esthetic appreciation. In summary, this study heralds a new way of thinking about multimodal metaphor, which could shed light on interdisciplinary studies of the interface between pragmatic multimodal use of language and music and the esthetic experience of art appreciation.Concrete images and abstract metaphorical extensions in the encounter between language and music: Hsu Chih-Mo's poem “Serendipity” - ScienceDirectDr. Tiffany Ying-Yu Lin is a cognitive linguist and interdisciplinary researcher.

Subjects were divided into three groups, first group wastreated with music intervention involved 28 students, second group was treated with music and motoric movement intervention involved 25 students, and 25 students in the control group. The results showed that theattention in group 1 was significantly increased (MD = -1321, p<0.05), in group 2 was not significantly increased (MD = -0280; p> 0.05), while subject in control group experienced with decreased attention (MD = -0443, p<0.05). Music intervention could increase attention by 11.7%, music and motoric movement intervention only increased attention by0.5%, and subjects experienced a significant decrease by 13% in control group.This finding is strikingly unique and perhaps will promote the notion that “two heads are not always better than one”, but clearly better than nothing.The Effect of Music and Motoric Movement Intervention to Increase Attention among Elementary School Studentsin Semarang Central Java - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of the ICTCRED 2014.The Cognition of Spatial Cognition: Domain-General within Domain-specific - ScienceDirectFew would argue against the position that spatial cognition involves cognition. Much of spatial cognition research has focused on illuminating the domain-general processes (e.g. attention, memory, or representation) active in this domain-specific field. In this chapter, we suggest that researchers view this domain-general to domain-specific relationship in the opposite direction. In other words, we review spatial cognition research within the context of its utility for understanding domain-general processes. For a cognitive process to be domain-general, it should be evident across a wide variety of domain-specific tasks, including verbal and spatial ones. Yet, the majority of data supporting domain-general models comes from verbal tasks, such as list learning. Thus, we suggest that considering spatial cognition tasks and findings along with those from other domains would enhance our understanding of truly domain-general processing.Shared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectWhile previous research has investigated the relationship either between language and music processing or between language and arithmetic processing, the present study investigated the relationship between music and arithmetic processing. Rule-governed number series, with the final number being a correct or incorrect series ending, were visually presented in synchrony with musical sequences, with the final chord functioning as the expected tonic or the less-expected subdominant chord (i.e., tonal function manipulation). Participants were asked to judge the correctness of the final number as quickly and accurately as possible. The results revealed an interaction between the processing of series ending and the processing of the task-irrelevant chords' tonal function, thus suggesting that music and arithmetic processing share cognitive resources. These findings are discussed in terms of general temporal and structural integration resources for linguistic and non-linguistic rule-governed sequences.Shared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirect► Language processing interacts with music and arithmetic processing, respectively. ► We investigated whether music processing interacts with arithmetic processing. ► Participants judged correctness of numerical series endings with background music. ► Task-irrelevant chords interfered with the processing of numerical series endings. ► Data suggest shared, domain-general resources for structural/temporal integration.Listening to the calls of the wild: The role of experience in linking language and cognition in young infants - ScienceDirectWell before they understand their first words, infants have begun to link language and cognition. This link is initially broad: At 3 months, listening to both human and nonhuman primate vocalizations supports infants’ object categorization, a building block of cognition. But by 6 months, the link has narrowed: Only human vocalizations support categorization. What mechanisms underlie this rapid tuning process? Here, we document the crucial role of infants’ experience as infants tune this link to cognition. Merely exposing infants to nonhuman primate vocalizations permits them to preserve, rather than sever, the link between these signals and categorization. Exposing infants to backward speech—a signal that fails to support categorization in the first year of life—does not have this advantage. This new evidence illuminates the central role of early experience as infants specify which signals, from an initially broad set, they will continue to link to core cognitive capacities.Syntax in a pianist's hand: ERP signatures of “embodied” syntax processing in music - ScienceDirectSyntactic operations in language and music are well established and known to be linked in cognitive and neuroanatomical terms. What remains a matter of debate is whether the notion of syntax also applies to human actions and how those may be linked to syntax in language and music. The present electroencephalography (EEG) study explored syntactic processes during the observation, motor programming, and execution of musical actions. Therefore, expert pianists watched and imitated silent videos of a hand playing 5-chord sequences in which the last chord was syntactically congruent or incongruent with the preceding harmonic context. 2-chord sequences that diluted the syntactic predictability of the last chord (by reducing the harmonic context) served as a control condition. We assumed that behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) effects (i.e., differences between congruent and incongruent trials) that were significantly stronger in the 5-chord compared to the 2-chord sequences are related to syntactic processing. According to this criterion, the present results show an influence of syntactic context on ERPs related to (i) action observation and (ii) the motor programming for action imitation, as well as (iii) participants' execution times and accuracy. In particular, the occurrence of electrophysiological indices of action inhibition and reprogramming when an incongruent chord had to be imitated implies that the pianist's motor system anticipated (and revoked) the congruent chord during action observation. Notably, this well-known anticipatory potential of the motor system seems to be strongly based upon the observer's music-syntactic knowledge, thus suggesting the “embodied” processing of musical syntax. The combined behavioural and electrophysiological data show that the notion of musical syntax not only applies to the auditory modality but transfers – in trained musicians – to a “grammar of musical action”.Syntax in a pianist's hand: ERP signatures of “embodied” syntax processing in music - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to the study.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectAnalysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectA novel music/speech analysis framework via integration of audio content and functional brain response.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectBrain response features are derived from fMRI data when participants are listening to the music/speech.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectA novel regression algorithm named ITGP is proposed to improve the quality in predicting functional brain response.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectEffective analysis of music/speech data such as clustering, retrieval, and classification has received significant attention in recent years. Traditional methods mainly rely on the low-level acoustic features derived from digital audio stream, and the accuracy of these methods is limited by the well-known semantic gap. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework for music/speech clustering, retrieval, and classification by integrating the low-level acoustic features derived from audio content with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measured features that represent the brain’s functional response when subjects are listening to the music/speech excerpts. First, the brain networks and regions of interest (ROIs) involved in the comprehension of audio stimuli, such as the auditory, emotion, attention, and working memory systems, are located by a new approach named dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks (DICCCOLs). Then the functional connectivity matrix measuring the similarity between the fMRI signals of different ROIs is adopted to represent the brain’s comprehension of audio semantics. Afterwards, we propose an improved twin Gaussian process (ITGP) model based on self-training to predict the fMRI-measured features of testing data without fMRI scanning. Finally, multi-view learning algorithms are proposed to integrate acoustic features with fMRI-measured features for music/speech clustering, retrieval, and classification, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed work in comparison with existing methods and suggest the advantage of integrating functional brain responses via fMRI data for music/speech analysis.The Influence of Progressive Rock Music on Motivation Regarding Personal Goals, Motivation Regarding Competition and Level of Aspiration on Young Students in Psychology - ScienceDirectThe study is focused on highlighting the influence of progressive rock music on motivation regarding personal goals, motivation regarding competition and level of aspiration at young students in psychology.

Evidence from structural priming across music, math, action descriptions, and language - ScienceDirectCognitive processing in many domains (e.g., sentence comprehension, music listening, and math solving) requires sequential information to be organized into an integrational structure. There appears to be some overlap in integrational processing across domains, as shown by cross-domain interference effects when for example linguistic and musical stimuli are jointly presented (Koelsch, Gunter, Wittfoth, & Sammler, 2005; Slevc, Rosenberg, & Patel, 2009). These findings support theories of overlapping resources for integrational processing across domains (cfr. SSIRH Patel, 2003; SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). However, there are some limitations to the studies mentioned above, such as the frequent use of unnaturalistic integrational difficulties. In recent years, the idea has risen that evidence for domain-generality in structural processing might also be yielded though priming paradigms (cfr. Scheepers, 2003). The rationale behind this is that integrational processing across domains regularly requires the processing of dependencies across short or long distances in the sequence, involving respectively less or more syntactic working memory resources (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010), and such processing decisions might persist over time. However, whereas recent studies have shown suggestive priming of integrational structure between language and arithmetics (though often dependent on arithmetic performance, cfr. Scheepers et al., 2011; Scheepers & Sturt, 2014), it remains to be investigated to what extent we can also find evidence for priming in other domains, such as music and action (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). Experiment 1a showed structural priming from the processing of musical sequences onto the position in the sentence structure (early or late) to which a relative clause was attached in subsequent sentence completion. Importantly, Experiment 1b showed that a similar structural manipulation based on non-hierarchically ordered color sequences did not yield any priming effect, suggesting that the priming effect is not based on linear order, but integrational dependency. Finally, Experiment 2 presented primes in four domains (relative clause sentences, music, mathematics, and structured descriptions of actions), and consistently showed priming within and across domains. These findings provide clear evidence for domain-general structural processing mechanisms.Tapping polyrhythms in music activates language areas - ScienceDirectMusic is experienced and understood on the basis of foreground/background relationships and tension created between actual music and the underlying meter. Polyrhythms create tension between a counter meter and the main meter. Previously, we have shown that Brodmann area 47 (BA47), a brain area associated with processing of language, is activated bilaterally when musicians tap the main meter in a polymetric context emphasizing a counter meter, suggesting that processing of metric elements in music relies on brain areas also involved in language processing. In that study, the tension was created entirely by changes in the stimulus while participants were tapping the main meter. Here we find left-hemispheric BA47 activation in response to a self-produced counter meter on top of a main meter provided by an ecological music excerpt. This data indicates that the activation is linked to polyrhythmic tension, regardless of whether it arises from the stimulus or the task.Tapping polyrhythms in music activates language areas - ScienceDirect► Left-hemispheric activation in Brodmann area 47 (BA47) to production of polyrhythm. ► Activation of BA47 is linked to polyrhythmic tension created by stimulus or task. ► Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to production of polyrhythm.Memory structures for encoding and retrieving a piece of music: an ERP investigation - ScienceDirectThis study examined behavioral and neural correlates of expert musical memory, specifically the hypothesis that particular bars within a complex piece of music would serve as structural markers for encoding to and retrieval from memory. Six pianists were asked to learn and memorize a set prelude by J.S. Bach for performance, and to identify bars that they employed for structuring the prelude into component sections. Following performance from memory, the participants took part in a visual recognition memory task, in which single bars from the prelude had to be distinguished from matched new bars. During the recognition task, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, and event-related potentials (ERPs) from correctly identified prelude stimulus trials were averaged according to their hypothesized status into “structural” and “nonstructural” bars. The results showed that correct identification of structural bars was significantly faster (and tended to display higher accuracy) than recognition of non-structural ones. In addition, recognition of structural bars was associated with a significantly greater negative ERP peak of 300–400 ms latency and a right centro-parietal scalp distribution. This mid-latency negativity appears to index processing of stimuli that served as cues for encoding and retrieval of a complex semantic structure, and is qualitatively and conceptually different from other previously identified recognition memory ERPs (such as the “old/new” effect), as well as from the classic N400 ERP. The data support existing theories of expert memory and music cognition.Dynamics of brain activity underlying working memory for music in a naturalistic condition - ScienceDirectWe aimed at determining the functional neuroanatomy of working memory (WM) recognition of musical motifs that occurs while listening to music by adopting a non-standard procedure. Western tonal music provides naturally occurring repetition and variation of motifs. These serve as WM triggers, thus allowing us to study the phenomenon of motif tracking within real music. Adopting a modern tango as stimulus, a behavioural test helped to identify the stimulus motifs and build a time-course regressor of WM neural responses. This regressor was then correlated with the participants' (musicians') functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal obtained during a continuous listening condition. In order to fine-tune the identification of WM processes in the brain, the variance accounted for by the sensory processing of a set of the stimulus' acoustic features was pruned from participants' neurovascular responses to music. Motivic repetitions activated prefrontal and motor cortical areas, basal ganglia, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, and cerebellum. The findings suggest that WM processing of motifs while listening to music emerges from the integration of neural activity distributed over cognitive, motor and limbic subsystems. The recruitment of the hippocampus stands as a novel finding in auditory WM. Effective connectivity and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analyses indicate that the hippocampal connectivity is modulated by motif repetitions, showing strong connections with WM-relevant areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – dlPFC, supplementary motor area – SMA, and cerebellum), which supports the role of the hippocampus in the encoding of the musical motifs in WM, and may evidence long-term memory (LTM) formation, enabled by the use of a realistic listening condition.Texture-Music Interaction in Sculpture Work - ScienceDirectSculpture is the art of creating three dimensional forms by using various tools and conveying emotions and thoughts by means of the aesthetic values created in such way. The work of art that comes out in the end may be a form of art that shows abstract or solid features. Statues could be used to tell about persons and sometimes about emotions. The effect of a statue in telling about the emotions could convert into a description related to the language of the material used, and sometimes it is the texture of the form that strengthens this language of description. Each stage from clay kneading to the appearance of form is completed by sensing the various features of surface and texture by means of the sense of touching. This sensitivity that comes out with the use of sense of touching also shows itself through the appearance of the texture over the surface of the tool. The changes in the understandings of texture line depend on persons or their emotional conditions at that specific moment. The subject of this study is how does a soft tone or hard tone in a piece of music being listened to affects a three dimensional form being worked on. The problem of the research is what kind of a sense does the music or the sense of hearing contribute to the already changing nature of the texture that comes out by the use of sense of touching and seeing. 8 students in Visual Arts Education and there are two working group of this study. The students in Visual Arts Education listened to the “Carmina Burana - Fortuna” concerto by Carl Orff. Also, students were given artificial textures such as soft, sharp, wavy ones as well as the organic textures, and they were asked to use the ones which they have found to associate with the music they have listened to. The students in Visual Arts Education have created textures on three dimensional forms accompanied by the music during which the independent observants observed the application taking notes. The interview and observation notes were analyzed with the content analysis in the NVivo 8 package program, and the findings of the study were interpreted by matrix and modelsHow does background music tempo work for online shopping? - ScienceDirectThis research examines the impact of background music tempo, an emotional stimulus, on consumer attitude in online shopping. The authors conducted two empirical studies based on the same experimental design. The results of both studies supported the study’s main hypothesis: background music tempo positively affects consumer arousal. It also suggests that product category moderates the influence of arousal on pleasure such that a positive effect occurs when shopping online for hedonic products but not for utilitarian products. In addition, consumer trust mediates the positive influence of pleasure on purchase intention. The authors also discuss the managerial implications of the empirical results.Neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectMusic is a multifaceted psychologic phenomenon, and separating the perceptual aspects of musical experiences from other aspects of those experiences is difficult, given music's propensity to trigger memories, movements, and emotions. Given that music is primarily an auditory phenomenon, it is reasonable to assume that the auditory cortex will play a major role in the representation of musical auditory scenes. The primary objective of this chapter was to survey the literature and perform a meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature in order to determine whether a delineation of the lateral temporal lobes emerges in terms of the processing of tonal, temporal, and timbral aspects of musical information. The meta-analysis revealed both overlapping and non-overlapping areas of auditory cortex, with a tendency for melodic and harmonic manipulations to activate areas outside the primary auditory cortex. Regions of the superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus rostral and ventral to the auditory cortex appear to play an important role in the perception of melodic intervals and patterns, and harmonies, but may not play a direct role in maintaining or evaluating higher-order tonal relationships that govern key membership or relationships between major and minor keys.Shared cultural knowledge: Effects of music on young children’s social preferences - ScienceDirectAdults use cultural markers to discern the structure of the social landscape. Such markers may also influence the social preferences of young children, who tend to conform to their own group and prefer others who do so. However, the forces that propel these preferences are unknown. Here, we use social preferences based on music to investigate these forces in four- and five-year-old children. First, we establish that children prefer other children whose favorite songs are familiar to them. Then we show that this effect depends on shared knowledge: children both prefer others who know songs they themselves know, and avoid others who know songs they do not know, irrespective of the target children’s liking of the songs. These results suggest that young children have a remarkably selective sensitivity to shared cultural knowledge. Shared knowledge may be a powerful determinant of children’s social preferences, both because it underpins effective communication and because it is conveyed by others through social interactions and therefore can serve as a marker of social group identity.Learning music from collaboration - ScienceDirectI draw on two traditions of research: the social psychology of collaborative groups, and the ethnographic study of improvisational performance. I outline a general model of group creativity derived from these traditions. I show how the model can be used to better understand musical competence and performance, and I provide recommendations for how music education can take better advantage of collaboration.Different mental rotation performance in students of music, sport and education - ScienceDirectIn this study the effect of long-term physical and musical activity on spatial cognitive performance, measured by mental rotation performance, is investigated in detail. Mental rotation performance is the ability to rotate a three-dimensional object using the imagination. Three groups, each consisting of 40 students, and divided by the subjects, music, sports, and education, solved a psychometrical mental rotation task with three-dimensional block figures. The results showed a better mental rotation performance for music and sports students compared to the education students. Furthermore, the well known gender difference favoring males was found for both sports and education students but not for music students.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectWhen self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectThe Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis is supported in six experiments.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectSocial norms entitle experts to be more closed-minded or dogmatic.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectSelf-perception of high expertise increases closed-mindedness.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectAlthough cultural values generally prescribe open-mindedness, open-minded cognition systematically varies across individuals and situations. According to the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis, social norms dictate that experts are entitled to adopt a relatively dogmatic, closed-minded orientation. As a consequence, situations that engender self-perceptions of high expertise elicit a more closed-minded cognitive style. These predictions are confirmed in six experiments.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectThis research was made possible through the support of a grant from the Fuller Theological Seminary/Thrive Center in concert with the John Templeton Foundation (IH-111). Opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Fuller Thrive Center or the John Templeton Foundation.Liking and identifying emotionally expressive music: Age and gender differences - ScienceDirectAdults and children 5, 8, and 11 years of age listened to short excerpts of unfamiliar music that sounded happy, scary, peaceful, or sad. Listeners initially rated how much they liked each excerpt. They subsequently made a forced-choice judgment about the emotion that each excerpt conveyed. Identification accuracy was higher for young girls than for young boys, but both genders reached adult-like levels by age 11. High-arousal emotions (happiness and fear) were better identified than low-arousal emotions (peacefulness and sadness), and this advantage was exaggerated among younger children. Whereas children of all ages preferred excerpts depicting high-arousal emotions, adults favored excerpts depicting positive emotions (happiness and peacefulness). A preference for positive emotions over negative emotions was also evident among females of all ages. As identification accuracy improved, liking for positively valenced music increased among 5- and 8-year-olds but decreased among 11-year-olds.The effect of music on acute confusion in older adults after hip or knee surgery - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this randomized controlled study was to determine the effects of music listening on acute confusion that is common in older adults after hip or knee surgery. A control group demonstrated greater decreases in cognition on the first postoperative day compared to a music-listening group (F = 8.448, p = .009). In the 3-day postoperative period, the cognitive status of the control group improved; on the third postoperative day, there was no significant difference between the two groups (F = 3.52, p = .075). The music-listening group had higher scores on the NEECHAM Acute Confusion Scale across the 3-day postoperative period (F = 7.28, p = .014).Immediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectImmediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectParticipants (N = 41) were acute psychiatric inpatients.Immediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectThe researchers compared pre- and posttest mood measures utilizing 10 different recreational music therapy interventions.Immediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectResults indicated positive and significant changes in four mood factors after a single recreational music therapy session.Immediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectThere were no significant between-intervention differences.Immediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the immediate quantitative effects of single recreational music therapy interventions on mood utilizing a pre- posttest research design. Participants (N = 41) were acute psychiatric inpatients. Using the Quick Mood Scale (Woodruffe-Peacock, Turnbull, Johnson, Elahi, & Preston, 1998), the researchers compared pre- and posttest measures in participants’ moods with 10 different recreational music therapy interventions. Results indicated positive and significant immediate changes in four mood factors after a single recreational music therapy session: (a) wide awake/drowsy, (b) relaxed/anxious, (c) cheerful/depressed, and (d) friendly/aggressive. There were no significant between-intervention differences concerning mood or posttest measures of perceived helpfulness and enjoyment. From the results of this study, it seems that recreational music therapy interventions can have an immediate positive impact on acute psychiatric inpatients’ moods but the specific type of recreational music therapy intervention utilized does not affect outcome. Limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for clinical practice are provided.Immediate quantitative effects of recreational music therapy on mood and perceived helpfulness in acute psychiatric inpatients: An exploratory investigation - ScienceDirectFunding for this research was made possible through an Arthur Flagler Fultz Research Award from the American Music Therapy Association.Music as a memory enhancer in patients with Alzheimer's disease - ScienceDirectMusical mnemonics have a long and diverse history of popular use. In addition, music processing in general is often considered spared by the neurodegenerative effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research examining these two phenomena is limited, and no work to our knowledge has explored the effectiveness of musical mnemonics in AD. The present study sought to investigate the effect of music at encoding on the subsequent recognition of associated verbal information. Lyrics of unfamiliar children's songs were presented bimodally at encoding, and visual stimuli were accompanied by either a sung or a spoken recording. Patients with AD demonstrated better recognition accuracy for the sung lyrics than the spoken lyrics, while healthy older adults showed no significant difference between the two conditions. We propose two possible explanations for these findings: first, that the brain areas subserving music processing may be preferentially spared by AD, allowing a more holistic encoding that facilitates recognition, and second, that music heightens arousal in patients with AD, allowing better attention and improved memory.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations.

The impact of affects, senses, and cognition - ScienceDirectThe experience of drinking beer can be explained based in a three dimensions: cognitive, affective, and sensory.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations. The impact of affects, senses, and cognition - ScienceDirectProduct experience is shaped by the interaction between the human systems and the product. Human systems include a sensory system to perceive the surrounding world, an affective system that evokes emotional responses to certain stimuli, and a cognitive system that makes meaning and processes information. We hypothesise that experience is a combination between these three systems rather than a linear continuum of hedonic reactions. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a study measuring the experience of drinking craft and industrial beers. A total of 400 consumers were invited to drink beer, rate their liking and select a set of phrases that better described their drinking experience. Results showed no significant difference in expected liking and purchase intention between the eight beers evaluated. However, a difference between beers was observed for the CATA phrases. Cognitive phrases were more frequently checked for craft beers, while sensory, and affective phrases were more frequently checked for industrial beers. A Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables showed that the sensory and cognitive systems were more related to liking than the affective system.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations.

We show how musical meaning emerges as both an abstract and locally situated, embodied discursive activity, in which speech is connected with metaphorical hand gestures and the material world. Multimodality of musical meaning involves not only abstract gesture and speech about musical ideas, but also implies the concrete use of material objects and actions, such as the instrument, the (breathing) body of the trumpet player, as well as reference to the musical score. Viewpoint is a central issue in this conceptual process: both teacher and student constantly put themselves in the shoes of the performer, simultaneously abstracting over and embodying both their own and the other's body-in-music as they perform and both verbally and gesturally address past and future trumpet playing.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectPaul Sambre is an assistant professor of discourse studies and Italian linguistics at the University of Leuven.

Professional musicians consistently report that sound output is the most important standard for evaluating the quality of group performance in the domain of music. However, across six studies, visual information dominated rapid judgments of group performance. Participants (1062 experts and novices) were able to select the actual winners of live ensemble competitions and distinguish top-ranked orchestras from non-ranked orchestras based on 6-s silent video recordings yet were unable to do so from sound recordings or recordings with both video and sound. These findings suggest that judgments of group performance in the domain of music are driven at least in part by visual cues about group dynamics and leadership.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Are left fronto-temporal brain areas a prerequisite for normal music-syntactic processing? - ScienceDirectAn increasing number of neuroimaging studies in music cognition research suggest that “language areas” are involved in the processing of musical syntax, but none of these studies clarified whether these areas are a prerequisite for normal syntax processing in music. The present electrophysiological experiment tested whether patients with lesions in Broca’s area (N = 6) or in the left anterior temporal lobe (N = 7) exhibit deficits in the processing of structure in music compared to matched healthy controls (N = 13). A chord sequence paradigm was applied, and the amplitude and scalp topography of the Early Right Anterior Negativity (ERAN) was examined, an electrophysiological marker of musical syntax processing that correlates with activity in Broca’s area and its right hemisphere homotope. Left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (but not anterior superior temporal gyrus – aSTG) patients with lesions older than 4 years showed an ERAN with abnormal scalp distribution, and subtle behavioural deficits in detecting music-syntactic irregularities. In one IFG patient tested 7 months post-stroke, the ERAN was extinguished and the behavioural performance remained at chance level. These combined results suggest that the left IFG, known to be crucial for syntax processing in language, plays also a functional role in the processing of musical syntax. Hence, the present findings are consistent with the notion that Broca’s area supports the processing of syntax in a rather domain-general way.Cognitive capacity limitations and Need for Cognition differentially predict reward-induced cognitive effort expenditure - ScienceDirectWhile psychological, economic, and neuroscientific accounts of behavior broadly maintain that people minimize expenditure of cognitive effort, empirical work reveals how reward incentives can mobilize increased cognitive effort expenditure. Recent theories posit that the decision to expend effort is governed, in part, by a cost-benefit tradeoff whereby the potential benefits of mental effort can offset the perceived costs of effort exertion. Taking an individual differences approach, the present study examined whether one’s executive function capacity, as measured by Stroop interference, predicts the extent to which reward incentives reduce switch costs in a task-switching paradigm, which indexes additional expenditure of cognitive effort. In accordance with the predictions of a cost-benefit account of effort, we found that a low executive function capacity—and, relatedly, a low intrinsic motivation to expend effort (measured by Need for Cognition)—predicted larger increase in cognitive effort expenditure in response to monetary reward incentives, while individuals with greater executive function capacity—and greater intrinsic motivation to expend effort—were less responsive to reward incentives. These findings suggest that an individual’s cost-benefit tradeoff is constrained by the perceived costs of exerting cognitive effort.Cognitive capacity limitations and Need for Cognition differentially predict reward-induced cognitive effort expenditure - ScienceDirectAuthors contributed equally to this submission.The rewards of music listening: Response and physiological connectivity of the mesolimbic system - ScienceDirectAlthough the neural underpinnings of music cognition have been widely studied in the last 5 years, relatively little is known about the neuroscience underlying emotional reactions that music induces in listeners. Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectFunding: None.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectConflict of Interest: None.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectAuthorship: The author had access to the data and played a role in writing this manuscript.P-444 - The effectiveness of group music therapy to improve depression and cognition status in elderly persons with dementia - ScienceDirectThis study aimed to determine the effectiveness of group music therapy to improve the depression and cognitive function of elderly persons with dementia.P-444 - The effectiveness of group music therapy to improve depression and cognition status in elderly persons with dementia - ScienceDirectThis was a randomized clinical trial design with permuted block randomization.P-444 - The effectiveness of group music therapy to improve depression and cognition status in elderly persons with dementia - ScienceDirectThree nursing homes in Taiwan.P-444 - The effectiveness of group music therapy to improve depression and cognition status in elderly persons with dementia - ScienceDirectOf the 104 elderly persons with dementia randomly assigned to the experimental or control group, 100 completed the study: 49 in the experimental group and 51 in the control group.P-444 - The effectiveness of group music therapy to improve depression and cognition status in elderly persons with dementia - ScienceDirectThe experimental group received 12 sessions of group music therapy of 30 min each.

The mechanism behind the diminished cortisol levels in the effects of music therapy in dementia remains to be determined.“Cognition in music”: Reply to Serafine - ScienceDirectThis reply was written while I was a Junior Fellow at the Harvard University Society of Fellows.“Cognition in music”: Reply to Serafine - ScienceDirectI would like to thank Susan Blaustein and Matthew Brown, who should be considered co-authors of any good parts.Language and cognition - ScienceDirectWhat is the role of language in cognition? Do we think with words, or do we use words to communicate made-up decisions? The paper briefly reviews ideas in this area since 1950s. Then we discuss mechanisms of cognition, recent neuroscience experiments, and corresponding mathematical models. These models are interpreted in terms of a biological drive for cognition. Based on the Grossberg–Levine theory of drives and emotions, we identify specific emotions associated with the need for cognition. We demonstrate an engineering application of the developed technique, which significantly improves detection of patterns in noise over the previous state-of-the-art. The developed mathematical models are extended toward language. Then we consider possible brain–mind mechanisms of interaction between language and cognition. A mathematical analysis imposes restrictions on possible mechanisms. The proposed model resolves some long-standing language–cognition issues: how the mind learns correct associations between words and objects among an astronomical number of possible associations; why kids can talk about almost everything, but cannot act like adults, what exactly are the brain–mind differences; why animals do not talk and think like people. Recent brain imaging experiments indicate support for the proposed model. We discuss future theoretical and experimental research.Shadows of music–language interaction on low frequency brain oscillatory patterns - ScienceDirectElectrophysiological studies investigating similarities between music and language perception have relied exclusively on the signal averaging technique, which does not adequately represent oscillatory aspects of electrical brain activity that are relevant for higher cognition. The current study investigated the patterns of brain oscillations during simultaneous processing of music and language using visually presented sentences and auditorily presented chord sequences. Music-syntactically regular or irregular chord functions were presented in sync with syntactically or semantically correct or incorrect words. Irregular chord functions (presented simultaneously with a syntactically correct word) produced an early (150–250 ms) spectral power decrease over anterior frontal regions in the theta band (5–7 Hz) and a late (350–700 ms) power increase in both the delta and the theta band (2–7 Hz) over parietal regions. Syntactically incorrect words (presented simultaneously with a regular chord) elicited a similar late power increase in delta–theta band over parietal sites, but no early effect. Interestingly, the late effect was significantly diminished when the language-syntactic and music-syntactic irregularities occurred at the same time. Further, the presence of a semantic violation occurring simultaneously with regular chords produced a significant increase in later delta–theta power at posterior regions; this effect was marginally decreased when the identical semantic violation occurred simultaneously with a music syntactical violation. Altogether, these results show that low frequency oscillatory networks get activated during the syntactic processing of both music and language, and further, these networks may possibly be shared.Shadows of music–language interaction on low frequency brain oscillatory patterns - ScienceDirect► We investigated oscillatory patterns during simultaneous processing of music and language. ► Violations in music and language elicited delta–theta power increase. ► Neural interaction was found during simultaneous processing of music and language violations. ► Common low frequency oscillatory networks are involved during processing of music and language.Nonhuman primates prefer slow tempos but dislike music overall - ScienceDirectHuman adults generally find fast tempos more arousing than slow tempos, with tempo frequently manipulated in music to alter tension and emotion. We used a previously published method [McDermott, J., & Hauser, M. (2004). Are consonant intervals music to their ears? Spontaneous acoustic preferences in a nonhuman primate. Cognition, 94(2), B11–B21] to test cotton-top tamarins and common marmosets, two new-World primates, for their spontaneous responses to stimuli that varied systematically with respect to tempo. Across several experiments, we found that both tamarins and marmosets preferred slow tempos to fast. It is possible that the observed preferences were due to arousal, and that this effect is homologous to the human response to tempo. In other respects, however, these two monkey species showed striking differences compared to humans. Specifically, when presented with a choice between slow tempo musical stimuli, including lullabies, and silence, tamarins and marmosets preferred silence whereas humans, when similarly tested, preferred music. Thus despite the possibility of homologous mechanisms for tempo perception in human and nonhuman primates, there appear to be motivational ties to music that are uniquely human.Nonhuman primates prefer slow tempos but dislike music overall - ScienceDirectThis manuscript was accepted under the editorship of Jacques Mehler.Music listening to facilitate relaxation and promote wellness: Integrated aspects of our neurophysiological responses to music - ScienceDirectWellness as a movement for both healthy persons and those with diagnosed diseases has been growing in both popularity and acceptance by consumers and the health industry. Wellness in part includes an individual's positive attitude towards, and active engagement in the health environment in which they function. A focus of wellness can include techniques and methods that people can use in their lives to combat stress and facilitate relaxation. Music as a sound medium has been used as part of wellness programs in a variety of ways, including as a sonic background for relaxation experiences. In this article, the role of music listening to positively affect neurophysiological and emotional responses related to relaxation is examined. Neurological bases of music listening and sound processing are reviewed, with emphasis on how music is processed by the limbic and related biological systems, including endocrine and hormonal responses. Suggestions for how consumers may use music listening in their own wellness and relaxation regimens are provided, including descriptions of which music to consider, where to obtain it, and how to use it.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectA model of online consumer behavior incorporating emotions, cognitions, flow, entertainment, online attitudes and purchase intentions was developed and tested, as well as the moderating effects of need for cognition (NFC) and optimum stimulation level (OSL). Cognitions relate to website functional characteristics, while entertainment relates to its hedonic characteristics. Emotions encompass pleasure, arousal and dominance. Findings indicate that in the context of online visiting, emotions precede cognitions. Among other findings, the dimension of dominance played a major role in the model. The moderating effects of NFC and OSL on the model were tested individually as well as the interactive effects of these moderators. Strong main and interactive effects of NFC and OSL were found. Several key differential paths were identified. Finally, the article provides a description of website visitors based on these personality variables.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectTel.: + 1 315 792 7392.The Mediating Effects of Positive Cognitions on Autism Caregivers' Depression and Their Children's Challenging Behaviors - ScienceDirectCaregivers of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are prone to depression and psychological problems, which have an impact on their children's challenging behaviors. Positive cognitions include specific positive thinking patterns that enhance one's ability to effectively manage daily activities and promote mental health. The purpose of this research is to test the mediating effects of positive cognitions on the relationship between caregivers' depression and their children's challenging behaviors among 117 caregivers of persons with ASD. Positive cognitions were found to have mediating effects on the relationship between caregiver's depression and their children's challenging behaviors in this sample of caregivers of persons with ASD. Nurses are in a strategic position to include in their interventions those strategies that strengthen positive cognitions in order to improve the caregivers' positive cognitions and well-being, which, in turn will have an impact on their children's challenging behaviors.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectMusic Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectPain modulation by music is investigated with fMRI of the brain and spinal cord.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectBehavioral responses showed a roughly 10% reduction of pain ratings with music.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectfMRI showed altered responses to pain with music in spinal cord and higher structures.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectResults suggest that music may evoke activation of the descending analgesia pathway.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectThe oldest known method for relieving pain is music, and yet, to date, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been studied. Here, we investigate these neural mechanisms by applying a well-defined painful stimulus while participants listened to their favorite music or to no music. Neural responses in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord were mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging spanning the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Subjective pain ratings were observed to be significantly lower when pain was administered with music than without music. The pain stimulus without music elicited neural activity in brain regions that are consistent with previous studies. Brain regions associated with pleasurable music listening included limbic, frontal, and auditory regions, when comparing music to non-music pain conditions. In addition, regions demonstrated activity indicative of descending pain modulation when contrasting the 2 conditions. These regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, periaqueductal gray matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord. This is the first imaging study to characterize the neural response of pain and how pain is mitigated by music, and it provides new insights into the neural mechanism of music-induced analgesia within the central nervous system.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectThis article presents the first investigation of neural processes underlying music analgesia in human participants.

Often perceived as petty street musicians, who perform to earn subsistence living, their talent remains hidden, without avenues to become fulltime professionals. This research attempts to bridge this gap by proposing an architectural intervention that functions entirely as a disabled-friendly building as well as enhances the affinity of music creation and learning. The spatial educative environment created focuses on musical rehabilitation for youths of the visually impaired, hearing-impaired and physically handicapped. The centre addresses their plight appreciatively, fusing their disability and talent in a unique symphony.The effect of harmonic context on phoneme monitoring in vocal music - ScienceDirectThe processing of a target chord depends on the previous musical context in which it has appeared. This harmonic priming effect occurs for fine syntactic-like changes in context and is observed irrespective of the extent of participants' musical expertise (Bigand & Pineau, Perception and Psychophysics, 59 (1997) 1098). The present study investigates how the harmonic context influences the processing of phonemes in vocal music. Eight-chord sequences were presented to participants. The four notes of each chord were played with synthetic phonemes and participants were required to quickly decide whether the last chord (the target) was sung on a syllable containing the phoneme /i/ or /u/. The musical relationship of the target chord to the previous context was manipulated so that the target chord acted as a referential tonic chord or as a congruent but less structurally important subdominant chord. Phoneme monitoring was faster for the tonic chord than for the subdominant chord. This finding has several implications for music cognition and speech perception. It also suggests that musical and phonemic processing interact at some stage of processing.Music in dreams - ScienceDirectMusic in dreams is rarely reported in scientific literature, while the presence of musical themes in dreams of famous musicians is anecdotally reported. We did a systematic investigation to evaluate whether the occurrence of musical dreams could be related to musical competence and practice, and to explore specific features of dreamt pieces. Thirty-five professional musicians and thirty non-musicians filled out a questionnaire about the characteristics of their musical activity and a structured dream log on the awakening for 30 consecutive days. Musicians dream of music more than twice with respect to non-musicians; musical dreams frequency is related to the age of commencement of musical instruction, but not to the daily load of musical activity. Nearly half of the recalled music was non-standard, suggesting that original music can be created in dreams.VirSchool: The effect of background music and immersive display systems on memory for facts learned in an educational virtual environment - ScienceDirectGame technology has been widely used for educational applications, however, despite the common use of background music in games, its effect on learning has been largely unexplored. This paper discusses how music played in the background of a computer-animated history lesson affected participants’ memory for facts. A virtual history lesson was presented to participants with different background stimuli (music or no-music) to test the effect of music on memory. To test the role of immersion on memory and its possible relationship to the music, two different display systems (3-monitor display system or immersive Reality Center) were used in the study. Overall, participants remembered a significantly higher number of facts using the 3-monitor display system, particularly if no background music was played in the second half of the history lesson. Conversely, for participants using the Reality Center, significantly higher recall of facts was found when participants listened to music in the second half of the history lesson. Cognitive load/overload and (un-)familiarity with the technology are offered as explanations.VirSchool: The effect of background music and immersive display systems on memory for facts learned in an educational virtual environment - ScienceDirect► 3-monitor display system more beneficial for learning than highly immersive Reality Center ► Music in second half of VirSchool history lesson in Reality Center beneficial for learning ► No music in second half of VirSchool history lesson on 3 monitors beneficial for learning ► Differing results may be due to cognitive overload in Reality Center.Effects of Cognitive Leisure Activity on Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectTo test the hypothesis that a long-term, structured cognitive leisure activity program is more effective than a health education program at reducing the risk of further cognitive decline in older adults with mild cognitive impairment syndrome (MCI), a high risk for dementia.Effects of Cognitive Leisure Activity on Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectA 3-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial.Effects of Cognitive Leisure Activity on Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectCommunity.Effects of Cognitive Leisure Activity on Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectA total of 201 Japanese adults with MCI (mean age: 76.0 years, 52% women).Effects of Cognitive Leisure Activity on Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectParticipants were randomized into 1 of 2 cognitive leisure activity programs (60 minutes weekly for 40 weeks): dance (n = 67) and playing musical instruments (n = 67), or a health education control group (n = 67).Effects of Cognitive Leisure Activity on Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectPrimary outcomes were memory function changes at 40 weeks.

For this purpose, young adults, older adults, and patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were asked to remember autobiographical events in two conditions: after being exposed to their own chosen music, and in silence. Compared to memories evoked in silence, memories evoked in the “Music” condition were found to be more specific, accompanied by more emotional content and impact on mood, and retrieved faster. In addition, these memories engaged less executive processes. Thus, with all these characteristics and the fact that they are activated by a perceptual cue (i.e., music), music-evoked autobiographic memories have all the features to be considered as involuntary memories. Our paper reveals several characteristics of music-evoked autobiographical memories in AD patients and offers a theoretical background for this phenomenon.The involuntary nature of music-evoked autobiographical memories in Alzheimer’s disease - ScienceDirect► Music-evoked autobiographical memories are specific, emotional, and fast retrieved. ► Music-evoked autobiographical memories engage few executive processes. ► Music-evoked autobiographical memories can be considered as involuntary memories.Impaired emotion recognition in music in Parkinson’s disease - ScienceDirectMusic has the potential to evoke strong emotions and plays a significant role in the lives of many people. Music might therefore be an ideal medium to assess emotion recognition. We investigated emotion recognition in music in 20 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 20 matched healthy volunteers. The role of cognitive dysfunction and other disease characteristics in emotion recognition was also evaluated.Impaired emotion recognition in music in Parkinson’s disease - ScienceDirectWe used 32 musical excerpts that expressed happiness, sadness, fear or anger. PD patients were impaired in recognizing fear and anger in music. Fear recognition was associated with executive functions in PD patients and in healthy controls, but the emotion recognition impairments of PD patients persisted after adjusting for executive functioning. We found no differences in the recognition of happy or sad music. Emotion recognition was not related to depressive symptoms, disease duration or severity of motor symptoms.Impaired emotion recognition in music in Parkinson’s disease - ScienceDirectWe conclude that PD patients are impaired in recognizing complex emotions in music. Although this impairment is related to executive dysfunction, our findings most likely reflect an additional primary deficit in emotional processing.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectAlthough a substantial number of research projects have addressed music information retrieval over the past three decades, the field is still very immature. Few of these projects involve complex (polyphonic) music; methods for evaluation are at a very primitive stage of development; none of the projects tackles the problem of realistically large-scale databases. Many problems to be faced are due to the nature of music itself. Among these are issues in human perception and cognition of music, especially as they concern the recognizability of a musical phrase. This paper considers some of the most fundamental problems in music information retrieval, challenging the common assumption that searching on pitch (or pitch-contour) alone is likely to be satisfactory for all purposes. This assumption may indeed be true for most monophonic (single-voice) music, but it is certainly inadequate for polyphonic (multi-voice) music. Even in the monophonic case it can lead to misleading results. The fact, long recognized in projects involving monophonic music, that a recognizable passage is usually not identical with the search pattern means that approximate matching is almost always necessary, yet this too is severely complicated by the demands of polyphonic music. Almost all text-IR methods rely on identifying approximate units of meaning, that is, words. A fundamental problem in music IR is that locating such units is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectThis material is based on work supported in part by the Digital Libraries Initiative, Phase 2, under NSF grant IIS-9905842, by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee under project code JCDE/NSFKCL, and by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC-9209623.

In order to investigate how these different facets of perfectionism are related to coping, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in musicians, we asked 275 professional and amateur Japanese musicians to complete measures of perfectionism traits, perfectionism cognitions, coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. While both facets of perfectionism showed a similar pattern of correlation with coping measures, they were differently associated with effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis showed the incremental validity of perfectionism cognitions in explaining variance in performance anxiety above the variance explained by other variables, such as trait perfectionism. These findings demonstrate that perfectionism in musicians has both positive and negative elements.Traits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians - ScienceDirect► Trait perfectionism is associated with effort and achievement in Japanese musicians. ► Socially prescribed perfectionism is not necessarily negative in Japanese musicians. ► Cognitive level of perfectionism has both positive and negative effects on musicians. ► Ongoing preoccupation with mistakes would increase music performance anxiety.Moderating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectResting state networks (RSNs) are spontaneous, synchronous, low-frequency oscillations observed in the brains of subjects who are awake but at rest. A particular RSN called the default mode network (DMN) has been shown to exhibit changes associated with neurological disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have also found that differing experimental conditions such as eyes-open versus eyes-closed can produce measurable changes in the DMN. These condition-associated changes have the potential of confounding the measurements of changes in RSNs related to or caused by disease state(s). In this study, we use fMRI measurements of resting-state connectivity paired with EEG measurements of alpha rhythm and employ independent component analysis, undirected graphs of partial spectral coherence, and spatiotemporal regression to investigate the effect of music-listening on RSNs and the DMN in particular. We observed similar patterns of DMN connectivity in subjects who were listening to music compared with those who were not, with a trend toward a more introspective pattern of resting-state connectivity during music-listening. We conclude that music-listening is a valid condition under which the DMN can be studied.Moderating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirect► Experimental condition can affect measurement of resting state networks. ► We examine the effect of music with EEG/fMRI using ICA and connectivity graphs. ► Music-listening increases alpha rhythm amplitude. ► Music-listening produces a more introspective pattern of connectivity. ► The overall structure of the default mode network is unchanged by music.Perinatal exposure to music protects spatial memory against callosal lesions - ScienceDirectSeveral studies have indicated that the exposure of rodents to music modulates brain development and neuroplasticity, by mechanisms that involve facilitated hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotrophin synthesis and glutamatergic signaling. This study focused on the potential protection that the perinatal exposure to music, between postnatal days 2 and 32, could offer against functional deficits induced by neonatal callosotomy in rats. The spontaneous alternation and marble-burying behaviors were longitudinally measured in callosotomized and control rats that had been exposed to music or not. The results indicated that the neonatal callosotomy-induced spontaneous alternation deficits that became apparent only after postnatal day 45, about the time when the rat corpus callosum reaches its maximal levels of myelination. The perinatal exposure to music efficiently protected the spontaneous alternation performance against the deficits induced by callosotomy. The present findings may offer important insights into music-induced neuroplasticity, relevant to brain development and neurorehabilitation.Expert music performance: cognitive, neural, and developmental bases - ScienceDirectIn this chapter, we explore what happens in the brain of an expert musician during performance. Understanding expert music performance is interesting to cognitive neuroscientists not only because it tests the limits of human memory and movement, but also because studying expert musicianship can help us understand skilled human behavior in general. In this chapter, we outline important facets of our current understanding of the cognitive and neural basis for music performance, and developmental factors that may underlie musical ability. We address three main questions. (1) What is expert performance? (2) How do musicians achieve expert-level performance? (3) How does expert performance come about? We address the first question by describing musicians’ ability to remember, plan, execute, and monitor their performances in order to perform music accurately and expressively. We address the second question by reviewing evidence for possible cognitive and neural mechanisms that may underlie or contribute to expert music performance, including the integration of sound and movement, feedforward and feedback motor control processes, expectancy, and imagery. We further discuss how neural circuits in auditory, motor, parietal, subcortical, and frontal cortex all contribute to different facets of musical expertise. Finally, we address the third question by reviewing evidence for the heritability of musical expertise and for how expertise develops through training and practice. We end by discussing outlooks for future work.Influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats - ScienceDirectDuring the prenatal period, the development of individual is influenced by the environmental factors. In the present study, the influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats was investigated. The exposure to the noise during pregnancy caused growth retardation, decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and impaired spatial learning ability in pups. The exposure to music during pregnancy, on the other hand, caused increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and enhanced spatial learning ability in pups. The present study has shown the importance of the prenatal environmental conditions for the cognition and brain development.Musical structure modulates semantic priming in vocal music - ScienceDirectIt has been shown that harmonic structure may influence the processing of phonemes whatever the extent of participants' musical expertise [Bigand, E., Tillmann, B., Poulin, B., D'Adamo, D. A., & Madurell, F. (2001). The effect of harmonic context on phoneme monitoring in vocal music. Cognition, 81, B11–B20]. The present study goes a step further by investigating how musical harmony may potentially interfere with the processing of words in vocal music. Eight-chord sung sentences were presented, their last word being either semantically related (La girafe a un très grand cou, The giraffe has a very long neck) or unrelated to the previous linguistic context (La girafe a un très grand pied, The giraffe has a very long foot). The target word was sung on a chord that acted either as a referential tonic chord or as a congruent but less referential subdominant chord. Participants performed a lexical decision task on the target word. A significant interaction was observed between semantic and harmonic relatedness suggesting that music modulates semantic priming in vocal music. Following Jones' dynamic attention theory, we argue that music can modulate semantic priming in vocal music, by modifying the allocation of attentional resource necessary for linguistic computation.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectCreative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectCreativity requires a balance between flexible and persistent processing.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectThis balance appears to be modulated by fronto-striatal dopamine.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectStriatal dopamine modulates flexible creative processes.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectPrefrontal dopamine modulates persistent creative processes.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectDopamine in these areas may relate to creativity in an inverted-U-shaped fashion.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectCreative cognition is key to human functioning yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are sparsely addressed and poorly understood. Here we address the possibility that creative cognition is a function of dopaminergic modulation in fronto-striatal brain circuitries. It is proposed that (i) creative cognition benefits from both flexible and persistent processing, (ii) striatal dopamine and the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is associated with flexible processing, while (iii) prefrontal dopamine and the integrity of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway is associated with persistent processing. We examine this possibility in light of studies linking creative ideation, divergent thinking, and creative problem-solving to polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes, indirect markers and manipulations of the dopaminergic system, and clinical populations with dysregulated dopaminergic activity. Combined, studies suggest a functional differentiation between striatal and prefrontal dopamine: moderate (but not low or high) levels of striatal dopamine benefit creative cognition by facilitating flexible processes, and moderate (but not low or high) levels of prefrontal dopamine enable persistence-driven creativity.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectThis work was facilitated by a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-451-12-023) to Matthijs Baas.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectEffects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy can be effective treatment for blood and marrow transplant patients.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectCognitive-behavioral music therapy may be an effective treatment concerning multidimensional aspects of fatigue.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectExperimental participants had more favorable scores than control participants.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectPatient-preferred live music can be an effective intervention on fatigue.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectQualitative results support cognitive-behavioral music therapy with patients on a blood and marrow unit.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is an under-treated condition frequently experienced by cancer patients, which can negatively affect wellbeing during and after hospitalization. The purpose of this mixed-method pilot study was to determine if and how cognitive-behavioral music therapy (CBMT) might reduce fatigue in hospitalized patients in an adult blood and marrow transplant (BMT) unit. The researchers measured the effects of CBMT on five aspects of participant fatigue using a convergent parallel mixed-method design. The participants (N = 11) were randomly assigned to experimental or wait-list control conditions and completed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (Smets, Garssen, Bonke, & De Haes, 1995) at pre- and posttest. The experimental participants completed a semi-structured interview prior to hospital discharge. The quantitative results indicated no significant between-group differences regarding fatigue. However, the experimental participants tended to have decreases in the mean fatigue scores from pre- to posttest, whereas the control participants had increases in the mean fatigue scores from pre- to posttest. The qualitative data tended to support the quantitative data and indicated that CBMT: (a) cognitively influenced fatigue by increasing motivation and self-efficacy, (b) affectively influenced fatigue by promoting relaxation and restful states, and (c) represented a meaningful, unique, and holistic service for hospitalized BMT patients. CBMT may be an effective intervention regarding various aspects of fatigue in hospitalized BMT patients. Because of the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution. The limitations of the study, implications for clinical practice, and suggestions for future research are provided.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectPostal address: University of Minnesota, School of Music, 100 Ferguson Hall, 2106 4th Street South, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

This may be true of incidental stimuli in online environments, such as adverts on websites. Two experiments (N = 325, N = 331) showed that the mere presence of advertisements with violent content on a simulated Facebook page induced higher levels of aggression-related cognition in comparison to non-violent adverts (d = 0.56, d = 0.71). In a subsequent word recognition task, participants primed with the violent stimuli ‘remembered’ more actually-unseen violence-related words than did the control participants. That is, they reported recognising violent words they had not actually seen. However, priming with violent adverts had no effect on mood or person perception. A third correlational study (N = 131) examined whether variance in the extent of priming could be attributed to individual differences in aggressiveness. Participants’ aggressiveness was unrelated to their scores on the aggressive cognition measure. These studies established that website adverts with violent content could prime aggressive cognitions. Individuals differed in the extent to which they experienced the priming effect, and this was not attributable to their levels of trait aggressiveness. No effects of priming were found on either mood state or person perception.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectEnvironmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectMobile devices enable ubiquitous working in multiple, varying environments.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectExploring a virtual environment affects work performance.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectBeing in a work-related context leads to a more risky decision-making behaviour.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectBeing in a work-related context enhances efficiency in a concentration task.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectThe term ubiquitous working describes the relocation from working in a traditional office on company premises to flexible working in the home or in other environments that were never originally conceptualized for working, such as parks or hotel lobbies. Research indicates that the environment has the potential to influence work performance. We used virtual 3D environments to examine the impact of a work-related (characteristic office) vs. a non-work related context (Tuscan garden) on attention, concentration, and decision making. We assumed that the context would influence cognitive performance. Our results showed that, compared to the non-work context, participants in the work context (1) had marginally faster reaction times in an attentional task (2) were more accurate in completing a concentration test, and (3) made decisions that were more risky. These results suggest that working in a more typical work environment enhances work performance and influences decision making.Effect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of music on pain for home-dwelling persons with dementia. A quasiexperimental design was used. Fifteen subjects listened to their preferred music for 30 minutes before peak agitation time, for 2 days per week, followed by no music for 2 weeks. The process was repeated once. The finding of this study showed that mean pain levels after listening to music were significantly lower than before listening to the music (t = 2.21, df = 28; p < .05). The findings of this pilot study suggest the importance of music intervention to control pain for home-dwelling persons with dementia.Effect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectSupported by Sigma Theta Tau International Gamma Chapter and by a University of Iowa College of Nursing Research Grant Award.Music as a Therapeutic Intervention on an Inpatient Neuroscience Unit - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a music intervention (MI) on physiological parameters, pain and mood states in the neuroscience patient. This study enrolled and randomized subjects to 1of 2 groups, usual care (UC) group (n = 29) or UC plus MI (n = 24). Data collected were physiologic parameters, pain and mood states pre and post a 30 min MI with UC compared to UC. The sample was 16 males/37 females, mean age of 55.8 years, with similar baseline characteristics. There were significant reductions in heart rate (t = −2.1, p < 0.04), respirations (t = −3.4, p < 0.001), perceived anxiety (t = −4.1, p < 0.000), depression (t = −4.3, p < 0.000), and total mood score (t = −4.1, p < 0.000) in subjects who received UC plus MI compared to UC. The inclusion of MI as a therapeutic intervention for neuroscience patients appears to decrease the emotional burden of hospitalization.The relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectThe relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectA systematic review of 76 studies of relations between TV, cognition and behaviour.The relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectOutcomes were moderated by TV content, child characteristics and viewing context.The relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectEarly onset of viewing and inappropriate content are related to negative outcomes.The relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectEducational TV appears to enhance learning, particularly for preschoolers.The relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectRelations between TV and development are complex and require further investigation.The relationship between television exposure and children’s cognition and behaviour: A systematic review - ScienceDirectThe aim of this article is to systematically review the literature studying the association between television viewing and children’s executive function, academic performance, attention, language and play. Using keywords: television, children, infants, attention, language, education and cognition, five online databases were searched. Seventy-six studies that met all the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The findings suggest the relationship between television viewing and children’s development is complex. First, the likely effects of television may depend on children’s individual characteristics, family and social context. Second, the features of television, such as content and editing pace, and the type of exposure (foreground or background) may affect outcomes. Specifically, watching high-quality educational content during preschool years improves children’s basic academic skills and predicts subsequent positive academic performance. Conversely, television viewing in infancy is disruptive to play; it reduces the quality and quantity of child-parent interactions and is associated with inattentive/hyperactive behaviours, lower executive functions, and language delay, at least in the short-term. It remains unclear whether these interactions between television and cognition are long lasting. Future research should focus on the systematic investigation of the pathways that link particular components of television and the type of exposure with individual and contextual factors, to investigate their potential unique and combined effects on development. Researchers must also address the challenge of investigating the diverse and rapidly changing technologies to which the current generation of children are exposed.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectRecent brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the human mirror system, in addition to becoming active while viewing the actions of others, also responds to abstract visual and auditory stimuli associated with specific actions. Here, we test the hypothesis that when musicians read sheet music an associated motor act is automatically recruited in the same way as when we observe the actions of others.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectUsing EEG, we measured event related desynchronization of the sensorimotor mu rhythm (mu-ERD) while musicians and non-musicians listened to music, observed movies of a musical instrument being played and observed a static image of the corresponding sheet music.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectMusicians showed significantly greater mu-ERD than non-musicians when observing sheet music and musical performances.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectOur results demonstrate that the human motor system aids in the process of perception and understanding by forming functional links between arbitrary, abstract percepts and associated acts.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectThis research uniquely adds to the existing body of literature by demonstrating that abstract images are capable of triggering an “action understanding” system when viewed by experts who have formed the appropriate visual-motor association.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirect► This work demonstrates the important role of the human motor system in perception and understanding. ► The data support the general theory that experience allows for the formation of functional links between arbitrary, abstract percepts and associated acts. ► The important role of the motor system in perception and cognition should be considered in clinical evaluation and treatment of movement disorders.Cognitive, emotional, and neural benefits of musical leisure activities in aging and neurological rehabilitation: A critical review - ScienceDirectMusic has the capacity to engage auditory, cognitive, motor, and emotional functions across cortical and subcortical brain regions and is relatively preserved in aging and dementia. Thus, music is a promising tool in the rehabilitation of aging-related neurological illnesses, such as stroke and Alzheimer disease. As the population ages and the incidence and prevalence of these illnesses rapidly increases, music-based interventions that are enjoyable and effective in the everyday care of the patients are needed. In addition to formal music therapy, musical leisure activities, such as music listening and singing, which patients can do on their own or with a caregiver, are a promising way to support psychological well-being during aging and in neurological rehabilitation. This review article provides an overview of current evidence on the cognitive, emotional, and neural effects of musical leisure activities both during normal aging and in the rehabilitation and care of stroke patients and people with dementia.Music congruency in a service setting: The mediating role of emotional and cognitive responses - ScienceDirectWe conducted a field experiment to evaluate the effect of music congruency with the whole atmosphere in a service setting. We adopted a holistic approach and tested Bitner's (1992) model by considering the impact of music congruency on emotional, cognitive responses and behavioural intentions. Specifically, we proposed that emotional responses mediate the effect of music congruency on cognitive responses, whereas the latter mediate the relationship between emotional responses and return intention. We conducted the experiment in a restaurant with two treatment conditions, i.e. congruent and non-congruent music. Our results confirmed the expected mediations. We demonstrated that music congruency leads to low arousal, which creates high pleasure. Pleasure induced by music congruency increases customers’ evaluation of environment quality and service quality, which positively affects the customers’ return intention.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectDysfunctional cognitions can contribute to depression and its maintenance. They may be related to a higher relapse rate and a longer duration of the depressive episode. The relevance of dysfunctional cognitions for acute inpatient treatment of unipolar depression is examined in this study and its variability by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirect222 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were evaluated during their inpatient treatment by assessing admission and discharge depression scores and their relationship to dysfunctional cognitions, using the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS). The relationship between dysfunctional cognitions and treatment outcome was examined. Primary outcome measures were the Hamilton-Rating-Scale (HRSD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectHigher age, depression severity at admission, comorbid personality disorders and recurrent depressive disorders are related with higher DAS-scores at admission. DAS-Scores declined during treatment but to a lower extend than depressive symptom scales (effect size dDAS-G t1-t2 = .31; dHRSD t1-t2 = 2.88; dBDI t1-t2 = 1.38). Higher DAS-scores at admission correlated negatively with the improvement of depressive symptoms during treatment (HRSD: r = −.62; p < .01; BDI: r = −.54; p < .01) and remission rates (HRSD: r = −.65; p < .01; BDI: r = −.48; p < .01). CBT did not additionally reduce DAS-scores compared to pharmacotherapy only.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectDysfunctional cognitions are relatively stable compared to other depressive symptoms and are associated with poorer treatment outcome even in combined treatment of antidepressant medication and CBT during inpatient treatment. Changes of dysfunctional cognitions seem to be a long-term treatment goal, especially because of their association with comorbid personality disorders and recurrent depressive disorders.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectAll authors contributed to and have approved the final manuscript.Walking on music - ScienceDirectThe present study focuses on the intricate relationship between human body movement and music, in particular on how music may influence the way humans walk. In an experiment, participants were asked to synchronize their walking tempo with the tempo of musical and metronome stimuli. The walking tempo and walking speed were measured. The tempi of the stimuli varied between 50 and 190 beats per minute. The data revealed that people walk faster on music than on metronome stimuli and that walking on music can be modeled as a resonance phenomenon that is related to the perceptual resonance phenomenon as described by Van Noorden and Moelants (Van Noorden, L., & Moelants, D. (1999). Resonance in the perception of musical pulse. Journal of New Music Research, 28, 43–66).Evaluation of live human–computer music-making: Quantitative and qualitative approaches - ScienceDirectLive music-making using interactive systems is not completely amenable to traditional HCI evaluation metrics such as task-completion rates. In this paper we discuss quantitative and qualitative approaches which provide opportunities to evaluate the music-making interaction, accounting for aspects which cannot be directly measured or expressed numerically, yet which may be important for participants. We present case studies in the application of a qualitative method based on Discourse Analysis, and a quantitative method based on the Turing Test. We compare and contrast these methods with each other, and with other evaluation approaches used in the literature, and discuss factors affecting which evaluation methods are appropriate in a given context.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectPitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectWe examined how pitch expertise via music or language impact sound discrimination.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectWe measured neural and behavioural correlates of pitch and timbre discrimination.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectMusicians showed enhanced pitch and timbre discrimination in both brain and behaviour.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectCantonese speakers’ behavioural pitch advantage was not reflected neurally.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectMusicianship benefits auditory processing more than than tone-language experience.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectPsychophysiological evidence supports a music-language association, such that experience in one domain can impact processing required in the other domain. We investigated the bidirectionality of this association by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) in native English-speaking musicians, native tone language (Cantonese) nonmusicians, and native English-speaking nonmusician controls. We tested the degree to which pitch expertise stemming from musicianship or tone language experience similarly enhances the neural encoding of auditory information necessary for speech and music processing. Early cortical discriminatory processing for music and speech sounds was characterized using the mismatch negativity (MMN). Stimuli included ‘large deviant’ and ‘small deviant’ pairs of sounds that differed minimally in pitch (fundamental frequency, F0; contrastive musical tones) or timbre (first formant, F1; contrastive speech vowels). Behavioural F0 and F1 difference limen tasks probed listeners’ perceptual acuity for these same acoustic features. Musicians and Cantonese speakers performed comparably in pitch discrimination; only musicians showed an additional advantage on timbre discrimination performance and an enhanced MMN responses to both music and speech. Cantonese language experience was not associated with enhancements on neural measures, despite enhanced behavioural pitch acuity. These data suggest that while both musicianship and tone language experience enhance some aspects of auditory acuity (behavioural pitch discrimination), musicianship confers farther-reaching enhancements to auditory function, tuning both pitch and timbre-related brain processes.Neural mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music: An fMRI study - ScienceDirectNumerous music cultures use nonsense syllables to represent percussive sounds. Covert reciting of these syllable sequences along with percussion music aids active listeners in keeping track of music. Owing to the acoustic dissimilarity between the representative syllables and the referent percussive sounds, associative learning is necessary for the oral representation of percussion music. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural processes underlying oral rehearsals of music. There were four music conditions in the experiment: (1) passive listening to unlearned percussion music, (2) active listening to learned percussion music, (3) active listening to the syllable representation of (2), and (4) active listening to learned melodic music. Our results specified two neural substrates of the association mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music. First, information integration of heard sounds and the auditory consequences of subvocal rehearsals may engage the right planum temporale during active listening to percussion music. Second, mapping heard sounds to articulatory and laryngeal gestures may engage the left middle premotor cortex.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectExperience has shown that therapy using music for therapeutic purposes has certain effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (both functional and organic disorders). However, the mechanisms of action underlying music therapy remain unknown, and scientific clarification has not advanced.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectWhile that study disproved the Mozart effect, the effects of music on the human body and mind were not disproved. In fact, more scientific studies on music have been conducted in recent years, mainly in the field of neuroscience, and the level of interest among researchers is increasing. The results of past studies have clarified that music influences and affects cranial nerves in humans from fetus to adult. The effects of music at a cellular level have not been clarified, and the mechanisms of action for the effects of music on the brain have not been elucidated.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectWe propose that listening to music facilitates the neurogenesis, the regeneration and repair of cerebral nerves by adjusting the secretion of steroid hormones, ultimately leading to cerebral plasticity. Music affects levels of such steroids as cortisol (C), testosterone (T) and estrogen (E), and we believe that music also affects the receptor genes related to these substances, and related proteins.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectIn the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, hormone replacement therapy has been shown to be effective, but at the same time, side effects have been documented, and the clinical application of hormone replacement therapy is facing a serious challenge. Conversely, music is noninvasive, and its existence is universal and mundane. Thus, if music can be used in medical care, the application of such a safe and inexpensive therapeutic option is limitless.Individual differences in music performance - ScienceDirectMusic cognition depends on the existence and deployment of processes for detecting, storing and organizing musical materials according to underlying structural features. Common cultural experiences develop these processes to a certain degree, but specifically designed and supported learning environments are required to achieve the levels of expertise required to perform western art music. Certain motivational and social factors are therefore implicated in the maintenance of activities that promote skill-acquisition, such as practice. Expert musical performance is not just a matter of technical motor skill, it also requires the ability to generate expressively different performances of the same piece of music according to the nature of intended structural and emotional communication. This review examines these abilities and describes how some of them have been shown to have lawful relationships to objective musical and extra-musical parameters. Psychological research is thus engaged in a process of demystifying musical expertise, a process that helps to improve upon culturally prevalent, but ultimately non-explanatory, notions of inborn ‘talent’.Perceiving temporal regularity in music - ScienceDirectWe address how listeners perceive temporal regularity in music performances, which are rich in temporal irregularities. A computational model is described in which a small system of internal self-sustained oscillations, operating at different periods with specific phase and period relations, entrains to the rhythms of music performances. Based on temporal expectancies embodied by the oscillations, the model predicts the categorization of temporally changing event intervals into discrete metrical categories, as well as the perceptual salience of deviations from these categories. The model’s predictions are tested in two experiments using piano performances of the same music with different phrase structure interpretations (Experiment 1) or different melodic interpretations (Experiment 2). The model successfully tracked temporal regularity amidst the temporal fluctuations found in the performances. The model’s sensitivity to performed deviations from its temporal expectations compared favorably with the performers’ structural (phrasal and melodic) intentions. Furthermore, the model tracked normal performances (with increased temporal variability) better than performances in which temporal fluctuations associated with individual voices were removed (with decreased variability). The small, systematic temporal irregularities characteristic of human performances (chord asynchronies) improved tracking, but randomly generated temporal irregularities did not. These findings suggest that perception of temporal regularity in complex musical sequences is based on temporal expectancies that adapt in response to temporally fluctuating input.Perceiving temporal regularity in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceiving speech rhythm in music: Listeners classify instrumental songs according to language of origin - ScienceDirectRecent evidence suggests that the musical rhythm of a particular culture may parallel the speech rhythm of that culture’s language (Patel, A. D., & Daniele, J. R. (2003). An empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music. Cognition, 87, B35–B45). The present experiments aimed to determine whether listeners actually perceive such rhythmic differences in a purely musical context (i.e., in instrumental music without words). In Experiment 1a, listeners successfully classified instrumental renditions of French and English songs having highly contrastive rhythmic differences. Experiment 1b replicated this result with the same songs containing rhythmic information only. In Experiments 2a and 2b, listeners successfully classified original and rhythm-only stimuli when language-specific rhythmic differences were less contrastive but more representative of differences found in actual music and speech. These findings indicate that listeners can use rhythmic similarities and differences to classify songs originally composed in two languages having contrasting rhythmic prosody.Organists and organ music composers - ScienceDirectClinical case reports of patients with exceptional musical talent and education provide clues as to how the brain processes musical ability and aptitude. In this chapter, selected examples from famous and unknown organ players/composers are presented to demonstrate the complexity of modified musical performances as well as the capacities of the brain to preserve artistic abilities: both authors are active organists and academic neurologists with strong clinical experience, practice, and knowledge about the challenges to play such an outstanding instrument and share their interest to explore potentially instrument-related phenomena of brain modulation in specific transient or permanent impairments. We concentrate on the sites of lesions, suggested pathophysiology, separate positive (e.g., seizures, visual or auditory hallucinations, or synesthesia [an involuntary perception produced by stimulation of another sense]) and negative phenomena (e.g., amusia, aphasia, neglect, or sensory-motor deficits) and particularly address aspects of recent concepts of temporary and permanent network disorders.Recognizing group cognition - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we approach the idea of group cognition from the perspective of the “extended mind” thesis, as a special case of the more general claim that systems larger than the individual human, but containing that human, are capable of cognition (Clark , 2008; Clark & Chalmers, 1998). Instead of deliberating about “the mark of the cognitive” (Adams & Aizawa, 2008), our discussion of group cognition is tied to particular cognitive capacities. We review recent studies of group problem solving and group memory which reveal that specific cognitive capacities that are commonly ascribed to individuals are also aptly ascribed at the level of groups. These case studies show how dense interactions among people within a group lead to both similarity-inducing and differentiating dynamics that affect the group’s ability to solve problems. This supports our claim that groups have organization-dependent cognitive capacities that go beyond the simple aggregation of the cognitive capacities of individuals. Group cognition is thus an emergent phenomenon in the sense of Wimsatt (1986). We further argue that anybody who rejects our strategy for showing that cognitive properties can be instantiated at multiple levels in the organizational hierarchy on a priori grounds is a “demergentist,” and thus incurs the burden of proof for explaining why cognitive properties are “stuck” at a certain level of organizational structure. Finally, we show that our analysis of group cognition escapes the “coupling-constitution” charge that has been leveled against the extended mind thesis (Adams & Aizawa, 2008).Joint music making promotes prosocial behavior in 4-year-old children - ScienceDirectHumans are the only primates that make music. But the evolutionary origins and functions of music are unclear. Given that in traditional cultures music making and dancing are often integral parts of important group ceremonies such as initiation rites, weddings or preparations for battle, one hypothesis is that music evolved into a tool that fosters social bonding and group cohesion, ultimately increasing prosocial in-group behavior and cooperation. Here we provide support for this hypothesis by showing that joint music making among 4-year-old children increases subsequent spontaneous cooperative and helpful behavior, relative to a carefully matched control condition with the same level of social and linguistic interaction but no music. Among other functional mechanisms, we propose that music making, including joint singing and dancing, encourages the participants to keep a constant audiovisual representation of the collective intention and shared goal of vocalizing and moving together in time — thereby effectively satisfying the intrinsic human desire to share emotions, experiences and activities with others.Joint music making promotes prosocial behavior in 4-year-old children - ScienceDirectAuthor contributions: S.

Previous research using the attentional blink paradigm has indicated that listening to music can reduce failures of conscious awareness. It was proposed that listening to music would decrease IB by reducing observers’ frequency of task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs). Observers completed an IB task that varied both visual and auditory demands. Listening to music was associated with significantly lower IB, but only when observers actively attended to the music. Follow-up experiments suggest this was due to the distracting qualities of the audio task. The results also suggest a complex relationship between IB and TUTs: during demanding tasks, as predicted, noticers of the unexpected stimulus reported fewer TUTs than non-noticers. During less demanding tasks, however, noticers reported more TUTs than non-noticers.Attending to music decreases inattentional blindness - ScienceDirect► Inattentional blindness (IB) involves the failure to notice unexpected stimuli. ► We examined the effect of listening to music on IB. ► Simply listening to music does not affect IB or primary task performance. ► Actively attending and detecting tones in the music significantly reduced IB rates.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a strong early predictor of Alzheimer’s disease, is associated with significant health and neuropsychiatric burden, and may represent a critical therapeutic window for intervention. However, adults with SCD rarely seek medical care.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectAlthough simple home-based mind-body therapies such as meditation and music listening may hold promise for improving outcomes this population, studies are lacking.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectIn this feasibility study of community-dwelling older adults with SCD, enrollment was robust, retention and compliance in both groups were excellent, and satisfaction with both programs was high.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectThese findings suggest that these simple home-based mind-body therapies were well-accepted and the practices are feasible for older adults experiencing early memory loss.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectIn this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of two simple home-based relaxation programs in adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline, a strong predictor of Alzheimer's disease.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectSixty participants were randomized to a beginner Kirtan Kriya meditation (KK) program or a music listening (ML) program. Participants were asked to practice 12 min daily for the first 12 weeks, then as often as they liked for the following 3 months. Participants underwent assessments at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months to evaluate changes in key outcomes. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated by measuring recruitment and retention rates, assessment visit attendance, practice adherence, and treatment expectancy; exit questionnaires completed at 12 weeks and 6 months provided additional data regarding participant experience with the study, perceived barriers to and facilitators of practice, reasons for drop-out, and views regarding the assigned intervention.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectFifty-three participants (88%) completed the 6 month study. Adherence in both groups was excellent, with participants completing 93% (91% KK, 94% ML) of sessions on average in the first 12 weeks, and 71% (68% KK, 74% ML) during the 3 month, practice-optional, follow-up period. At week 12, over 80% of participants indicated they were likely to continue practicing following study completion. Responses to both structured and open-ended exit questionnaire items also suggested high satisfaction with both programs.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectFindings of this RCT of a beginner meditation practice and a simple ML program suggest that both programs were well accepted and the practices are feasible in adults with early memory loss.Brain on music kills pain of workouts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Towards a neural basis of music-evoked emotions - ScienceDirectMusic is capable of evoking exceptionally strong emotions and of reliably affecting the mood of individuals. Functional neuroimaging and lesion studies show that music-evoked emotions can modulate activity in virtually all limbic and paralimbic brain structures. These structures are crucially involved in the initiation, generation, detection, maintenance, regulation and termination of emotions that have survival value for the individual and the species. Therefore, at least some music-evoked emotions involve the very core of evolutionarily adaptive neuroaffective mechanisms. Because dysfunctions in these structures are related to emotional disorders, a better understanding of music-evoked emotions and their neural correlates can lead to a more systematic and effective use of music in therapy.Elements of Mental Training in Music - ScienceDirectMental training typically takes place without an instrument or the physical act of playing, and focuses on a particular activity, a conscious guiding of that activity, as well as on incorporating an emotional experience of that activity. Previous research (Immonen, 2007) showed that both modes of practicing, mental as well as physical, involve three important elements: planning, realization, and evaluation of the practice. In music, mental training aims at the most ideally possible act of playing and the creation of a musical event. The research problem is to find out the pianist carries out the mental training. The research data was collected through the interviews of four highly talented pianists of the Sibelius Academy.Music to my eyes: Cross-modal interactions in the perception of emotions in musical performance - ScienceDirectWe investigate non-verbal communication through expressive body movement and musical sound, to reveal higher cognitive processes involved in the integration of emotion from multiple sensory modalities. Participants heard, saw, or both heard and saw recordings of a Stravinsky solo clarinet piece, performed with three distinct expressive styles: restrained, standard, and exaggerated intention. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to rate each performance on 19 different emotional qualities. The data analysis revealed that variations in expressive intention had their greatest impact when the performances could be seen; the ratings from participants who could only hear the performances were the same across the three expressive styles. Evidence was also found for an interaction effect leading to an emergent property, intensity of positive emotion, when participants both heard and saw the musical performances. An exploratory factor analysis revealed orthogonal dimensions for positive and negative emotions, which may account for the subjective experience that many listeners report of having multi-valent or complex reactions to music, such as “bittersweet.”Motor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectMotor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectAction-perception circuits, APCs, are crucial for acting and action understanding.Motor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectAttention can be realized by regulation and control acting upon a system of APCs.Motor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectMemory/decisions can be modeled as sustained/spontaneous APC activation.Motor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectMeaning can be understood in terms of interlinked APCs.Motor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectNeuropragmatic mechanisms can be modeled by APC sequence structures.Motor cognition–motor semantics: Action perception theory of cognition and communication - ScienceDirectA new perspective on cognition views cortical cell assemblies linking together knowledge about actions and perceptions not only as the vehicles of integrated action and perception processing but, furthermore, as a brain basis for a wide range of higher cortical functions, including attention, meaning and concepts, sequences, goals and intentions, and even communicative social interaction. This article explains mechanisms relevant to mechanistic action perception theory, points to concrete neuronal circuits in brains along with artificial neuronal network simulations, and summarizes recent brain imaging and other experimental data documenting the role of action perception circuits in cognition, language and communication.The role of activity engagement in the relations between Openness/Intellect and cognition - ScienceDirectThe current project investigated why people with high levels of Openness/Intellect tend to have higher levels of cognitive functioning than people with lower levels of Openness/Intellect. We hypothesized that the positive relationship between Openness/Intellect and cognition might be attributable to more open people being more likely to engage in cognitively stimulating activities that are beneficial for cognitive functioning. Three conceptualizations of activity engagement based on: (a) self ratings of duration and intensity of engagement; (b) perceived routineness of one’s activities; and (c) disposition to engage in cognitively stimulating activities, were investigated as possible mediators of the Openness/Intellect–cognition relations. Although several of the relevant simple correlations were of moderate size and statistically significant, we found little evidence that activity engagement mediated the relations between Openness/Intellect and cognition.The structural neuroanatomy of music emotion recognition: Evidence from frontotemporal lobar degeneration - ScienceDirectDespite growing clinical and neurobiological interest in the brain mechanisms that process emotion in music, these mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) frequently exhibit clinical syndromes that illustrate the effects of breakdown in emotional and social functioning. Here we investigated the neuroanatomical substrate for recognition of musical emotion in a cohort of 26 patients with FTLD (16 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, bvFTD, 10 with semantic dementia, SemD) using voxel-based morphometry. On neuropsychological evaluation, patients with FTLD showed deficient recognition of canonical emotions (happiness, sadness, anger and fear) from music as well as faces and voices compared with healthy control subjects. Impaired recognition of emotions from music was specifically associated with grey matter loss in a distributed cerebral network including insula, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal and more posterior temporal and parietal cortices, amygdala and the subcortical mesolimbic system. This network constitutes an essential brain substrate for recognition of musical emotion that overlaps with brain regions previously implicated in coding emotional value, behavioural context, conceptual knowledge and theory of mind. Musical emotion recognition may probe the interface of these processes, delineating a profile of brain damage that is essential for the abstraction of complex social emotions.The structural neuroanatomy of music emotion recognition: Evidence from frontotemporal lobar degeneration - ScienceDirect► Emotion recognition from music is impaired in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ► This deficit is associated with atrophy in a distributed cerebral network. ► This network includes cortical and mesolimbic areas likely to code social emotions.Source localization of the effects of Persian classical music forms on the brain waves by QEEG - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study is investigation of the effects of Persian classical music forms on the brain waves and areas. Main tool was QEEG that registers brain waves. Independent variables include four classical music forms: Pishdaramad, Chaharmezrab, Reng and Avaz that their effects have been investigated on the 12 right handed subjects. The results indicated significant differences in the effects of Pishdaramad form on the theta band while it could affect on different brain areas in comparison with other music forms including the increase of activity in Superior Frontal Gyrus and Precentral Gyrus areas in comparison with noise and Avaz and decrease of activity on Postcentral Gyrus and Supramarginal Gyrus areas in comparison with Chaharmezrab and Reng. The results concluded from rhythmic changes in each of music forms. In other word the increase of rhythm speed can raise the brain activity. Also the results of this study shows important of frontal area during the processing of emotional music.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectThe payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectThe cognitive dissonance theory serves as an efficient theoretical framework.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectOur sample is representative of all strata of society.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectDifferences among relevant types of downloaders are identified.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectResults can help improve the effectiveness of anti-piracy campaigns.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectThis study examines which individual characteristics help explain the differences among the groups of downloaders defined according to three common payment patterns: Downloaders who never pay, downloaders who always pay, and the eclectic downloaders who only pay at times. One distinctive characteristic for each group is theoretically hypothesized within the cognitive dissonance framework and empirically confirmed for both movie and music downloading: A more negative attitude towards newness distinguishes downloaders who never pay, a shorter Internet use history distinguishes downloaders who always pay, and participation in a greater breadth of online activities distinguishes eclectic downloaders. By contrast, neither demographics nor factors related to movie (music) interests help explain the differences among the groups of movie (music) downloaders. Both the theoretical framework and the empirical evidence might be used to improve the effectiveness of anti-piracy campaigns by adapting their messages to the specific characteristics and expected reactions of each group of downloaders.Specific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectMigraine and tension-type headache have a high prevalence in children and adolescents. In addition to common pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, music therapy has been shown to be efficient in the prophylaxis of pediatric migraine. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of specific music therapy techniques in the treatment of adolescents with primary headache (tension-type headache and migraine). A prospective, randomized, attention-placebo-controlled parallel group trial was conducted. Following an 8-week baseline, patients were randomized to either music therapy (n = 40) or a rhythm pedagogic program (n = 38) designed as an “attention placebo” over 6 sessions within 8 weeks. Reduction of both headache frequency and intensity after treatment (8-week postline) as well as 6 months after treatment were taken as the efficacy variables. Treatments were delivered in equal dose and frequency by the same group of therapists. Data analysis of subjects completing the protocol showed that neither treatment was superior to the other at any point of measurement (posttreatment and follow-up). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no impact of drop-out on these results. Both groups showed a moderate mean reduction of headache frequency posttreatment of about 20%, but only small numbers of responders (50% frequency reduction). Follow-up data showed no significant deteriorations or improvements.Specific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectThis article presents a randomized placebo-controlled trial on music therapy in the treatment of adolescents with frequent primary headache. Music therapy is not superior to an attention placebo within this study. These results draw attention to the need of providing adequate controls within therapeutic trials in the treatment of pain.Specific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectThe authors gratefully acknowledge funding granted by the Else-Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung and the SRH Förderstiftung Heidelberg.Specific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectThe authors declare no conflict of interest; all authors are listed and all have contributed substantially to the manuscript.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectThe payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectThe cognitive dissonance theory serves as an efficient theoretical framework.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectOur sample is representative of all strata of society.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectDifferences among relevant types of downloaders are identified.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectResults can help improve the effectiveness of anti-piracy campaigns.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectThis study examines which individual characteristics help explain the differences among the groups of downloaders defined according to three common payment patterns: Downloaders who never pay, downloaders who always pay, and the eclectic downloaders who only pay at times.

The duration and intensity of musicians’ training – far greater than that of most educational or rehabilitation programs – provides a useful model to test the extent to which skills acquired in one particular context (music) generalize to different domains. Here, we asked whether the instrument-specific and more instrument-general skills acquired during professional violinists’ and pianists’ training would generalize to superior performance on a wide range of analogous (largely non-musical) skills, when compared to closely matched non-musicians. Violinists and pianists outperformed non-musicians on fine-grained auditory psychophysical measures, but surprisingly did not differ from each other, despite the different demands of their instruments. Musician groups did differ on a tuning system perception task: violinists showed clearest biases towards the tuning system specific to their instrument, suggesting that long-term experience leads to selective perceptual benefits given a training-relevant context. However, we found only weak evidence of group differences in non-musical skills, with musicians differing marginally in one measure of sustained auditory attention, but not significantly on auditory scene analysis or multi-modal sequencing measures. Further, regression analyses showed that this sustained auditory attention metric predicted more variance in one auditory psychophysical measure than did musical expertise. Our findings suggest that specific musical expertise may yield distinct perceptual outcomes within contexts close to the area of training. Generalization of expertise to relevant cognitive domains may be less clear, particularly where the task context is non-musical.The effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectResearchers are increasingly recognizing the role of culture as a source of variation in many phenomena of central importance to consumer research. This review addresses a gap in cross-cultural consumer behavior literature by providing a review and conceptual analysis of the effects of culture on pre-behavioral processes (perception and cognition). The article highlights a series of important perceptual and cognitive differences across cultures and offers a new perspective of framing these differences among cultures—that of “culturally conditioned” perceptual and cognitive orientations. The article addresses several theoretical issues and suggests directions for future research as well as managerial implications.The effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectThe authors gratefully acknowledge the suggestions and comments of two anonymous reviewers and the Special Issue Editor.Social Cognition in Individuals With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: Recent Advances and Trends in Research - ScienceDirectThis chapter provides an overview of recent research on social cognition and social functioning in people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs), with a particular focus on neurodevelopmental disorders associated with distinctive social-cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. We review the main experimental paradigms that have been used to probe social cognition in both typically and atypically developing populations and discuss findings primarily from research on two neurodevelopmental disorders that have been extensively studied in the last 3 decades: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and William's syndrome (WS). Viewed in the past as diametric opposites in their social phenotypes, the two disorders have been intensely researched for their potential to provide insights into the neurocognitive bases of sociocognitive capacities and ultimately into the neurogenetic underpinnings of the “social mind.” The findings reviewed in this chapter convey a mixed and sometimes contradictory account of commonalities and differences in sociocognitive abilities between and within syndrome, underscoring the need to further explore, within an etiology-based framework, individual differences, developmental trajectories, links with genetic variation, and experiential factors to solve the many puzzles of social cognition in people with IDD.Emotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectThis paper reviews the use of music as an adjuvant to the control of pain, especially in medical procedures. Surgery causes stress and anxiety that exacerbates the experience of pain. Self-report of and physiological measures on post-surgical patients indicate that music therapy or music stimulation reduces the perception of pain, both alone and when part of a multimodal pain management program, and can reduce the need for pharmaceutical interventions. However, multimodal pain therapy, including non-pharmacological interventions after surgery, is still rare in medical practice. We summarize how music can enhance medical therapies and can be used as an adjuvant with other pain-management programs to increase the effectiveness of those therapies. As summarized, we currently know that musical pieces chosen by the patient are commonly, but not always, more effective than pieces chosen by another person. Further research should focus both on finding the specific indications and contra-indications of music therapy and on the biological and neurological pathways responsible for those findings (related evidence has implicated brain opioid and oxytocin mechanisms in affective changes evoked by music). In turn, these findings will allow medical investigators and practitioners to design guidelines and reliable, standardized applications for this promising method of pain management in modern medicine.Emotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirect► The multimodal influences of music on psychological functions are discussed. ► Music therapy or music stimulation reduces the perception of pain. ► Music can be used for pain relief promoting multimodal pain therapy in clinical settings. ► Guidelines and standardized applications for this promising multimodal method of pain management need to be formulated.Aesthetic judgments of music in experts and laypersons — An ERP study - ScienceDirectWe investigated whether music experts and laypersons differ with regard to aesthetic evaluation of musical sequences. 16 music experts and 16 music laypersons judged the aesthetic value (beauty judgment task) as well as the harmonic correctness (correctness judgment task) of chord sequences. The sequences consisted of five chords with the final chord sounding congruous, ambiguous or incongruous relative to the harmonic context established by the preceding four chords. On behavioural measures, few differences were observed between experts and laypersons. However, several differences in event-related potential (ERP) parameters were observed in auditory, cognitive and aesthetic processing of chord cadences between experts and laypersons. First, established ERP effects known to reflect the processing of harmonic rule violation were investigated. Here, differences between the groups were observed in the processing of the mild violation — experts and laypersons differed in their early brain responses to the beginning of the chord sequence. Furthermore, ERP data indicated distinctions between experts and laypersons in aesthetic evaluation at three different stages. Firstly, during the interval of task-cue presentation, a stronger contingent negative variation (CNV) to the beauty judgment task was observed for experts, indicating that experts invest more effort into preparation for aesthetic processes than into correctness judgments. Secondly, during the first four chords, preparation for the correctness judgment required more exertion on the laypersons' side. Thirdly, during the last chord, laypersons showed a larger late and widespread positivity for the beauty compared to the correctness judgment, indicating a stronger reliance on internal affective states while forming a judgment.Music, memory, and Alzheimer’s disease: is music recognition spared in dementia, and how can it be assessed? - ScienceDirectDespite intriguing and suggestive clinical observations, no formal research has assessed the possible sparing of musical recognition and memory in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). A case study is presented of an 84-year old woman with severe cognitive impairment implicating AD, but for whom music recognition and memory, according to her caregivers, appeared to be spared. The hypotheses addressed were, first, that memory for familiar music may be spared in dementia, and second, that musical recognition and memory may be reliably assessed with existing tests if behavioral observation is employed to overcome the problem of verbal or written communication.Music, memory, and Alzheimer’s disease: is music recognition spared in dementia, and how can it be assessed? - ScienceDirectOur hypotheses were stimulated by the patient EN, for whom diagnosis of AD became probable in 2000. With severe problems in memory, language, and cognition, she now has a mini-mental status score of 8 (out of 30) and is unable to understand or recall standard instructions. In order to assess her music recognition abilities, three tests from the previous literature were adapted for behavioral observation. Two tests involved the discrimination of familiar melodies from unfamiliar melodies. The third involved the detection of distortions (“wrong” notes) in familiar melodies and discrimination of distorted melodies from melodies correctly reproduced. Test melodies were presented to EN on a CD player and her responses were observed by two test administrators. EN responded to familiar melodies by singing along, usually with the words, and often continuing to sing after the stimulus had stopped. She never responded to the unfamiliar melodies. She responded to distorted melodies with facial expressions – surprise, laughter, a frown, or an exclamation, “Oh, dear!”; she never responded in this way to the undistorted melodies. Allowing these responses as indicators of detection, the results for EN were in the normal or near normal range of scores for elderly controls. As well, lyrics to familiar melodies, spoken in a conversational voice without rhythmic or pitch clues, often prompted EN to sing the tune that correctly accompanied the lyrics.Music, memory, and Alzheimer’s disease: is music recognition spared in dementia, and how can it be assessed? - ScienceDirectEN’s results provide encouraging support for our hypotheses that sparing of musical memory may be a feature of some forms of dementia and that it may be reliably and quantitatively assessed through behavioral observation. The contrast between EN’s response to music and her mini-mental status is dramatic.Music, memory, and Alzheimer’s disease: is music recognition spared in dementia, and how can it be assessed? - ScienceDirectThe article concludes with several considerations why music may be preserved in dementia and suggestions to guide future research.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThe role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThis synthesis of current research characterizes the functional roles of the PHC.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectContextual associative processing is proposed as the core function of this region.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThis proposal unifies findings for the PHC, creating convergence for future research.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThe parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has been associated with many cognitive processes, including visuospatial processing and episodic memory. To characterize the role of PHC in cognition, a framework is required that unifies these disparate processes. An overarching account was proposed whereby the PHC is part of a network of brain regions that processes contextual associations. Contextual associations are the principal element underlying many higher-level cognitive processes, and thus are suitable for unifying the PHC literature. Recent findings are reviewed that provide support for the contextual associations account of PHC function. In addition to reconciling a vast breadth of literature, the synthesis presented expands the implications of the proposed account and gives rise to new and general questions about context and cognition.The capacity for music: What is it, and what’s special about it? - ScienceDirectWe explore the capacity for music in terms of five questions: (1) What cognitive structures are invoked by music? (2) What are the principles that create these structures? (3) How do listeners acquire these principles? (4) What pre-existing resources make such acquisition possible? (5) Which aspects of these resources are specific to music, and which are more general?The capacity for music: What is it, and what’s special about it? - ScienceDirectWe examine these issues by looking at the major components of musical organization: rhythm (an interaction of grouping and meter), tonal organization (the structure of melody and harmony), and affect (the interaction of music with emotion). Each domain reveals a combination of cognitively general phenomena, such as gestalt grouping principles, harmonic roughness, and stream segregation, with phenomena that appear special to music and language, such as metrical organization. These are subtly interwoven with a residue of components that are devoted specifically to music, such as the structure of tonal systems and the contours of melodic tension and relaxation that depend on tonality. In the domain of affect, these components are especially tangled, involving the interaction of such varied factors as general-purpose aesthetic framing, communication of affect by tone of voice, and the musically specific way that tonal pitch contours evoke patterns of posture and gesture.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectA variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectVariational analysis of brightness matching.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGives an overview on variational analysis.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectContext-driven judgements as an optimal balance between contrast and dispersion.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGeneralization of the variational framework to perceptual and cognitive phenomena.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectPossibility to derive new constraints for context-driven effects.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectStarting with a computational analysis of brightness matching, we develop a novel variational framework able to model perceptual context-driven effects that may be extended to non-physical judgments as well. The most important feature of the variational framework is the description of these phenomena as a suitable balance between contrast and dispersion. The optimal balance is defined through the simultaneous minimization of functionals characterized by two terms in opposition to each other. When the minimum is reached, the equilibrium between contrast and dispersion is attained. To show the flexibility of the proposed framework, we discuss several examples of such functionals in the field of color perception and cognition which show adherence between theoretical predictions and empirical results. With regard to social cognition theories, the simultaneous occurrence of contrast and dispersion conflicts with sequential models, thus supporting the idea of a concurrent presence of both effects in each judgment. The variational framework can serve as a view from above on perceptual and cognitive phenomena that may help in deriving new constraints for disambiguating alternative theories.The more the better?

A meta-analysis on effects of combined cognitive and physical intervention on cognition in healthy older adults - ScienceDirectBoth cognitive intervention and physical exercise benefit cognitive function in older adults. It has been suggested that combined cognitive and physical intervention may induce larger effects than cognitive or physical intervention alone, but existing literature has shown mixed results. This meta-analysis aimed at assessing the efficacy of combined intervention on cognition by comparing combined intervention to control group, cognitive intervention and physical exercise. Eligible studies were controlled trials examining the effects of combined intervention on cognition in older adults without known cognitive impairment. Twenty interventional studies comprising 2667 participants were included. Results showed that the overall effect size for combined intervention versus control group was 0.29 (random effects model, p = 0.001). Compared to physical exercise, combined intervention produced greater effects on overall effect size (0.22, p < 0.01), while no significant difference was found between combined intervention and cognitive intervention. Effects of combined intervention were moderated by age of participants, intervention frequency and setting. The findings suggest that combined intervention demonstrates advantages over control group and physical exercise, while evidence is still lacking for superiority when compared combined intervention to cognitive intervention. More well-designed studies with long follow-ups are needed to clarify the potential unique efficacy of combined intervention for older adults.Creativity, primordial cognition, and personality - ScienceDirectPotential creativity measured by the Alternate Uses Test, remoteness of word associations, and rated creativity of fantasy stories was found to be related to primordial content in the fantasy stories. Psychoticism and extraversion have been found to be related to creativity. There are theoretical reasons to think that they might also be related to use of primordial cognition. Potential creativity and primordial content were correlated with both extraversion and psychoticism. Potential creativity and primordial cognition were much more strongly related to extraversion than to psychoticism. The common trait binding these traits together may be disinhibition. Relationships among creativity, primordial cognition, and extraversion are much stronger among men than among women.Out of tune: The rise and fall of modernistic music in Brussels, 1919–1939 - ScienceDirectGenre emergence is a collective sense-making process that goes together with the classification of cultural objects. New genres achieve a taken-for-granted status and obtain legitimacy when audiences reach consensus about the labels and attributes that apply to nascent categories. However, the development of shared understandings constitutes a non-trivial task, as often substantial fuzziness and contestation exist about these labels and attributes. Unfortunately, research on new genres often focuses on successful genres—although most proposals to establish new categories do not succeed. To fill this void, studies of nascent genres that fail to become institutionalized are needed. We study modernistic music in Brussels in the inter-war period—a genre that did not become taken-for-granted among a broader audience despite massive means and energy invested by cultural entrepreneurs. We argue that genres characterized by fragmentation—resulting in high category fuzziness or low contrast—lose appeal. Furthermore, we propose that ideological contention resulting from the rise of nationalism exacerbates the effect of genre fragmentation. When sub-genres resonate with different political ideologies, nationalist mobilization is expected to spur contestation about the meaning of the nascent genre—increasing its fuzziness and blocking the development of shared understandings. Our findings support both arguments.Out of tune: The rise and fall of modernistic music in Brussels, 1919–1939 - ScienceDirect► Research on new genres often studies successful genres and overlooks how broader ideological processes shape their rise. ► We argue that genres characterized by fragmentation lose appeal and that ideological contention resulting from the rise of nationalism exacerbates the effect of genre fragmentation. ► We study modernistic music in Brussels in the inter-war period and find support for both arguments.Out of tune: The rise and fall of modernistic music in Brussels, 1919–1939 - ScienceDirectChristophe Boone is a Professor of Organization Theory and Behavior at the Faculty of Applied Economics, University of Antwerp.

However, some individuals – both young and old – encounter difficulties in achieving or maintaining communication proficiency. Biological signals arising from hearing sounds relate to real-life communication skills such as listening to speech in noisy environments and reading, pointing to an intersection between hearing and cognition. Musical experience, amplification, and software-based training can improve these biological signals. These findings of biological plasticity, in a variety of subject populations, relate to attention and auditory memory, and represent an integrated auditory system influenced by both sensation and cognition.Biological impact of music and software-based auditory training - ScienceDirectLearning outcomes: The reader will (1) explain that the auditory system is malleable to experience and training, (2) identify the ingredients necessary for auditory learning to successfully be applied to communication, (3) recognize that the auditory brainstem response to complex sounds (cABR) is a window into the integrated auditory system, and (4) identify examples of how cABR can be used to track the outcome of experience and training.What do monkeys' music choices mean? - ScienceDirectMcDermott and Hauser have recently shown that although monkeys show some types of preferences for sound, preferences for music are found only in humans. This suggests that music might be a relatively recent adaptation in human evolution. Here, I focus on the research methods used by McDermott and Hauser, and consider the findings in relation to infancy research and music psychology.The effects of music exposure and own genre preference on conscious and unconscious cognitive processes: A pilot ERP study - ScienceDirectDid Beethoven and Mozart have more in common with each other than Clapton and Hendrix? The current research demonstrated the widely reported Mozart Effect as only partly significant. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 16 professional classical and rock musicians during a standard 2 stimulus visual oddball task, while listening to classical and rock music. During the oddball task participants were required to discriminate between an infrequent target stimulus randomly embedded in a train of repetitive background or standard stimuli. Consistent with previous research, the P3 and N2 ERPs were elicited in response to the infrequent target stimuli. Own genre preference resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the P3 for classical musicians exposed to classical music and rock musicians exposed to rock music. Notably, at the pre-attentive stage of processing (N2) beneficial effects of exposure to classical music were observed for both groups of musicians. These data are discussed in terms of short and long-term music benefits on both conscious and unconscious cognitive processes.Ready for 21st-century Education – Pre-service Music Teachers Embracing ICT to Foster Student-centered Learning - ScienceDirectThere is always competition for curriculum time for pre-service teachers, especially in teaching methods courses. This study explored whether pre-service teachers are prepared to learn from each other online. It looked at 47 students taking a course entitled “Music Education Methods and Strategies”. Each was required to design a game as a form of pedagogy in music education and to upload it to a learning management system (LMS). They then had to read and comment on all submissions and vote for the best three games. After doing so, the students completed an online survey about their experiences. Thirty-nine valid questionnaires were submitted, giving a response rate of 83%. It is very encouraging to note that the students gave all questions a high rating (scoring them 3 or above on a 5-point Likert-type scale). The two top-rated items confirmed that the students felt responsible for their own learning and competent in using a LMS. This suggests that pre-service music teachers are ready for 21st-century education using information and communications technology to develop learner-centered activities.Ready for 21st-century Education – Pre-service Music Teachers Embracing ICT to Foster Student-centered Learning - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of The 2nd International Conference on Integrated Information.Silent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectIn daily life, responses are often facilitated by anticipatory imagery of expected targets which are announced by associated stimuli from different sensory modalities. Silent music reading represents an intriguing case of visuotonal modality transfer in working memory as it induces highly defined auditory imagery on the basis of presented visuospatial information (i.e. musical notes). Using functional MRI and a delayed sequence matching-to-sample paradigm, we compared brain activations during retention intervals (10 s) of visual (VV) or tonal (TT) unimodal maintenance versus visuospatial-to-tonal modality transfer (VT) tasks. Visual or tonal sequences were comprised of six elements, white squares or tones, which were low, middle, or high regarding vertical screen position or pitch, respectively (presentation duration: 1.5 s). For the cross-modal condition (VT, session 3), the visuospatial elements from condition VV (session 1) were re-defined as low, middle or high “notes” indicating low, middle or high tones from condition TT (session 2), respectively, and subjects had to match tonal sequences (probe) to previously presented note sequences. Tasks alternately had low or high cognitive load. To evaluate possible effects of music reading expertise, 15 singers and 15 non-musicians were included. Scanner task performance was excellent in both groups. Despite identity of applied visuospatial stimuli, visuotonal modality transfer versus visual maintenance (VT > VV) induced “inhibition” of visual brain areas and activation of primary and higher auditory brain areas which exceeded auditory activation elicited by tonal stimulation (VT > TT). This transfer-related visual-to-auditory activation shift occurred in both groups but was more pronounced in experts. Frontoparietal areas were activated by higher cognitive load but not by modality transfer. The auditory brain showed a potential to anticipate expected auditory target stimuli on the basis of non-auditory information and sensory brain activation rather mirrored expectation than stimulation. Silent music reading probably relies on these basic neurocognitive mechanisms.Silent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (149KB)Download full-size imageSilent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectNote: First authorship is shared by C.

We enforced active music therapy (MT) individual session to patients with Rett syndrome. The patients were 4, 5 and 6-year-old. The active music therapy and individual session of 30 min/week were performed. It was recorded in video and description, and using the original evaluation list, six items of fact. On largest problem that is hand operation with purpose in childhood of Rett syndrome, we recorded the longest duration and frequency of hand grasping time in one session. There was the improvement of 35.0% of listening music, 33.3% play music, 13.3% singing music, 11.7% minute motion, 11.7% language, and 20.0% personal relation and sociality. The longest duration of hand grasping time was improved from 2 to 12 s in case 2 and from 7 to 80 s in case 3. Grasp frequency which showed the volition rapidly increased from 3 to 41 times, though the elongation for the duration of grasping was little for case 2. Rett syndrome is the disease in which the psychomotor performance regresses with the age, but the aspect that surely developed in the session could be evaluated. Rett syndrome has the ability understanding the music, and music therapy is suitable for them.Environmental background music and in-store selling - ScienceDirectRetailers use background music in order to enhance the atmosphere of their stores. The present study shows, as predicted by the proposed model, that the effects of music on attitudes toward the store, the salesperson, and the visit to the store are moderated by cognitive processes (number of thoughts and depth of information processing), whereas previous studies focused on emotional moderators. Soothing music (i.e., both pleasant and low arousing) is shown, as predicted, to increase cognitive activity when other cognitive stimulation is low (mainly when sales arguments are weak). However, retailers are warned that enhancing cognitive activity is no panacea since it is found here that higher cognitive activity is associated with lower attitudes. It is proposed that music fit with the store may explain such results. Music fit and cognitive processed triggered by store music are strongly suggested as avenues of store atmospherics research.Alzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectDisclosure: The author has nothing to disclose.Alzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectConflict of Interest: None.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectA framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectExternally and internally directed modes of cognition are thought to compete.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectThey only compete when both involve high levels of intentionality.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectThey can simultaneously co-occur at lower levels of intentionality.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectCompetition arises due to capacity-limited processes supported by the LPFC.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectExternally directed cognition (EDC) involves attending to stimuli in the external environment, whereas internally directed cognition (IDC) involves attending internally to thoughts, memories and mental imagery. To date, most studies have focused on the competition or trade-offs between these modes of cognition. However, both EDC and IDC include a variety of cognitive states that differ along multiple dimensions. These dimensions may influence the way in which EDC and IDC relate to each other. In this review, we present a novel framework that considers whether cognitive resources are oriented externally or internally, and also whether a given cognitive state involves intentional (i.e., voluntary) or spontaneous (i.e., involuntary) processing. Within this framework, we examine the conditions under which EDC and IDC are expected to either compete, or co-occur without interference. We argue that EDC and IDC are not inherently antagonistic, but when both involve higher levels of intentionality they are increasingly likely to compete, due to the capacity limitations of intentional processing. In contrast, if one or both involve spontaneous processing, EDC and IDC can co-occur with minimal interference given that involuntary processes are not subject to the same capacity constraints. A review of the brain regions implicated in EDC and IDC suggests that their neural substrates are partially segregated and partially convergent. Both EDC and IDC recruit the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during intentional processing, and may therefore compete over the processes and representational space it supports. However, at lower levels of intentionality, EDC and IDC rely on largely distinct neural structures, which may enable their co-occurrence without interference. The proposal that EDC and IDC can in some cases co-occur, provides a framework for understanding the complex mental states that underlie theory of mind, creativity, the influence of self-evaluative processing on cognitive control, and memory-guided attention.Metabolic and electric brain patterns during pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by music masterpieces - ScienceDirectBrain correlates comparing pleasant and unpleasant states induced by three dissimilar masterpiece excerpts were obtained. Related emotional reactions to the music were studied using Principal Component Analysis of validated reports, fMRI, and EEG coherent activity. A piano selection by Bach and a symphonic passage from Mahler widely differing in musical features were used as pleasing pieces. A segment by Prodromidès was used as an unpleasing stimulus. Ten consecutive 30 s segments of each piece alternating with random static noise were played to 19 non-musician volunteers for a total of 30 min of auditory stimulation. Both brain approaches identified a left cortical network involved with pleasant feelings (Bach and Mahler vs. Prodromidès) including the left primary auditory area, posterior temporal, inferior parietal and prefrontal regions. While the primary auditory zone may provide an early affective quality, left cognitive areas may contribute to pleasant feelings when melodic sequences follow expected rules. In contrast, unpleasant emotions (Prodromidès vs. Bach and Mahler) involved the activation of the right frontopolar and paralimbic areas. Left activation with pleasant and right with unpleasant musical feelings is consistent with right supremacy in novel situations and left in predictable processes. When all musical excerpts were jointly compared to noise, in addition to bilateral auditory activation, the left temporal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, and frontopolar area were activated suggesting that cognitive and language processes were recruited in general responses to music. Sensory and cognitive integration seems required for musical emotion.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectQuadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectComplex movement previously associated with improved executive function.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectParticipants undertook novel and challenging quadrupedal gait training programme.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectWCST was used to measure executive functions.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectSignificant improvements were observed in cognitive control.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectExercise, and in particular balance and coordination related activities such as dance, appear to have positive effects on cognitive function, as well as neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Quadrupedal gait training is a movement system requiring coordination of all four limbs that has previously been associated with cognitive development in children. There is currently little research into the effect of complex QDP movements on cognitive function in adults.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectTo determine the effects of a novel four-week quadrupedal gait training programme on markers of cognitive function and joint reposition sense in healthy adults.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectTwenty-two physically active sports science students (15 male and 7 female) were divided into two groups: a training group (TG) and a control group (CG). All participants completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and were tested for joint reposition sense before and after a four-week intervention, during which time the TG completed a series of progressive and challenging quadrupedal movement training sessions.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectParticipants in the TG showed significant improvements in the WCST, with improvements in perseverative errors, non-perseverative errors, and conceptual level response. This improvement was not found in the CG. Joint reposition sense also improved for the TG, but only at 20 degrees of shoulder flexion.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectPerformance of a novel, progressive, and challenging task, requiring the coordination of all 4 limbs, has a beneficial impact on cognitive flexibility, and in joint reposition sense, although only at the specific joint angle directly targeted by the training. The findings are consistent with other studies showing improvements in executive function and joint reposition sense following physical activity.Captured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectIn this review article, we summarize the main findings from empirical studies that used dance-related forms of rhythmical full body movement as a research tool for investigating action understanding and social cognition. This work has proven to be informative about behavioral and brain mechanisms that mediate links between perceptual and motor processes invoked during the observation and execution of spatially–temporally coordinated action and interpersonal interaction. The review focuses specifically on processes related to (a) motor experience and expertise, (b) learning and memory, (c) action, intention, and emotion understanding, and (d) audio-visual synchrony and timing. Consideration is given to the relationship between research on dance and more general embodied cognition accounts of action understanding and social cognition. Finally, open questions and issues concerning experimental design are discussed with a view to stimulating future research on social-cognitive aspects of dance.Captured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirect► Review of dance-related research on action understanding and social cognition. ► Focus on perception–action links, brain functions, and cognitive processes. ► Discusses relationships between dance, embodied cognition, and experimental design.Crossmodal effects of Guqin and piano music on selective attention: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectTo compare the effects of music from different cultural environments (Guqin: Chinese music; piano: Western music) on crossmodal selective attention, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data in a standard two-stimulus visual oddball task were recorded from Chinese subjects in three conditions: silence, Guqin music or piano music background. Visual task data were then compared with auditory task data collected previously. In contrast with the results of the auditory task, the early (N1) and late (P300) stages exhibited no differences between Guqin and piano backgrounds during the visual task. Taking our previous study and this study together, we can conclude that: although the cultural-familiar music influenced selective attention both in the early and late stages, these effects appeared only within a sensory modality (auditory) but not in cross-sensory modalities (visual). Thus, the musical cultural factor is more obvious in intramodal than in crossmodal selective attention.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectA music therapy case study is presented with a woman with Alzheimer's disease who participates in improvisation and song writing.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy research in dementia care is examined and links between person centred therapy and music therapy are highlighted.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing is identified as a potent therapeutic technique for working with people with dementia.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy afforded reminiscence, emotional self-expression and the client was able to experience herself in new ways and process what was happening in her life.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectThis paper highlights the role of person-centred music therapy in the care of people with Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia. To begin, it summarizes global dementia statistics and examines the associated symptomatology of the disease. It provides an overview of the research supporting the use of music therapy with people who have dementia and considers the overlap between the person centred care approach and music therapy theory and practice. After identifying the methods most frequently used by music therapists in dementia care, it highlights song writing as a potent music therapy approach in dementia care with older adults. An illustrative case study is presented of a 94-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease who received individual music therapy for 18 months. The case presentation highlights Margaret’s (pseudonym) experience of person-centered music therapy in which song writing was a key component. Writing songs provided opportunities for strengthening and validating identity, for expressing difficult to verbalize emotions, and for reflection on the experience of Alzheimer’s disease.Multidimensional scaling of emotional responses to music in patients with temporal lobe resection - ScienceDirectThe present study investigated emotional responses to music by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis in patients with right or left medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions and matched normal controls (NC). Participants were required to evaluate emotional dissimilarities of nine musical excerpts that were selected to express graduated changes along the valence and arousal dimensions. For this purpose, they rated dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli on an eight-point scale and the resulting matrices were submitted to an MDS analysis. The results showed that patients did not differ from NC participants in evaluating emotional feelings induced by the musical excerpts, suggesting that all participants were able to distinguish refined emotions. We concluded that the ability to detect and use emotional valence and arousal when making dissimilarity judgments was not strongly impaired by a right or left MTL lesion. This finding has important clinical implications and is discussed in light of current neuropsychological studies on emotion. It suggests that emotional responses to music can be at least partially preserved at a non-verbal level in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage including the amygdala.Purchase occasion influence on the role of music in advertising - ScienceDirectThe role of background music in audience responses to commercials (and other marketing elements) has received increasing attention in recent years. This article extends the discussion of music's influence in two ways: (1) by using music theory to analyze and investigate the effects of music's structural profiles on consumers' moods and emotions and (2) by examining the relationship between music's evoked moods that are congruent versus incongruent with the purchase occasion and the resulting effect on purchase intentions. The study reported provides empirical support for the notion that when music is used to evoke emotions congruent with the symbolic meaning of product purchase, the likelihood of purchasing is enhanced.Cognition in the Attention Economy - ScienceDirectCognitive science studies the basic processes of cognition, often mirroring the simple informational environments for which our brain is adapted. Though our brain is adapted for simple environments, we live in an era in which we have access to more information and are surrounded by multiple distractions vying for our attention. This “attention economy” has redefined critical questions in cognitive science. The work of cognitive science must be translated to the current environment. This chapter examines how cognition works or fails to work in an attention economy across a range of phenomena from safety and willpower to the appreciation of art and the ability to think creatively. The costs of a divided cognition and how cognitive science may help us understand what has gone wrong are offered, with a look to the future to examine how the technology underlying an attention economy may help improve cognitive function. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the increasing relevance of cognitive science and a call for cognitive science to study and understand the problems of our distraction-rich world.Effects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectBehavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common problems for patients and caregivers. Although music therapy is considered a non-pharmacological intervention for the management of BPSD, its effectiveness remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of music therapy on BPSD, cognitive function, and activities of daily living in patients with dementia. A literature search was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi. We selected 20 studies, including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, and controlled trials, and conducted a meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD). The results showed that music therapy had moderate effects on anxiety [SMD, −0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), −1.05 – −0.24; p = 0.002] and small effects on behavioral symptoms (SMD, −0.49; 95% CI, −0.82 – −0.17; p = 0.003). In studies of duration >3 months, music therapy had large effects on anxiety (SMD, −0.93; 95% CI, −1.72 – −0.13; p = 0.02). The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that music therapy is effective for the management of BPSD.Effects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirect► This meta-analysis revealed the effect of music therapy for BPSD. ► Music therapy had moderate effects on anxiety and behavioral symptoms. ► Intervention of >3 months duration decreased anxiety more. ► Music therapy will make important contributions to management for decreasing BPSD.Attitude scale development study in relation to music teaching course - ScienceDirectThis study was based on the understanding that learning is a unity consisting of knowledge, education, aspiration and process. The objective of the study was the development of a Music Teaching Course Attitude Scale (MCAS) in order to measure attitudes towards the Music Teaching courses given in Faculties of Education Division of Primary School Education Department of Classroom Teaching Education. The pretesting scale was applied on 170 students studying in Dokuz Eylül University Buca Faculty of Education Division of Primary School Education Department of Classroom Teaching. At the end of the analyses, the lowest and the highest factor coefficients were found as .384 and .848, respectively. Cronbach's Alpha Reliability Coefficient of the 25 item MCAS was 0.96.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectObjectives. To examine: (a) the effect of music type on running time and on sensations and thoughts experienced by the runners under high physical exertion, and (b) the role that music plays in the use of two distinct self-regulation techniques during high exertion, namely dissociative and motivational.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectDesign and procedure. Three studies were conducted. In Study 1 and Study 2, performed in the laboratory, participants ran at 90% of their maximal oxygen uptake on a motorized treadmill four times, once each with rock, dance, and inspirational music, and once without attending to music. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate (HR) were monitored during the run, and discomfort symptoms and music-specific questions were examined. In Study 3, performed in the field, participants ran a hilly course eight times, four under a competitive-pair condition, and four under a single-mode condition. Running time was the dependent variable.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectResults. Music failed to influence HR, RPE, and sensations of exertion in the three studies. However, about 30% of the participants indicated that the music helped them at the beginning of the run. The participants stated that music both directed their attention to the music and motivated them to continue. Despite the heavy workload reported by the runners, running with music was perceived as beneficial by many.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectConclusions: People engaged in high intensity running may benefit from listening to music, but may not increase their ability to sustain that effort longer than they could without music. Further research that incorporates personal music type and rhythm preferences should be carried out in order to advance this line of inquiry.The consumption of music as self-representation in social interaction - ScienceDirectAlthough it is widely accepted that music can be used as a tool to communicate symbolic meaning, there has been little inquiry into how music is consumed to represent the self in social interaction. This paper seeks to provide new insights into the ways in which individuals symbolically consume recorded music. Through the interpretation of phenomenological data gathered from 16 sources, a conceptual framework is developed which depicts the relationship between the consumer’s self-concept, the symbolic properties of music and the consumption situation. The conceptual framework of the consumption of music as self-representation proposes that individuals can use music to represent themselves in social interaction when the meaning of that music is congruent with the image of themselves that they wish to present. This framework clearly illustrates the strength of situational influence and the role of fluid and multiple self-conceptions identities in the symbolic consumption of music.The consumption of music as self-representation in social interaction - ScienceDirectTel.: +64 3 4798160.The consumption of music as self-representation in social interaction - ScienceDirectTel.: +64 3 4795295.Toward a BICA-Model-Based Study of Cognition Using Brain Imaging Techniques - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study is to develop an approach to evaluation of a biologically inspired, causal model of cognition that exposes the mechanistic requirements for achieving fluid intelligence and makes testable predictions of neurophysiological measures. In order to build human-level-efficient tools for data analysis, it is necessary to have a theory of how concepts are represented in the human brain. This theory should specify (a) the structure and semantics of concept representations in the human brain, and (b) types, formats and specific patterns of neuronal activity instantiating these representations. The key to a biologically-informed human brain model begins with the mapping of (a) to (b), i.e., of the emotional Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (eBICA) to informative features and characteristics of brain activity. The result is a detailed description of the information processing level of the dynamics of emotional evaluation of other agents and relationships with them in the process of joint activities, and the role of this evaluation in decision-making and generation of behavior based on the selected emotional cognitive architecture.Toward a BICA-Model-Based Study of Cognition Using Brain Imaging Techniques - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2015.The emotional power of music: How music enhances the feeling of affective pictures - ScienceDirectMusic is an intriguing stimulus widely used in movies to increase the emotional experience. However, no brain imaging study has to date examined this enhancement effect using emotional pictures (the modality mostly used in emotion research) and musical excerpts. Therefore, we designed this functional magnetic resonance imaging study to explore how musical stimuli enhance the feeling of affective pictures. In a classical block design carefully controlling for habituation and order effects, we presented fearful and sad pictures (mostly taken from the IAPS) either alone or combined with congruent emotional musical excerpts (classical pieces). Subjective ratings clearly indicated that the emotional experience was markedly increased in the combined relative to the picture condition. Furthermore, using a second-level analysis and regions of interest approach, we observed a clear functional and structural dissociation between the combined and the picture condition. Besides increased activation in brain areas known to be involved in auditory as well as in neutral and emotional visual–auditory integration processes, the combined condition showed increased activation in many structures known to be involved in emotion processing (including for example amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, insula, striatum, medial ventral frontal cortex, cerebellum, fusiform gyrus). In contrast, the picture condition only showed an activation increase in the cognitive part of the prefrontal cortex, mainly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Based on these findings, we suggest that emotional pictures evoke a more cognitive mode of emotion perception, whereas congruent presentations of emotional visual and musical stimuli rather automatically evoke strong emotional feelings and experiences.The effects of Need for Cognition on Internet use revisited - ScienceDirectThe Internet is the biggest information carrier of our times. However, there is little understanding of the interaction between the different behaviors of the various Internet users, and the variety of ways in which information in the Internet should be presented. This work continues previous research [Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Kaynar, O., & Fine, A. (2005). The effects of need for cognition on Internet use. Unpublished manuscript.] that examined the preferences of participants with varying level of Need for Cognition (NFC) [Cacioppo, J. T., & Petty, R. E. (1982). The need for cognition. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, 116–131.] in internet sites varying in their interactivity. This article seeks to broaden the understanding of the behavior of people varying in NFC outside of research situations. We hypothesized that people high in NFC will use information services in the Internet relatively more than those with a low NFC. Furthermore, we hypothesized that people with a high NFC will perceive the informational characteristics of a website as the most important in the creation of a successful and convincing Internet site. Fifty experienced Web surfers filled out an Internet uses questionnaire in which they stated the amount of time they spend per week in 30 different Internet services. This data was later submitted to a Factor Analysis which revealed three major uses: professional, social and leisure. The participants filled out also a preferences questionnaire in which they stated their perceived importance of different characteristics in the creation of a successful and persuasive Internet site. Results support our hypothesis regarding the correlation between NFC and professional services use, and the perceived importance of information in creating a persuasive site. Several other findings are also discussed.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectThe effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectProcessing speed and attention improved after a 3-month aerobic exercise training.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectImprovement in verbal learning occurred regardless of the type of exercise training.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectStretching exercise showed some modest improvements in cognition at follow-up.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectAerobic exercise (AE) has been shown to improve cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether these exercise-induced cognitive benefits persist beyond the training period. Accordingly, the present study sought to examine the immediate and maintenance effects of AE on a wide range of cognitive functions in 75 schizophrenia patients randomized to 12 weeks of either moderate-intensity treadmill exercise or stretching and toning exercise that served as a control. Participants completed assessments of neurocognition and cardiovascular fitness at pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. The results showed that the AE group outperformed the controls on processing speed and attention at the end of intervention. The two groups did not differ significantly in any cognitive outcome measured at follow-up; however, improvement over time was noted in certain cognitive domains in AE group. The average effect sizes at follow-up were 0.53 and 0.35 for AE and control groups, respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in aerobic fitness at posttest and follow-up, and that fitness level was not related to changes in cognitive performance. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a trend towards beneficial effects of physical activity on cognition over a short follow-up period in favor of AE.Musical emotions, cognitive science, and art of music - ScienceDirectVarious proposals and criticisms are addressed. Particular attention is given to future developments, both theoretical and experimental.Effects of the Big Five and musical genre on music-induced movement - ScienceDirectNine-hundred-and-fifty-two individuals completed the Big Five Inventory, and 60 extreme scorers were presented with 30 music excerpts from six popular genres. Music-induced movement was recorded by an optical motion-capture system, the data from which 55 postural, kinematic, and kinetic movement features were computed. These features were subsequently reduced to five principal components of movement representing Local Movement, Global Movement, Hand Flux, Head Speed, and Hand Distance. Multivariate Analyses revealed significant effects on these components of both personality and genre, as well as several interactions between the two. Each personality dimension was associated with a different pattern of movement characteristics, with Extraversion and Neuroticism eliciting the clearest relationships. Latin, Techno, and Rock music, meanwhile, most clearly elicited different movement characteristics.Did the frequency of early elementary classroom arts instruction decrease during the no child left behind era? If so, for whom? - ScienceDirectDid the frequency of early elementary classroom arts instruction decrease during the no child left behind era?

If so, for whom? - ScienceDirectAnalyzing teacher reports from two cohorts of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, this study looked at changes in the frequency of early elementary classroom arts instruction from the 1999–2000 to the 2011–12 school year. The majority of classroom teachers surveyed in our study reported on first-grade students (94%–96%). We found that the percentage of children spending no classroom time on arts activities significantly increased for music, visual art, dance, and theater. This decreased participation in classroom arts activities was generally largest for students in the bottom one-third of the social class distribution. Overall, participation in at least some music or visual arts activities continued above 95%. However, participation in at least some dance fell to about 46% and participation in at least some theater to about 40% (compared to 58% and 56% reported in the 1999–2000 school year). In contrast, for music, dance, and theater, among students receiving at least some exposure during regular class time, the amount of time spent on these activities each week significantly increased. This finding was most robust for music; those students who already had at least some participation experienced a 20-min increase in the amount of classroom time spent on music activities. During the No Child Left Behind era many early elementary educators completely eliminated dance and theater activities from their classrooms. However, those teachers who did not completely eliminate music, dance, or theater activities actually increased the time devoted to them. This heterogeneity in teachers’ responses to policy changes must be accounted for in future attempts to project the likely consequences of alternative educational policies.Effects of Aural-imitative and Aural-motivic Analyses on Higher-order Thinking Skill and Creative Musical Product in Music Improvisation - ScienceDirectThis study aims to investigate the effects of two teaching strategies, aural-imitative and aural-motivic analyses on higher-order thinking skill (HOT) and creative musical product (CMP) in music improvisation. The study employed a pretest-posttest with between-subjects experimental design to compare the effects of two teaching strategies (treatments). The participants consisted of 65 piano students (10 to 16 years old). Two instruments, the Higher-Order Thinking Skill Test and the Creative Musical Product Test were used to collect data from the subjects before and after the treatments. Results of the SPANOVA test show that the aural-motivic analysis teaching strategy significantly improved HOT and CMP of the participants.Effects of Aural-imitative and Aural-motivic Analyses on Higher-order Thinking Skill and Creative Musical Product in Music Improvisation - ScienceDirectSelection and/or peer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Historical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectOver the past twenty years, historical perspectives in music sociology have linked music to a wide range of social processes. These include the material culture of performance and reception, distribution organisation, critical discourse and music education, the social shaping of musical style, the politics of taste and patronage, and the changing nature of the musical audience, music reception, reputation, authenticity, innovation. This work has partially overlapped with ‘new musicology’ and its deconstruction of the idea of aesthetic autonomy. More recently, new topics have been drawn into the frame including: music as a medium of political action, music’s role in relation to the history of science and the body, and music as a technology of identity and memory. In all of these areas, music’s presence is highlighted as a resource for social ordering, in particular as an agent of psycho-cultural change.Historical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectTia DeNora teaches sociology at Exeter University (UK).

This deficit leads to impaired social cognition and interactions. In this study, we investigated whether impaired processing of emotions also affects musical stimuli, which are widely present in daily life and known for their emotional impact. Thirty schizophrenic patients and 30 matched healthy controls evaluated the emotional content of musical, vocal and facial stimuli. Schizophrenic patients are less accurate than healthy controls in recognizing emotion in music, voices and faces. Our results confirm impaired recognition of emotion in voice and face stimuli in schizophrenic patients and extend this observation to the recognition of emotion in musical stimuli.Panax ginseng for Psychomotor Performance and Cognition, Spinal Manipulation for Lumbar Disk Herniation, Ginger for Migraines, Music Therapy for Mental Illness, and Acupuncture for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy - ScienceDirectRichard Glickman-Simon, MD, is a family physician, integrative medicine editor of DynaMed, and assistant professor of public health and family medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, MA, and a contributor to DynaMed in Ipswich, Massachusetts.Panax ginseng for Psychomotor Performance and Cognition, Spinal Manipulation for Lumbar Disk Herniation, Ginger for Migraines, Music Therapy for Mental Illness, and Acupuncture for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy - ScienceDirectLeigh Tenkku Lepper, PhD, MPH, is an Associate Research Professor and Director for Research for the School of Social Work at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.Panax ginseng for Psychomotor Performance and Cognition, Spinal Manipulation for Lumbar Disk Herniation, Ginger for Migraines, Music Therapy for Mental Illness, and Acupuncture for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy - ScienceDirectDynaMed is an evidence-based clinical reference, which is updated daily through systematic surveillance and critical appraisal of the research literature.

I review recent results in neuroscience and cognitive biology that, when combined, provide key components of such an improved conceptual framework for contemporary cognitive science. Starting at the neuronal level, I first discuss the contemporary realization that single neurons are powerful tree-shaped computers, which implies a reorientation of computational models of learning and plasticity to a lower, cellular, level. I then turn to predictive systems theory (predictive coding and prediction-based learning) which provides a powerful formal framework for understanding brain function at a more global level. Although most formal models concerning predictive coding are framed in associationist terms, I argue that modern data necessitate a reinterpretation of such models in cognitive terms: as model-based predictive systems. Finally, I review the role of the theory of computation and formal language theory in the recent explosion of comparative biological research attempting to isolate and explore how different species differ in their cognitive capacities. Experiments to date strongly suggest that there is an important difference between humans and most other species, best characterized cognitively as a propensity by our species to infer tree structures from sequential data. Computationally, this capacity entails generative capacities above the regular (finite-state) level; implementationally, it requires some neural equivalent of a push-down stack. I dub this unusual human propensity “dendrophilia”, and make a number of concrete suggestions about how such a system may be implemented in the human brain, about how and why it evolved, and what this implies for models of language acquisition. I conclude that, although much remains to be done, a neurally-grounded framework for theoretical cognitive science is within reach that can move beyond polarized debates and provide a more adequate theoretical future for cognitive biology.Music and metronome cues produce different effects on gait spatiotemporal measures but not gait variability in healthy older adults - ScienceDirectRhythmic auditory cues including music and metronome beats have been used, sometimes interchangeably, to improve disordered gait arising from a range of clinical conditions. There has been limited investigation into whether there are optimal cue types. Different cue types have produced inconsistent effects across groups which differed in both age and clinical condition. The possible effect of normal ageing on response to different cue types has not been reported for gait. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of both rhythmic music and metronome cues on gait spatiotemporal measures (including variability) in healthy older people. Twelve women and seven men (>65 years) walked on an instrumented walkway at comfortable pace and then in time to each of rhythmic music and metronome cues at comfortable pace stepping frequency. Music but not metronome cues produced a significant increase in group mean gait velocity of 4.6 cm/s, due mostly to a significant increase in group mean stride length of 3.1 cm. Both cue types produced a significant but small increase in cadence of 1 step/min. Mean spatio-temporal variability was low at baseline and did not increase with either cue type suggesting cues did not disrupt gait timing. Study findings suggest music and metronome cues may not be used interchangeably and cue type as well as frequency should be considered when evaluating effects of rhythmic auditory cueing on gait. Further work is required to determine whether optimal cue types and frequencies to improve walking in different clinical groups can be identified.Music and metronome cues produce different effects on gait spatiotemporal measures but not gait variability in healthy older adults - ScienceDirect► The effect on gait of two different rhythmic auditory cues was studied in healthy older people. ► Compared to baseline, gait speed increased with rhythmic music but not metronome cues. ► Increased speed with music cues was due mostly to increased stride length. ► Spatio-temporal variability was low at baseline and did not increase with either cue. ► Different types of rhythmic auditory cue for gait may not be interchangeable.Kant’s transcendental and empirical psychology of cognition - ScienceDirectOne of the perennially intriguing questions regarding Kant’s approach to the human sciences is the relation between his ‘transcendental psychology’ and empirical cognitive psychology. In this paper I compare his analysis of the a priori conditions of human cognition in the Critique of pure reason with his empirical account of the human cognitive faculties in his Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view. In comparing his approach to self-consciousness, sensibility, imagination, and understanding in these two works, I argue that Kant distinguishes between the transcendental and empirical aspects of the human cognitive faculties, and regards the transcendental functions as configuring the empirical faculties of human consciousness, or as giving them the structure that they require to become faculties of cognition. I then show that the cognitive faculties of human beings may vary in their empirical operation, even while they are configured by the same transcendental structure. Finally, I characterize Kant’s transcendental psychology in the first Critique as an account of the faculties that are required for a mind to be an agent or subject of cognition, corresponding to his account of the conditions that are required universally and necessarily for something to be an object of cognition.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectToward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectWe used both classical and Iranian musical excerpts.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectWe recorded EEG signals while participants listened to musical selections.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectWe defined features based on the theory effective connectivity.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectWe examined the correlation of the extracted features with valence and arousal.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectWe classified signals into different categories using connectivity-based features.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effective brain networks associated with joyful, melancholic, and neutral music. Connectivity patterns among EEG electrodes in different frequency bands were extracted by multivariate autoregressive modeling while 19 nonmusicians listened to selected classical and Iranian musical excerpts. Musical selections were categorized according to the participants' average self-assessment results. Connectivity matrices were analyzed to identify distinct variations in the connectivity indices related to the categorized excerpts. We studied the correlation of inter-/intra-regional connectivity patterns with the self-reported evaluations of the musical selections. The perceived valence was positively correlated with the frontal inter-hemispheric flow, but negatively correlated with the parietal bilateral connectivity. Using the connectivity indices between different cortical areas and a support vector machine, we sought to distinguish trials in terms of the self-reported valence of perceived emotions and the familiarity of the musical genres. For 16 participants, the average classification accuracies in discriminating joyful from neutral, joyful from melancholic and familiar from unfamiliar trials were 93.7% ± 1.06%, 80.43% ± 1.74%, and 83.04% ± 1.47, respectively. Integration of different cortical areas is required for music perception and emotional processing. Thus, by studying the connectivity of brain regions, we may be able to develop a noninvasive assessment tool for investigating musical emotions.Toward automatic detection of brain responses to emotional music through analysis of EEG effective connectivity - ScienceDirectPresent address: Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Re-scaling emotional approaches to music: Basque band Lisabö and the soundscapes of urban alienation - ScienceDirectBuilding on recent studies that have linked music, emotion and geography, this article looks at the musical production of the Basque post-punk band ‘Lisabö’ across its four albums: Ezlekuak (Bidehuts, 2007), Izkiriaturik aurkitu ditudan gurak (Metak, 2005), Ezarian (Esan Ozenki, 2000) and the EP Egan Bat Nonahi (Acuarela, 2002). Melding musical (cultural/textual) studies with a range of geographical and urban theory, this analysis takes on both the sonic immediacy and the lyrical content of the band’s music in an attempt to re-scale emotional approaches to space and place to an urban level. Ultimately, this reading of Lisabö’s emotional soundscapes highlights the role (and omission) of emotion in the production of urban places and simultaneously suggests that our emotional connections with music might form the basis for an embodied musical criticism engaged with space and place at the level of the urban.Re-scaling emotional approaches to music: Basque band Lisabö and the soundscapes of urban alienation - ScienceDirectThe author is a member of both the Association of American Geographers and the Modern Language Association.Perception of Professional Identity Among the Violin Teachers of Estonian Music Schools - ScienceDirectA survey was conducted among 58 violins teachers (43% of the total population) in Estonia to study teachers’ perceptions of professional identity. Professional identity perceptions and self-reported teaching activities were collected with a questionnaire developed by Beijaard, Verloop&Vermunt (2000). It appeared that i) during their career, teacherś perceptions of their professional identity shifted from subject-centred focus towards a focus on students’ general development; ii) self-perception of identity was not often related to self-reported teaching activities; iii) there are differences between professional identity perceptions in relation to teachers’ pedagogical rank.Perception of Professional Identity Among the Violin Teachers of Estonian Music Schools - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of WCES 2014.Physiological stress response to video-game playing: the contribution of built-in music - ScienceDirectRecent studies on video game playing have uncovered a wide range of measurable physiological effects on the organism, such as increases in cardiovascular activity and breathing responses. However, the exact source of these effects remains unclear. Given the well-known effects of sound on physiological activity, especially those of noise and of music, and on the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol in particular, we hypothesized that music may be a major source of stress during video game playing. We thus examined the effect of built-in music on cortisol secretion as a consequence of video game playing. Players were assigned quasi-randomly to either a Music or a Silence condition. Four saliva samples were taken, that is, after practice (T1), immediately after having played for 10 minutes (T2), 15 minutes after the end of the experiment (T3), and 30 minutes after the end of the experiment (T4). The results show that the Music group had significantly higher cortisol levels at T3, that is, when cortisol levels are assumed to reflect the stress induced by the game. These findings suggest for the first time that the auditory input contributes significantly to the stress response found during video game playing.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectReplication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectAdvanced and novice performance examined in conservatoire instrumentalists.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectA/T and SMR neurofeedback were compared with prepared and improvised pieces.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectA/T enhanced creativity/musicality, technique and communication.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectSMR improved technique and communication only in novice performance.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectNeurofeedback learning/performance outcome correlations support causation.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectAlpha/theta (A/T) and sensory-motor rhythm (SMR) neurofeedback were compared in university instrumentalists who were novice singers with regard to prepared and improvised instrumental and vocal performance in three music domains: creativity/musicality, technique and communication/presentation. Only A/T training enhanced advanced playing seen in all three domains by expert assessors and validated by correlations with learning indices, strongest with Creativity/Musicality as shown by Egner and Gruzelier (2003). Here A/T gains extended to novice performance – prepared vocal, improvised vocal and instrumental – and were recognised by a lay audience who judged the prepared folk songs. SMR learning correlated positively with Technical Competence and Communication in novice performance, in keeping with SMR neurofeedback's known impact on lower-order processes such as attention, working memory and psychomotor skills. The importance of validation through learning indices was emphasised in the interpretation of neurofeedback outcome.Towards a neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectMusic perception involves complex brain functions underlying acoustic analysis, auditory memory, auditory scene analysis, and processing of musical syntax and semantics. Moreover, music perception potentially affects emotion, influences the autonomic nervous system, the hormonal and immune systems, and activates (pre)motor representations. During the past few years, research activities on different aspects of music processing and their neural correlates have rapidly progressed. This article provides an overview of recent developments and a framework for the perceptual side of music processing. This framework lays out a model of the cognitive modules involved in music perception, and incorporates information about the time course of activity of some of these modules, as well as research findings about where in the brain these modules might be located.Cues for self-recognition in point-light displays of actions performed in synchrony with music - ScienceDirectSelf–other discrimination was investigated with point-light displays in which actions were presented with or without additional auditory information. Participants first executed different actions (dancing, walking and clapping) in time with music. In two subsequent experiments, they watched point-light displays of their own or another participant’s recorded actions, and were asked to identify the agent (self vs. other). Manipulations were applied to the visual information (actions differing in complexity, and degradation from 15 to 2 point-lights within the same clapping action) and to the auditory information (self-generated vs. externally-generated vs. none). Results indicate that self-recognition was better than chance in all conditions and was highest when observing relatively unconstrained patterns of movement. Auditory information did not increase accuracy even with the most ambiguous visual displays, suggesting that judgments of agent identity depend much more on motor cues than on auditory (action-generated) or audiovisual (synchronization) information.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectSelf-recognition by musical sounds is a fertile domain for investigating agency.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectAgency relies on action simulation based on perception–action links.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectCue integration is a key process in agency attribution in musical contexts.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectMusic research on agency has implications for theories of embodied cognition.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectImplications for research designs and applied musical practice are discussed.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectThis review article provides a summary of the findings from empirical studies that investigated recognition of an action's agent by using music and/or other auditory information. Embodied cognition accounts ground higher cognitive functions in lower level sensorimotor functioning. Action simulation, the recruitment of an observer's motor system and its neural substrates when observing actions, has been proposed to be particularly potent for actions that are self-produced. This review examines evidence for such claims from the music domain. It covers studies in which trained or untrained individuals generated and/or perceived (musical) sounds, and were subsequently asked to identify who was the author of the sounds (e.g., the self or another individual) in immediate (online) or delayed (offline) research designs. The review is structured according to the complexity of auditory–motor information available and includes sections on: 1) simple auditory information (e.g., clapping, piano, drum sounds), 2) complex instrumental sound sequences (e.g., piano/organ performances), and 3) musical information embedded within audiovisual performance contexts, when action sequences are both viewed as movements and/or listened to in synchrony with sounds (e.g., conductors' gestures, dance). This work has proven to be informative in unraveling the links between perceptual–motor processes, supporting embodied accounts of human cognition that address action observation. The reported findings are examined in relation to cues that contribute to agency judgments, and their implications for research concerning action understanding and applied musical practice.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectRhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectNeural entrainment to rhythmic stimuli is largely automatic but can be modulated.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectPotential confound between rhythmic evoked responses and entrained oscillations.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectFor hierarchically structured stimuli, entrainment to a basic organizing rhythm.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectLink between temporal processing involved in speech and music perception.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectHere we review the role of brain oscillations in sensory processing. We examine the idea that neural entrainment of intrinsic oscillations underlies the processing of rhythmic stimuli in the context of simple isochronous rhythms as well as in music and speech. This has been a topic of growing interest over recent years; however, many issues remain highly controversial: how do fluctuations of intrinsic neural oscillations—both spontaneous and entrained to external stimuli—affect perception, and does this occur automatically or can it be actively controlled by top-down factors? Some of the controversy in the literature stems from confounding use of terminology. Moreover, it is not straightforward how theories and findings regarding isochronous rhythms generalize to more complex, naturalistic stimuli, such as speech and music. Here we aim to clarify terminology, and distinguish between different phenomena that are often lumped together as reflecting “neural entrainment” but may actually vary in their mechanistic underpinnings. Furthermore, we discuss specific caveats and confounds related to making inferences about oscillatory mechanisms from human electrophysiological data.From domain-generality to domain-sensitivity: 4-Month-olds learn an abstract repetition rule in music that 7-month-olds do not - ScienceDirectLearning must be constrained for it to lead to productive generalizations. Although biology is undoubtedly an important source of constraints, prior experience may be another, leading learners to represent input in ways that are more conducive to some generalizations than others, and/or to up- and down-weight features when entertaining generalizations. In two experiments, 4-month-old and 7-month-old infants were familiarized with sequences of musical chords or tones adhering either to an AAB pattern or an ABA pattern. In both cases, the 4-month-olds learned the generalization, but the 7-month-olds did not. The success of the 4-month-olds appears to contradict an account that this type of pattern learning is the provenance of a language-specific rule-learning module. It is not yet clear what drives the age-related change, but plausible candidates include differential experience with language and music, as well as interactions between general cognitive development and stimulus complexity.The nature of music from a biological perspective - ScienceDirectMusic, as language, is a universal human trait. Throughout human history and across all cultures, people have produced and enjoyed music. Despite its ubiquity, the musical capacity is rarely studied as a biological function. Music is typically viewed as a cultural invention. In this paper, the evidence bearing on the biological perspective of the musical capacity is reviewed. Related issues, such as domain-specificity, innateness, and brain localization, are addressed in an attempt to offer a unified conceptual basis for the study of music processing. This scheme should facilitate the study of the biological foundations of music by bringing together the fields of genetics, developmental and comparative research, neurosciences, and musicology.Music listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectThe principal aim of this study was to determine if different profiles (types) of emotional reactions following music listening (happiness and sadness) characterized different levels of emotional well-being (i.e., positive and negative affects) in adolescence. The secondary aim was to examine relationships between social congruence in music tastes with friends or parents (i.e., sharing similar music tastes and having fewer conflicts about music) and emotional well-being in adolescence. This study's sample was composed of 316 adolescents (M = 15.32 and S.D. = 0.90 years of age; 172 girls and 144 boys). Cluster analysis identified three profiles: (1) ‘emotionally-negative listeners’ (medium happiness and higher sadness); (2) ‘emotionally-limited listeners’ (lower happiness and lower sadness); (3) ‘emotionally-positive listeners’ (higher happiness and lower sadness). Results indicated that ‘emotionally-negative listeners’ had less emotional well-being, that ‘emotionally-positive listeners’ had more emotional well-being, and that social congruence in music tastes with both friends and parents were related to more emotional well-being.Music listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectL’objectif primaire de cette étude était de déterminer si différents profils (types) de réactions émotionnelles suite à l’écoute de la musique (bonheur et tristesse) caractérisent différents niveaux de bien-être émotionnel (i.e., affects positifs et négatifs) à l’adolescence. L’objectif secondaire était d’examiner les relations entre la congruence sociale des goûts musicaux avec les amis ou les parents (i.e., partager des goûts musicaux similaires et avoir moins de conflits à propos de la musique) et le bien-être émotionnel à l’adolescence. L’échantillon de cette étude était composé de 316 adolescents (M = 15.32 et ET = 0,90 ans ; 172 filles et 144 garçons). Une analyse par regroupements (cluster analysis) a identifié trois profils : (1) « auditeurs émotionnellement négatifs » (bonheur moyen et tristesse élevée) ; (2) « auditeurs émotionnellement limités » (bonheur faible et tristesse faible) ; (3) « auditeurs émotionnellement positifs » (bonheur élevé et tristesse faible). Les résultats ont indiqué que les « auditeurs émotionnellement négatifs » avaient moins de bien-être émotionnel, que les « auditeurs émotionnellement positifs » avaient plus de bien-être émotionnel et que la congruence sociale des goûts musicaux avec les amis et les parents était associée à plus de bien-être émotionnel.Effects of Music Therapy on Self- and Experienced Stigma in Patients on an Acute Care Psychiatric Unit: A Randomized Three Group Effectiveness Study - ScienceDirectStigma is a major social barrier that can restrict access to and willingness to seek psychiatric care. Psychiatric consumers may use secrecy and withdrawal in an attempt to cope with stigma. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of music therapy on self- and experienced stigma in acute care psychiatric inpatients using a randomized design with wait-list control. Participants (N = 83) were randomly assigned by cluster to one of three single-session group-based conditions: music therapy, education, or wait-list control. Participants in the music therapy and education conditions completed only posttests while participants in the wait-list control condition completed only pretests. The music therapy condition was a group songwriting intervention wherein participants composed lyrics for “the stigma blues.” Results indicated significant differences in measures of discrimination (experienced stigma), disclosure (self-stigma), and total stigma between participants in the music therapy condition and participants in the wait-list control condition. From the results of this randomized controlled investigation, music therapy may be an engaging and effective psychosocial technique to treat stigma. Limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for clinical practice and psychiatric music therapy research are provided.Extended cognition and the space of social interaction - ScienceDirectThe extended mind thesis (EM) asserts that some cognitive processes are (partially) composed of actions consisting of the manipulation and exploitation of environmental structures. Might some processes at the root of social cognition have a similarly extended structure? In this paper, I argue that social cognition is fundamentally an interactive form of space management—the negotiation and management of “we-space”—and that some of the expressive actions involved in the negotiation and management of we-space (gesture, touch, facial and whole-body expressions) drive basic processes of interpersonal understanding and thus do genuine social-cognitive work. Social interaction is a kind of extended social cognition, driven and at least partially constituted by environmental (non-neural) scaffolding. Challenging the Theory of Mind paradigm, I draw upon research from gesture studies, developmental psychology, and work on Moebius Syndrome to support this thesis.How does ‘cognition’ matter to the analysis of talk-in-interaction? - ScienceDirectConversation Analysis (CA) and Discursive Psychology (DP) reject the view that assumptions about cognitive processes should be used to account for discursive phenomena. Instead, cognitive issues are respecified as discursive phenomena. Discursive psychologists do this by studying discursive practices of talking about mental phenomena and using mental predicates. This approach is exemplified by a study of the use of constructions with German verstehen (‘to understand’) in conversation. Some conversation analysts take another approach, namely, inquiring into how participants display mental states in talk-in-interaction. This is exemplified by a study of how grammatical constructions are used to display different types of inferences drawn from a partner’s prior turn. It will be argued that the constructivist, anti-essentialist stance which CA and DP take with regard to cognition is a prosperous line of research, which has much in its favor from a methodological point of view. However, it can be shown that tacit assumptions about cognitive processes are still inevitable when doing CA and DP. As a conclusion, the paper pleads for an enhanced awareness of how cognitive processes come into play when analysing talk-in-interaction and it advocates the integration of a more explicit cognitive perspective into research on talk-in-interaction.How does ‘cognition’ matter to the analysis of talk-in-interaction? - ScienceDirect► Reviews how conversation analysis and discursive psychology conceive of cognitive phenomena in interaction. ► Discusses anti-mentalism with reference to displaying understanding in talk-in-interaction. ► Shows how cognitive ascriptions come into play when analyzing interactional practices. ► Argues that assumptions about cognition are inevitable for doing conversation analysis. ► Argues that a more explicit cognitive perspective is needed within the methodological framework of conversation analysis.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectObjectives: To examine the effects of self-selected asynchronous (background) music on flow and netball shooting performance in three netball players. Based on the research of Karageorghis and Terry (1999) it was hypothesized that music would promote flow and would therefore have a positive impact on netball shooting performance.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectDesign: An idiographic single-subject multiple baselines across-subjects design was employed (Wollman, 1986). The rationale centred upon the work of Patrick and Hrycaiko (1998) who indicated that single-subject designs were the most appropriate methodology for applied research.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectMethods: The participants comprised three collegiate netball players who were asked to complete 11 performance trials. Each trial involved taking 12 shots from lines located at three shooting positions. After each performance trial, flow and the internal experience of each player were assessed using the Flow State Scale (Jackson & Marsh, 1996) and Practical Assessment Questionnaire. Participants received the intervention of asynchronous music with the length of pre-intervention baseline increasing for each succeeding player.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectResults: Two of the participants experienced an increase in the perception of flow while all three participants improved their netball shooting performance. In addition, participants indicated that the intervention helped them to control both the emotions and cognitions that impacted upon their performance.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectConclusions: Interventions comprising self-selected music and imagery can enhance athletic performance by triggering emotions and cognitions associated with flow.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectTo study the effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture daily in a clinical setting.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAcupuncture Unit at Shenzhen Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shenzhen City of China.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectSixty children with cerebral palsy undergoing acupuncture.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectIntervention: Children listened to their favorite music or a blank disc for 30 min. Measurements: (1) the modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale for children's anxiety (mYPAS); (2) children's hospital of eastern Ontario pain scale (CHEOPS) and Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale (FACES) for pain intensity; (3) vital signs including mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR).Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAn independent sample t-test showed significantly lower mYPAS scores in the music group 30 min after the intervention compared with the control group (t = 4.72, P = 0.00). Significant differences between groups were found in mYPAS scores (F = 4.270, d.f. = 1, P = 0.043, Partial η2 = 0.069) and over treatment duration (F = 143.421, d.f. = 1.521, P = 0.000, Partial η2 = 0.712). A significant interaction was also found (F = 4.298, d.f. = 1.521, P = 0.025, Partial η2 = 0.069). LSD's post hoc testing confirmed that the mYPAS scores significantly increased from the baseline to 1 min (P = 0.000, 95% CI 14.913, 20.257) and then gradually decreased from 1 to 30 min (P = 0.000, 95% CI −18.952, −13.714). For pain intensity scores, a highly significant time effect was found in both the CHEOPS (F = 87.347, d.f. = 2, P = 0.000, Partial η2 = 0.601) and FACES (F = 225.871, d.f. = 1.822, P = 0.000, Partial η2 = 0.796), and a significant interaction effect was found as well (F = 4.369, d.f. = 2, P = 0.015, Partial η2 = 0.070; F = 5.859, d.f. = 1.822, P = 0.005, Partial η2 = 0.092). However, no significant difference between groups was present (F = 2.343, d.f. = 1, P = 0.131, Partial η2 = 0.039; F = 3.738, d.f. = 1, P = 0.058, Partial η2 = 0.061). Significant differences between groups were found in MAP and HR (P < 0.05) and over time (P < 0.05), but no significant effects in RR were apparent (P > 0.05). A significant interaction effect was found in HR (P < 0.05), but not in MAP or RR (P > 0.05).Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectThis study demonstrates that listening to music while receiving acupuncture can relieve anxiety among children with cerebral palsy; however, no effect was observed in terms of pain reduction. Further research is needed to explore the types of music which best impact an individual's treatment. Whether music results in fewer accidents and side effects of acupuncture should be investigated. Music can be considered as adjunctive therapy in clinical situations that may be anxiety-provoking for children.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectIn this paper, a novel probabilistic model of harmonic progressions and a generation scheme based on such model are presented. On the basis of the large amount of publications that show the stochastic nature of the music and the possibility of modelling it by means of statistical processes, this paper shows how to create a non-homogeneous Markov chain to automatically generate harmonic progressions by building a temporal reference of the internal beat structure of music to guide the progressions. Thus, this new model develops on the classic transition matrix to include a beat-dependent / temporal layer to model the residency time.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectThe method for the automatic creation of harmonic progressions based on the model developed is presented after the model. The harmonic progressions generated by our scheme are coherent with the style of the training data employed and, thanks to the specific temporal layer designed, the musical mid-term and long-term dependencies that lead to a natural and logic cadence are taken into account. The model developed is usable for the automatic generation of harmonic patterns that can be used to enlarge the flexibility and creativity of pattern-based computational music composers.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectMusical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe identify neural markers for musical expertise using single-trial analysis of the EEG.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe show that experts and novices have different spatio-temporal neural signatures of anomaly detection.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe find evidence for an auditory–motor coupling in musical experts when detecting anomalies.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe provide evidence for the embodied cognition hypothesis.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectHumans are extremely good at detecting anomalies in sensory input. For example, while listening to a piece of Western-style music, an anomalous key change or an out-of-key pitch is readily apparent, even to the non-musician. In this paper we investigate differences between musical experts and non-experts during musical anomaly detection. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalograms (EEG) of five expert cello players and five non-musicians while they listened to excerpts of J.S. Bach’s Prelude from Cello Suite No. 1. All subjects were familiar with the piece, though experts also had extensive experience playing the piece. Subjects were told that anomalous musical events (AMEs) could occur at random within the excerpts of the piece and were told to report the number of AMEs after each excerpt. Furthermore, subjects were instructed to remain still while listening to the excerpts and their lack of movement was verified via visual and EEG monitoring. Experts had significantly better behavioral performance (i.e. correctly reporting AME counts) than non-experts, though both groups had mean accuracies greater than 80%. These group differences were also reflected in the EEG correlates of key-change detection post-stimulus, with experts showing more significant, greater magnitude, longer periods of, and earlier peaks in condition-discriminating EEG activity than novices. Using the timing of the maximum discriminating neural correlates, we performed source reconstruction and compared significant differences between cellists and non-musicians. We found significant differences that included a slightly right lateralized motor and frontal source distribution. The right lateralized motor activation is consistent with the cortical representation of the left hand – i.e. the hand a cellist would use, while playing, to generate the anomalous key-changes. In general, these results suggest that sensory anomalies detected by experts may in fact be partially a result of an embodied cognition, with a model of the action for generating the anomaly playing a role in its detection.Creative cognition as a window on creativity - ScienceDirectThe creative cognition approach views creativity as the generation of novel and appropriate products through the application of basic cognitive processes to existing knowledge structures. It relies on converging evidence from anecdotal accounts of creativity and tightly controlled laboratory studies designed to examine the processes that are assumed to operate in those anecdotes. Specific examples of creative cognition studies are described in detail with a particular focus on research concerned with accessing conceptual information at varying levels of abstraction and combining previously separate concepts. Important aspects of the design of these studies are delineated, including the main creative tasks, properties of the materials used, characteristics of responses observed, including their originality and practicality, participant and rater attributes, and the relations among these and other study aspects. Other issues addressed are generality across materials, populations, and situations, as well as causal versus correlational connections among processes, structures and creative outcomes.Leisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectAccumulated evidence shows that leisure activities have a positive impact on cognitive function and dementia. This review aimed to systematically summarize the current evidence on this topic taking into account the limitations of the studies and biological plausibility for the underlying mechanisms linking cognition, dementia and leisure activities, with special attention on mental, physical and social activities. We included only longitudinal studies, with a follow-up time of at least 2 years, published in English from 1991 to March 2011 on leisure activities and cognition (n = 29) or dementia (n = 23) and provided some evidence from intervention studies on the topic. A protective effect of mental activity on cognitive function has been consistently reported in both observational and interventional studies. The association of mental activity with the risk of dementia was robust in observational studies but inconsistent in clinical trials. The protective effect of physical activity on the risk of cognitive decline and dementia has been reported in most observational studies, but has been less evident in interventional studies. Current evidence concerning the beneficial effect of other types of leisure activities on the risk of dementia is still limited and results are inconsistent. For future studies it is imperative that the assessment of leisure activities is standardized, for example, the frequency, intensity, duration and the type of activity; and also that the cognitive test batteries and the definition of cognitive decline are harmonized/standardized. Further, well designed studies with long follow-up times are necessary. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.Leisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirect► We summarized the evidence of the influence of leisure activities on dementia risk. ► Mental activity may protect against dementia and cognitive decline. ► The beneficial effect of physical activity on dementia risk needs to be confirmed. ► The protective role of other types of leisure activities to date is insufficient.Leisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.It's beginning to smell (and sound) a lot like Christmas: the interactive effects of ambient scent and music in a retail setting - ScienceDirectWhile extant research suggests that olfactory and musical stimuli can influence individuals' perceptions and behaviors, the combined or interactive effects of these environmental cues is not well understood. Using stimuli associated with the Christmas holiday season, this research explores the joint effects of ambient scent and music on consumers' evaluations of a store, its environment and offered merchandise. A 2 (no scent vs. Christmas scent)×2 (non-Christmas music vs. Christmas music) experimental design was implemented in a mock retail store. Results indicate that the effects of adding an ambient Christmas scent are moderated by the nature of the background music. In particular, consumers' evaluations are more favorable when the Christmas scent is in the presence of Christmas music. The presence of the Christmas scent with non-Christmas music, however, lowers evaluations. Results and implications of the findings are discussed with regard to retail practice and environmental psychology.The Structure of Cognition: Attentional Episodes in Mind and Brain - ScienceDirectCognition is organized in a structured series of attentional episodes, allowing complex problems to be addressed through solution of simpler subproblems. A “multiple-demand” (MD) system of frontal and parietal cortex is active in many different kinds of tasks, and using data from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive studies of intelligence, I propose a core role for MD regions in assembly of the attentional episode. Monkey and human data show dynamic neural coding of attended information across multiple MD regions, with rapid communication within and between regions. Neuropsychological and imaging data link MD function to fluid intelligence, explaining some but not all “executive” deficits after frontal lobe lesions. Cognitive studies link fluid intelligence to goal neglect, and the problem of dividing complex task requirements into focused parts. Like the innate releasing mechanism of ethology, I suggest that construction of the attentional episode provides a core organizational principle for complex, adaptive cognition.Reactions to music, touch and object presentation in the final stage of dementia: an exploratory study - ScienceDirectTwo patients in the final stage of dementia of Alzheimer type were stimulated with music, touch and object presentation during 12 consecutive days (16 trials per patient). Evaluations were made by direct observations, analysis of video-taped recordings and registrations of pulse and rate of respiration. Both patients reacted differently to music than to touch and object presentation.Reactions to music, touch and object presentation in the final stage of dementia: an exploratory study - ScienceDirectThis paper has previously been published in International Journal of Nursing Studies (1986), 23, 315–323.The aesthetic discourse space of popular music: 1985–86 and 2004–05 - ScienceDirectThis article presents a comparison of the aesthetic classification system of popular music, as employed by newspaper critics in the Los Angeles Times during 1985–86 and 2004–05. Through a relational discourse analysis of popular music album reviews, which applies the ecological technique of measuring niche spaces occupied by genres in an ‘aesthetic discourse space’, the genre structure of popular music is compared across a time period in which the field of popular music has arguably undergone a growing ‘isomorphism’ of aesthetic principles and a blurring of boundaries between genres. Comparison of genre structures at two points in time suggests that the perception and interpretation of diverse genres has become more similar. Moreover, the boundary between two exemplary genres – rock music and pop music – has apparently become less salient for music critics, possibly signaling a weakening of commercial boundaries within the popular music field over the last two decades.The aesthetic discourse space of popular music: 1985–86 and 2004–05 - ScienceDirectAlex van Venrooij is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Arts and Culture Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam. His research concerns cross-national differences and longitudinal changes in the evaluation and classification of popular music.Perspectives on the Neuroscience of Cognition and Consciousness - ScienceDirectThe origin and current use of the concepts of computation, representation and information in Neuroscience are examined and conceptual flaws are identified which vitiate their usefulness for addressing the problem of the neural basis of Cognition and Consciousness. In contrast, a convergence of views is presented to support the characterization of the Nervous System as a complex dynamical system operating in a metastable regime, and capable of evolving to configurations and transitions in phase space with potential relevance for Cognition and Consciousness.Production, convention and power: Constructing the sound of an Early Music orchestra - ScienceDirectBy explaining how an Early Music orchestra produces its sound, we can review Howard Becker's concept of a convention. An orchestra's sound depends on principles incorporated in things (musical instruments, scores) and bodies (musicians' techniques). A common set of principles about interpreting a piece of music — principles acquired well before any rehearsal — do not suffice for coordinating a group of musicians. As observations have shown, face-to-face interactions are decisive in this coordination. The conductor is not omniscient and does not impose his interpretation on musicians. Relations based on authority, being unstable, are redistributed among the conductor, soloist and first violin during rehearsals. Recognizing the importance of face-to-face interactions draws attention to the cogency of power relations, which, though omnipresent, are constantly reworked in the situation for producing an orchestra's sound.A music therapy clinical case study of a girl with childhood apraxia of speech: Finding Lily's voice - ScienceDirectThis clinical case study describes a 3-year-old girl diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech and her progress in weekly music therapy. The child was seen for a total of 24 sessions over a period of 9 months. The music therapy treatment involved a mixture of behavioral, improvisational, and creative approaches in what has been termed a data-based music therapy approach. A variety of musical interventions, visual, and interactive aids were used, as well as an engaging, playful dialogue between child and the clinician. The child's communicative methods at the beginning of her treatment process were almost exclusively non-verbal. By the final session, she was pronouncing a number of syllables, combination sounds, and words. The treatment program is described as it unfolded in three phases, and significant events from each individual session are described in detail.Verbal assault in Fújì music: The case of Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and Kollington Ayinla - ScienceDirectMusic is an essential tool in the propagation of cultural values. It is informative, educative, and didactic. However, it is also used for negative purposes, one of which is to settle an old score. This worrisome use has been the bane of Nigerian indigenous music, particularly Fújì music. In this paper, the conflict between the two most prominent Fújì musicians – Barrister and Kollington – on the origin of Fújì music is X-rayed through Critical Discourse Analysis, with particular emphasis on face. Transcribed texts of the albums of the two of them which relate to verbal assault were used for the analysis. Despite the fact that the two artistes do not mention each other's name, historical, textual, and contextual facts reveal that they are actually addressing each other. In their albums analyzed, both of them show flagrant disrespect for each other's positive and negative faces, as they pour invective on each other without any attempt at redressing their Face Threatening Acts, except Barrister who occasionally redresses his. They damage each other's social standing, mental state and physical state, against the Yoruba cultural norms.Verbal assault in Fújì music: The case of Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and Kollington Ayinla - ScienceDirectDr. Adesina B.

(2009) show that the human form of the FOXP2 gene increases synaptic plasticity and dendrite connectivity in the basal ganglia. These results partly explain the enhanced capability of cortico-basal ganglia circuits in the human brain that regulate critical aspects of language, cognition, and motor control.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectTo determine whether playing music or blocking noise can reduce bispectral index (BIS) values during propofol sedation.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectProspective, randomized, single-blinded study.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectOperating room.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirect63 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 55 to 75 years, undergoing total knee replacement.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectPatients were divided into three groups: noise, silence, and music. After induction of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, sedation was begun with 1.2 μg/mL of propofol in a target-controlled infusion. In the silence group, patients' ears were packed tightly to block ambient noise, whereas patient-selected music was applied to patients in the music group. Patients in the noise group were exposed to ambient operating room noise.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectBispectral index measurement was recorded 7 times during operation. Ambient room noise was recorded at the same time sequence.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectSound level was highest when the saw (T3, 80.25 dB) and the impact device (T4, 80.98 dB) were in use. Bispectral index scores in the silence group during those times (T3, 68.5 vs 76.9, P = 0.025, and T4, 67.6 vs 78, P = 0.005) were lower than in the noise group. However, BIS scores were similar in the noise and music groups. Preoperative anxiety level, postoperative comfort level, and pain scores were similar in all groups.Blocking noise but not music lowers bispectral index scores during sedation in noisy operating rooms - ScienceDirectBlocking noise is more effective than playing music in reducing BIS scores during propofol sedation in a noisy environment.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to verify the influence of music introduced in different moments in a 5-km time-trial cycling (TT5KM) on psychophysical variables.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectTen trained cyclists participated in this study (24 ± 1 years; 73.5 ± 10.4 kg; 180 ± 12 cm). The participants performed the TT5KM in three distinct conditions: music during warm-up (MW), music during the protocol (MP) and control (C). During all conditions the time (T), power output (W), heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was evaluated and the mood state was assessed with the BRUMS questionnaire. After descriptive statistics, data normality was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk's test. Mean performance, performance at each 500 m, RPE at each 1000 m and mood state were compared with ANOVA two way for repeated measures (moment x condition). The significance level was set at p < 0.05. A parallel statistic was used to find the smallest worthwhile change of all variables to verify the possibility of the effect to be trivial, beneficial or prejudicial.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectNone of the variables showed any difference between groups (p > 0.05), but there is a possibility of RPE to be smaller when the subject listen music during (90%) or before (93%) the test compared with control condition.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectOur results showed that regardless the time of application (i.e., before or during exercise), music did not affect performance and psychophysiological parameters during the TT5KM.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectEl propósito de este estudio fue verificar la influencia de la música introducida en diferentes momentos en una contrarreloj de ciclismo de 5 km sobre las variables psicofisiológicas.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectDiez ciclistas entrenados participaron en este estudio (24 ± 1 años; 73,5 ± 10,4 kg, 180 ± 12 cm). Los participantes realizaron la contrarreloj de ciclismo de 5 km en 3 condiciones diferentes: música durante el precalentamiento, música durante el protocolo y control. Durante todas las condiciones fue evaluado el tiempo, la potencia, la frecuencia cardíaca y la percepción subjetiva de esfuerzo, y el estado de humor fue evaluado con el cuestionario BRUMS. Después de la estadística descriptiva, la normalidad de los datos fue confirmada por el test de Shapiro-Wilk. La media de rendimiento, el rendimiento a cada 500 m, percepción subjetiva de esfuerzo a cada 1.000 m y el estado de humor fueron comparados con la ANOVA de 2 factores para medidas repetidas (momento x condición). El nivel de significancia fue fijado en p < 0,05. Una estadística paralela fue utilizada para encontrar la menor variación de valor de todas las variables y de esta forma verificar la posibilidad de que el efecto sea trivial, benéfico o perjudicial.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectNinguna de las variables presentó diferencia entre los grupos (p > 0,05), pero existe una posibilidad de que su percepción subjetiva de esfuerzo sea pequeña cuando el individuo escucha música durante (90%) o antes (93%) del test en comparación con el test de condición de control.Influence of music and its moments of application on performance and psychophysiological parameters during a 5 km time trial - ScienceDirectNuestros resultados mostraron que con independencia del momento de aplicación (por ejemplo, antes o durante el ejercicio), la música no afectó al rendimiento y las variables psicofisiológicas durante una contrarreloj de ciclismo de 5 km.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectPupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectPupillary responses reflect hierarchical meter even while participants are engaged in another task.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectHierarchical beat perception thus requires no or only minimal attention.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectBeat perception was not modulated by musical expertise.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectPupil dilation indexes the violation of expectancy in the absence of attention.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectThe perception of music is a complex interaction between what we hear and our interpretation. This is reflected in beat perception, in which a listener infers a regular pulse from a musical rhythm. Although beat perception is a fundamental human ability, it is still unknown whether attention to the music is necessary to establish the perception of stronger and weaker beats, or meter. In addition, to what extent beat perception is dependent on musical expertise is still a matter of debate. Here, we address these questions by measuring the pupillary response to omissions at different metrical positions in drum rhythms, while participants attended to another task. We found that the omission of the salient first beat elicited a larger pupil dilation than the omission of the less-salient second beat. This result shows that participants not only detected the beat without explicit attention to the music, but also perceived a metrical hierarchy of stronger and weaker beats. This suggests that hierarchical beat perception is an automatic process that requires no or minimal attentional resources. In addition, we found no evidence for the hypothesis that hierarchical beat perception is affected by musical expertise, suggesting that elementary beat perception might be independent from musical expertise. Finally, our results show that pupil dilation reflects surprise without explicit attention, demonstrating that the pupil is an accessible index to signatures of unattentive processing.Exposure to music in the perinatal period enhances learning performance and alters BDNF/TrkB signaling in mice as adults - ScienceDirectMusic has been suggested to have a beneficial effect on various types of performance in humans. However, the physiological and molecular mechanism of this effect remains unclear. We examined the effect of music exposure during the perinatal period on learning behavior in adult mice, and measured the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), which play critical roles in synaptic plasticity. In addition, we measured the levels of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), downstream targets of two main pathways in BDNF/TrkB signaling. Music-exposed mice completed a maze learning task with fewer errors than the white noise-exposed mice and had lower levels of BDNF and higher levels of TrkB and PDK1 in the cortex. MAPK levels were unchanged. Furthermore, TrkB and PDK1 protein levels in the cortex showed a significant negative correlation with the number of errors on the maze. These results suggest that perinatal exposure of mice to music has an influence on BDNF/TrkB signaling and its intracellular signaling pathway targets, including PDK1, and thus may induce improved learning and memory functions.Neural substrates of processing syntax and semantics in music - ScienceDirectGrowing evidence indicates that syntax and semantics are basic aspects of music. After the onset of a chord, initial music–syntactic processing can be observed at about 150–400 ms and processing of musical semantics at about 300–500 ms. Processing of musical syntax activates inferior frontolateral cortex, ventrolateral premotor cortex and presumably the anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus. These brain structures have been implicated in sequencing of complex auditory information, identification of structural relationships, and serial prediction. Processing of musical semantics appears to activate posterior temporal regions. The processes and brain structures involved in the perception of syntax and semantics in music have considerable overlap with those involved in language perception, underlining intimate links between music and language in the human brain.“The role of chaos in cognition and music – super selection rules moderating complexity” – a research program - ScienceDirectWe propose a common formalism concerning the non-linear filtering abilities of brains and enzymes via the study of the unevenness of the invariant measures of the multifractal attractors involved (classical and quantum respectively).Analysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectAnalysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectConstructive teaching conceptions are related to constructive teaching practices.Analysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectConstructive teaching involves dialogic interactions and student-centered practices.Analysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectThis teacher is more constructive in the learning conditions and processes.Analysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectThis teacher's student is intrinsically motivated and learns in a complex manner.Analysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectThis teacher's student is quite autonomous and has a good self-esteem.Analysis of constructive practice in instrumental music education: Case study with an expert cello teacher - ScienceDirectA case study was conducted on an expert cello teacher and a 7-year-old student, to analyze the relationships between the teacher's constructive conceptions and instructional practices, by means of the System for Analyzing the Practice of Instrumental Lessons. This article describes a constructive teaching model based on: (a) the student's learning processes, (b) fostering conditions that enable learning and (c) achieving long-lasting learning outcomes which are student-driven and applicable to other situations.

Nevertheless, in principle sound offers much to the process of human–computer interaction as for most people the notion of auditory imagery is easily accepted.Using music to communicate computing information - ScienceDirectIn this paper we explore how sound, specifically musical sound, can be used to communicate computing information. The findings of two studies are presented. The first investigated how pitch intervals and musical phrases of complex (non-sinusoidal) tones can be recognised. The second study aimed to demonstrate that musical structures could communicate information about high-level programming language structures and program run-time behaviour. Both studies showed that music could successfully be used as a communication medium and that listeners did not need to be musically trained to benefit from the audio signals. Finally, recommendations for further work are made.Science and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neurocognitive impairment is associated with corpus callosum atrophy in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectThe objective of this study was to evaluate the association between annualized corpus callosum (aCC) atrophy and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. This is a cohort study of clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis (CIS) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients based on an analysis of serial MRI examinations. The validated Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC) was used to assess cognitive dysfunction. 39% of patients (n = 17, mean score 15.5 ± 2.9) had cognitive dysfunction and 61% (n = 27, mean score 23.6 ± 2.5) had no signs of cognitive impairment. Overall mean annualized corpus callosum index (aCCI) change was −0.72% ± 0.96%. Patients with cognitive dysfunction presented higher aCCI reduction: 0.95% ± 0.78% in comparison with patients without signs of cognitive impairment: 0.57% ± 1.06% (p = 0.044). Multivariate analysis revealed that aCC atrophy (β = 227.1; p = 0.05) was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment (adjusted R2 = 0.355; F = 1.777; p = 0.02). Progression of aCC atrophy is associated with the development of cognitive dysfunction in MS patients.ComPLuS model: A new insight in pupils’ collaborative talk, actions and balance during a computer-mediated music task - ScienceDirectThis exploratory work describes and analyses the collaborative interactions that emerge during computer-based music composition in the primary school. The study draws on socio-cultural theories of learning, originated within Vygotsky’s theoretical context, and proposes a new model, namely Computer-mediated Praxis and Logos under Synergy (ComPLuS). In this model, peers’ dialogue is categorised into five types; disputational, cumulative, exploratory, operational, and reflective, with each one corresponding to different types of spoken contributions. Moreover, peers’ actions are categorised as individual or joint and are used to evaluate the effect of computer mediation on the collaborative activity and its balance within a pair. The potential and effectiveness of the realisation of the ComPLuS model in practice, as far as peers’ collaboration is concerned, are evaluated from its trialling in an experimental case-study, in which a group of 11-yr old pupils worked in pairs to compose short melodies using computers at the computer room of their school. Emphasis was placed upon the types of social modes of thinking with regard to pupils’ spoken contributions and talk types during their conversation; pupils’ actions when manipulating software, and the balance of talk and action between the pair members. Their ongoing peer–to-peer communication and actions formed the research data. A mixed (qualitative and quantitative) analysis revealed that peers usually adopted cumulative and exploratory talk. Moreover, the action type which dominated their work was based on a consensual decision. Nevertheless, it was found that lead on collaborative talk does not mean lead on joint action and does not always sustain a balance in peers’ collaboration. Experimentation with the music software, in conjunction with pupils’ musical background, facilitated their joint action, exploratory and reflective talk. However, audio feedback provided by the software did not seem to affect peers’ talk types. These results suggest that the ComPLuS model captures the characteristics of peers’ collaborative interactions during their shared discussions and actions, and can lead to a better understanding of the nature of computer-supported collaborative creativity in primary music education.ComPLuS model: A new insight in pupils’ collaborative talk, actions and balance during a computer-mediated music task - ScienceDirect► Collaborative interactions analyses during pupils’ computer-based music composition. ► Proposition of the Computer-mediated Praxis and Logos under Synergy model. ► Cumulative/exploratory talk along with consensual decision-based actions dominate. ► Collaborative talk does not imply joint action or sustain a balanced collaboration. ► Audio feedback provided by the software did not seem to affect peers’ talk types.Infant music perception: Domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms? - ScienceDirectWe review the literature on infants’ perception of pitch and temporal patterns, relating it to comparable research with human adult and non-human listeners. Although there are parallels in relative pitch processing across age and species, there are notable differences. Infants accomplish such tasks with ease, but non-human listeners require extensive training to achieve very modest levels of performance. In general, human listeners process auditory sequences in a holistic manner, and non-human listeners focus on absolute aspects of individual tones. Temporal grouping processes and categorization on the basis of rhythm are evident in non-human listeners and in human infants and adults. Although synchronization to sound patterns is thought to be uniquely human, tapping to music, synchronous firefly flashing, and other cyclic behaviors can be described by similar mathematical principles. We conclude that infants’ music perception skills are a product of general perceptual mechanisms that are neither music- nor species-specific. Along with general-purpose mechanisms for the perceptual foundations of music, we suggest unique motivational mechanisms that can account for the perpetuation of musical behavior in all human societies.Fractal dimension and classification of music - ScienceDirectThe fractal aspect of different kinds of music was analyzed in keeping with the time domain. The fractal dimension of a great number of different musics (180 scores) is calculated by the Variation method. By using an analysis of variance, it is shown that fractal dimension helps discriminate different categories of music. Then, we used an original statistical technique based on the Bootstrap assumption to find a time window in which fractal dimension reaches a high power of music discrimination. The best discrimination is obtained between 1/44100 and 16/44100 Hertz. We admit that to distinguish some different aspects of music well, the high information quantity is obtained in the high frequency domain. By calculating fractal dimension with the ANAM method, it was statistically proven that fractal dimension could distinguish different kinds of music very well: musics could be classified by their fractal dimensions.Evaluating a servicescape: the effect of cognition and emotion - ScienceDirectThe debate among researchers regarding whether cognition precedes emotion or emotion precedes cognition in individuals’ evaluation process still remains unresolved and ambiguous. This paper attempts to review literature relating to the impact of the servicescape on customer behavior, with emphasis on the concept of Gestalt psychology. The Gestalt approach serves as a guide to understand and explain how an individual forms an impression or a perceptual image of a servicescape, how the image formation then leads to an emotional response, and finally, the actual appraisal or evaluation of a specific service environment.The Role of the Cerebellum in Cognition: Beyond Coordination in the Central Nervous System - ScienceDirectThe author has nothing to disclose.The Role of the Cerebellum in Cognition: Beyond Coordination in the Central Nervous System - ScienceDirectConflict of Interest: None.Using Orff-based techniques in children's bereavement groups: A cognitive-behavioral music therapy approach - ScienceDirectChildren affected by the death of a loved one can face multiple challenges including difficulties identifying and dealing with emotions, impaired social interactions, distorted thoughts, and behavioral problems. The inclusive and engaging nature of music-based therapeutic experiences provides children with a developmentally appropriate way to address a variety of needs. This article describes the use of Orff-based music therapy interventions in a cognitive-behavioral framework to assist children through the grieving process. The Orff-based music therapy program provides opportunities for emotional healing, building positive social relationships, cognitive reframing, and decreasing behavioral problems. The philosophy of cognitive-behavioral music therapy is articulated, and session goals and objectives are stated. Sample Orff-based music therapy sessions are provided with a rationale for their use.The Mozart Effect: A quantitative EEG study - ScienceDirectThe Mozart Effect: A quantitative EEG study - ScienceDirectMozart Effect is an enhancement of performance/change in neurophysiological activity.The Mozart Effect: A quantitative EEG study - ScienceDirectOur results shows more alpha band EEG pattern after listening to Mozart’s music.The Mozart Effect: A quantitative EEG study - ScienceDirectMore alpha band is linked to memory, cognition and open mind to problem solving.The Mozart Effect: A quantitative EEG study - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Mozart’s music on brain activity through spectral analysis of the EEG in young healthy adults (Adults), in healthy elderly (Elderly) and in elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). EEG recording was performed at basal rest conditions and after listening to Mozart’s K448 or “Fur Elise” Beethoven’s sonatas. After listening to Mozart, an increase of alpha band and median frequency index of background alpha rhythm activity (a pattern of brain wave activity linked to memory, cognition and open mind to problem solving) was observed both in Adults and in Elderly. No changes were observed in MCI. After listening to Beethoven, no changes in EEG activity were detected. This results may be representative of the fact that said Mozart’s music is able to “activate” neuronal cortical circuits related to attentive and cognitive functions.The Mozart Effect: A quantitative EEG study - ScienceDirectDownload full-size imageSocially Situated Cognition: Cognition in its Social Context - ScienceDirectThis chapter proposes a new integration of social psychology and situated cognition—that is, socially situated cognition (SSC). This new approach rests directly on recent developments in psychology and cognitive science captured by the label situated cognition. It highlights four core assumptions that are common to social psychology and the situated cognition perspective: Cognition is for the adaptive regulation of action, and mental representations are action oriented; cognition is embodied, drawing on our sensorimotor abilities and environments as well as human brains; cognition and action are the emergent outcome of dynamic processes of interaction between an agent and an environment; and cognition is distributed across brains and the environment and across social agents. With regard to each of these themes, the chapter reviews and integrates relevant social psychological research and suggests ways in which the theme can be advanced by rethinking current assumptions. The overall goals are to make social psychology part of the interdisciplinary integration emerging around the concept of situated cognition, and to advance these four themes as high-level conceptual principles that can organize seemingly disparate areas of research and theory within social psychology itself.The biology and evolution of music: A comparative perspective - ScienceDirectStudies of the biology of music (as of language) are highly interdisciplinary and demand the integration of diverse strands of evidence. In this paper, I present a comparative perspective on the biology and evolution of music, stressing the value of comparisons both with human language, and with those animal communication systems traditionally termed “song”. A comparison of the “design features” of music with those of language reveals substantial overlap, along with some important differences. Most of these differences appear to stem from semantic, rather than structural, factors, suggesting a shared formal core of music and language. I next review various animal communication systems that appear related to human music, either by analogy (bird and whale “song”) or potential homology (great ape bimanual drumming). A crucial comparative distinction is between learned, complex signals (like language, music and birdsong) and unlearned signals (like laughter, ape calls, or bird calls). While human vocalizations clearly build upon an acoustic and emotional foundation shared with other primates and mammals, vocal learning has evolved independently in our species since our divergence with chimpanzees. The convergent evolution of vocal learning in other species offers a powerful window into psychological and neural constraints influencing the evolution of complex signaling systems (including both song and speech), while ape drumming presents a fascinating potential homology with human instrumental music. I next discuss the archeological data relevant to music evolution, concluding on the basis of prehistoric bone flutes that instrumental music is at least 40,000 years old, and perhaps much older. I end with a brief review of adaptive functions proposed for music, concluding that no one selective force (e.g., sexual selection) is adequate to explaining all aspects of human music. I suggest that questions about the past function of music are unlikely to be answered definitively and are thus a poor choice as a research focus for biomusicology. In contrast, a comparative approach to music promises rich dividends for our future understanding of the biology and evolution of music.Relationships between early literacy and nonlinguistic rhythmic processes in kindergarteners - ScienceDirectRelationships between early literacy and nonlinguistic rhythmic processes in kindergarteners - ScienceDirectMusical rhythm processing is associated with early literacy.Relationships between early literacy and nonlinguistic rhythmic processes in kindergarteners - ScienceDirectPhonological awareness mediates the association between rhythm and literacy.Relationships between early literacy and nonlinguistic rhythmic processes in kindergarteners - ScienceDirectProcessing of temporal regularity is a uniquely important aspect of this relationship.Relationships between early literacy and nonlinguistic rhythmic processes in kindergarteners - ScienceDirectA growing number of studies report links between nonlinguistic rhythmic abilities and certain linguistic abilities, particularly phonological skills. The current study investigated the relationship between nonlinguistic rhythmic processing, phonological abilities, and early literacy abilities in kindergarteners. A distinctive aspect of the current work was the exploration of whether processing of different types of rhythmic patterns is differentially related to kindergarteners’ phonological and reading-related abilities. Specifically, we examined the processing of metrical versus nonmetrical rhythmic patterns, that is, patterns capable of being subdivided into equal temporal intervals or not (Povel & Essens, 1985). This is an important comparison because most music involves metrical sequences, in which rhythm often has an underlying temporal grid of isochronous units. In contrast, nonmetrical sequences are arguably more typical to speech rhythm, which is temporally structured but does not involve an underlying grid of equal temporal units. A rhythm discrimination app with metrical and nonmetrical patterns was administered to 74 kindergarteners in conjunction with cognitive and preliteracy measures. Findings support a relationship among rhythm perception, phonological awareness, and letter-sound knowledge (an essential precursor of reading). A mediation analysis revealed that the association between rhythm perception and letter-sound knowledge is mediated through phonological awareness. Furthermore, metrical perception accounted for unique variance in letter-sound knowledge above all other language and cognitive measures. These results point to a unique role for temporal regularity processing in the association between musical rhythm and literacy in young children.FMRI investigation of cross-cultural music comprehension - ScienceDirectThe popular view of music as a “universal” language ignores the privileged position of the cultural insider in comprehending musical information unique to their own tradition. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that listeners would demonstrate different neural activity in response to culturally familiar and unfamiliar music and that those differences may be affected by the extent of subjects' formal musical training. Just as familiar languages have been shown to use distinct brain processes, we hypothesized that an analogous difference might be found in music and that it may depend in part on subjects' formal musical knowledge. Using fMRI we compared the activation patterns of professional musicians and untrained controls reared in the United States as they listened to music from their culture (Western) and from an unfamiliar culture (Chinese). No overall differences in activation were observed for either subject group in response to the two musical styles, although there were differences in recall performance based on style and there were activation differences based on training. Trained listeners demonstrated additional activation in the right STG for both musics and in the right and left midfrontal regions for Western music and Chinese music, respectively. Our findings indicate that listening to culturally different musics may activate similar neural resources but with dissimilar results in recall performance.The spatiotemporal characteristics of elementary audiovisual speech and music processing in musically untrained subjects - ScienceDirectPreviously, the EEG technique has been used to investigate the spatiotemporal properties of audiovisual (AV) processing by taking advantage of the violation of the “additive model”, which is considered to be a very conservative approach. In the present work, we used a less conservative and novel approach than the criterion of superadditivity for estimating AV interactions. Hence, we estimated AV interaction patterns by comparing the responses to AV stimuli with the averaged responses to the unimodal visual and auditory stimuli in musically untrained subjects and by presenting syllables and piano tones coupled with flashlights. Our results suggest that the two AV objects elicited consistent interaction patterns within the time course of unisensory processing in the time range between 80 and 250 ms post stimulus onset. The scalp topographies, as well as the source estimation approach we adopted, indicate that the first interaction pattern at around 100 ms was partially driven by auditory-related cortical regions. Additionally, we found evidence for a second interaction pattern at around 200 ms that was mainly associated with the responsiveness of extra-sensory brain regions. During this later processing stage, only the music condition was associated with putative responses that originated from auditory-related cortical fields. This study provides a novel approach to investigate the basic principles underlying elementary AV speech and music processing in subjects without formal musical education.The spatiotemporal characteristics of elementary audiovisual speech and music processing in musically untrained subjects - ScienceDirect► We investigated AV interactions related to speech and music processing. ► We found interaction effects within the time course of unisensory processing. ► AV interactions at around 100 ms were partially driven by auditory-related regions. ► AV interactions at around 200 ms were more likely related to extra-sensory brain regions.Differentiation of classical music requires little learning but rhythm - ScienceDirectDetecting distinctions between the styles of classical music (e.g. Baroque and Romantic) is often viewed as the privilege of musicians. However, this elite perspective underestimates the abilities of non-musicians. We report that Western musicians and non-musicians, and non-Westerners (i.e. Chinese participants) rated pairs of excerpts presented auditorily as more similar as their compositional styles were closer in history. Moreover, the styles were considered by all participants as more different when presented in historical order, the older style preceding the more recent style (e.g. Baroque followed by Romantic), than the reverse (e.g. Romantic followed by Baroque). This historical distance effect appears related to rhythm (or temporal variability).Infants' perception of consonance and dissonance in music - ScienceDirectThe origins of the perception of consonance and dissonance in music are a matter of debate. The present study examined the hypothesis of an innate preferential bias favoring consonance over dissonance by exposing 4 month old infants to consonant and dissonant versions of two melodies. Infants looked significantly longer at the source of sound and were less motorically active to consonant compared with dissonant versions of each melody. Further, fretting and turning away from the music source occurred more frequently during the dissonant than the consonant versions. The results suggest that infants are biologically prepared to treat consonance as perceptually more pleasing than dissonance.Infants' perception of consonance and dissonance in music - ScienceDirectMarcel R. Zentner, Department of Psychology, University of Geneva, 9 Rte de Drize, CH-1227 Geneva-CarougeAlzheimer's Disease: rhythm, timing and music as therapy - ScienceDirectActive music-making provides a form of therapy for the Alzheimer's patient which may stimulate cognitive activities such that areas subject to progressive failure are maintained. Anecdotal evidence suggests that quality of life of Alzheimer's patients is significantly improved with music therapy, accompanied by the overall social benefits of acceptance and sense of belonging gained by communicating with others. Music therapy, when based on clear treatment objectives can reduce the individual prescription of tranquillising medication, reduce the use of hypnotics and help overall goals of rehabilitation. Mood improvement and self-expression, the stimulation of speech and organisation of mental processes; and sensory stimulation and motor integration are promoted. Given that the rate of deterioration in Alzheimer's disease is not predictable, a series of single case experimental designs would generate valuable empirical data concerning treatment outcome and promote basic research into the timing functions required for the co-ordination of cognition, physiology, motor ability and the integrity of behaviour.Complementary aspects of emotions and music - ScienceDirectComment on Physics of Life Reviews target article: “Musical emotions: Functions, origins, evolution,” by L. Perlovsky.Gait in ageing and associated dementias; its relationship with cognition - ScienceDirectThe focus of this review is on the close relationship between gait and cognition in ageing and associated dementias. This close relationship is supported by epidemiological studies, clinical studies of older people with and without dementia that focused on the intensity of the physical activity, clinical studies with older persons without dementia examining a relationship between gait and specific cognitive processes, and human and animal experimental studies examining a neural basis for such a relationship.Gait in ageing and associated dementias; its relationship with cognition - ScienceDirectDespite these findings, most studies with patients with dementia focus exclusively on the relationship between cognition and dementia, with relatively few addressing the relationship between gait and dementia. However, subtle disturbances in gait can be observed in ageing and in (preclinical) subtypes of dementia that are not known for prominent motor disturbances, i.e. Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, vascular Cognitive Impairment No Dementia, Subcortical Ischaemic Vascular Dementia, Frontotemporal Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Frontotemporal Dementia, supporting a close relationship between gait and cognition.Gait in ageing and associated dementias; its relationship with cognition - ScienceDirectThe relationship between gait and cognition is weakened by the few available intervention studies that examine the effects of walking on cognition in patients with (preclinical) dementia. These studies report equivocal results, which will be discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research will be made.Holding on to our functional roots when exploring new intellectual islands: A voyage through implicit cognition research - ScienceDirectThroughout much of the past two decades, contextual behavioral science has been applied to a diverse spectrum of psychological phenomena. This intellectual voyage into uncharted waters has brought with it exciting new developments at the methodological and theoretical levels as well as increased contact with other philosophical frameworks such as mechanism. This expansion into new territories requires that the researcher carefully walk a tight-rope between different intellectual traditions—an activity that is subject to several challenges and dangers. In the following paper we provide a detailed map on how to navigate such pitfalls in the study of implicit cognition. We open with a comprehensive overview of the core assumptions and analytic strategies upon which the cognitive (mechanistic) and functional (contextual) traditions have been built. As we shall see, both traditions have sought to understand, predict, and in some cases influence, behavior using radically different conceptual, theoretical and methodological tools. The Relational Elaboration and Coherence (REC) model as well as the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) are offered as examples of how researchers can explore the domain of implicit cognition from a purely functional perspective. Finally, we examine the possibility that although the cognitive and functional frameworks operate at two independent levels of analysis each may be mutually informed by the work of the other, to the benefit of both.Holding on to our functional roots when exploring new intellectual islands: A voyage through implicit cognition research - ScienceDirect► Provide a comprehensive overview of the cognitive and functional approaches to implicit cognition. ► Examine the Relational Elaboration and Coherence model and Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. ► Apply the REC and IRAP to the study of implicit cognition. ► Explore the possibility for fruitful dialog between the cognitive and functional traditions.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectMusical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectGreat poets and musical composers are rare or nonexistent in people with epilepsy.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectHikari Oe is a composer with autism and epilepsy who writes simple music.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectFew great poets have had epilepsy or seizures.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectMusic and poetry share meter, tone, stress, rhythm, and form.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectEpilepsy affects cognition, essential for the composition of great music and poetry.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectAssociations between epilepsy and musical or poetic composition have received little attention. We reviewed the literature on links between poetic and musical skills and epilepsy, limiting this to the Western canon. While several composers were said to have had epilepsy, John Hughes concluded that none of the major classical composers thought to have had epilepsy actually had it. The only composer with epilepsy that we could find was the contemporary composer, Hikari Oe, who has autism and developed epilepsy at age 15 years. In his childhood years, his mother found that he had an ability to identify bird sound and keys of songs and began teaching him piano. Hikari is able to compose in his head when his seizures are not severe, but when his seizures worsen, his creativity is lost. Music critics have commented on the simplicity of his musical composition and its monotonous sound.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectOur failure to find evidence of musical composers with epilepsy finds parallels with poetry where there are virtually no established poets with epilepsy. Those with seizures include Lord George Byron in the setting of terminal illness, Algernon Swinburne who had alcohol-related seizures, Charles Lloyd who had seizures and psychosis, Edward Lear who had childhood onset seizures, and Vachel Lindsay. The possibility that Emily Dickinson had epilepsy is also discussed.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectIt has not been possible to identify great talents with epilepsy who excel in poetic or musical composition. There are few published poets with epilepsy and no great composers. Why is this? Similarities between music and poetry include meter, tone, stress, rhythm, and form, and much poetry is sung with music. It is likely that great musical and poetic compositions demand a greater degree of concentration and memory than is possible in epilepsy, resulting in problems retaining a musical and mathematical structure over time. The lack of association between recognizable neuropsychiatric disorders and these skills is a gateway to understanding facets of the relationship between the brain and creativity.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled “Epilepsy, Art, and Creativity”.Music-induced mood modulates the strength of emotional negativity bias: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe present study investigated the effect of music-elicited moods on the subsequent affective processing through a music-primed valence categorization task. Event-related potentials were recorded for positive and negative emotional pictures that were primed by happy or sad music excerpts. The reaction time data revealed longer reaction times (RTs) for pictures following negative versus positive music pieces, irrespective of the valence of the picture. Additionally, positive pictures elicited faster response latencies than negative pictures, irrespective of the valence of the musical prime. Moreover, the main effect of picture valence, and the music by picture valence interaction effect were both significant for P2 amplitudes and for the averaged amplitudes at 500–700 ms interval. Negative pictures elicited smaller P2 amplitudes than positive pictures, and the amplitude differences between negative and positive pictures were larger with negative musical primes than with positive musical primes. Similarly, compared to positive pictures, negative pictures elicited more negative deflections during the 500–700 ms interval across prime types. The amplitude differences between negative and positive pictures were again larger under negative versus positive music primes at this interval. Therefore, the present study observed a clear emotional negativity bias during either prime condition, and extended the previous findings by showing increased strength of the negative bias under negative mood primes. This suggests that the neural sensitivity of the brain to negative stimuli varies with individuals’ mood states, and this bias is particularly intensified by negative mood states.Congenital amusias - ScienceDirectIn contrast to the sophisticated music processing reported in the general population, individuals with congenital amusia show deficits in music perception and production. Congenital amusia occurs without brain damage, sensory or cognitive deficits, and has been suggested as a lifelong deficit with genetic origin. Even though recognized for a long time, this disorder has been systematically studied only relatively recently for its behavioral and neural correlates. The currently most investigated hypothesis about the underlying deficits concerns the pitch dimension, notably with impaired pitch discrimination and memory. Anatomic and functional investigations of pitch processing revealed that the amusic brain presents abnormalities in the auditory and inferior frontal cortices, associated with decreased connectivity between these structures. The deficit also impairs processing of pitch in speech material and processing of the time dimension in music for some of the amusic individuals, but does not seem to affect spatial processing. Some studies suggest at least partial dissociation in the disorder between perception and production. Recent studies revealed spared implicit pitch perception in congenital amusia, supporting the power of implicit cognition in the music domain. Current challenges consist in defining different subtypes of congenital amusia as well as developing rehabilitation programs for this “musical handicap.”Non-musicians’ perception of phrase boundaries in music: A cross-cultural ERP study - ScienceDirectThe present study investigates neural responses to musical phrase boundaries in subjects without formal musical training, with special emphasis on the issue of cultural familiarity (i.e., the relation between the enculturation of the subjects and the cultural style of the presented music). German and Chinese non-musicians listened to Western and Chinese melodies which contained manipulated phrase boundaries while event-related potentials (ERP) were measured. The behavioral data clearly showed that melodic phrase boundary perception is influenced by cultural familiarity. The ERP revealed a series of positive and negative peaks with latencies between 40 ms and 550 ms relative to the phrase boundary offset, all of which were influenced by the phrase melodic structure type. In contrast, cultural familiarity only influenced phrase boundary processing at longer latencies, reflected by a P3-like component peaking at 280 ms.Non-musicians’ perception of phrase boundaries in music: A cross-cultural ERP study - ScienceDirectAt about 450–600 ms post phrase boundary offset, we observed a slightly right-lateralized music closure positive shift (CPS), which has been reported as a marker for phrase boundary processing in musicians in earlier studies. This study demonstrates for the first time that the music CPS can be elicited in non-musicians, suggesting that the underlying phrase boundary processing does not require formal musical training.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectEffect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectDietary flavanols increase locomotion during early development in pubertal mice.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectDietary flavanol supplementation alters spatial learning in young adult mice.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectDietary flavanols decrease CBF in the thalamus and cortex of young adult mice.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectEvidence suggests that flavanol consumption can beneficially affect cognition in adults, but little is known about the effect of flavanol intake early in life. The present study aims to assess the effect of dietary flavanol intake during the gestational and postnatal period on brain structure, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cognition, and brain metabolism in C57BL/6J mice.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectFemale wild-type C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a flavanol supplemented diet or a control diet at gestational day 0. Male offspring remained on the corresponding diets throughout life and performed cognitive and behavioral tests during puberty and adulthood assessing locomotion and exploration (Phenotyper and open field), sensorimotor integration (Rotarod and prepulse inhibition), and spatial learning and memory (Morris water maze, MWM). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging at 11.7T measured brain metabolism, CBF, and white and gray matter integrity in adult mice. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses evaluated inflammation, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and vascular density.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectCognitive and behavioral tests demonstrated increased locomotion in Phenotypers during puberty after flavanol supplementation (p = 0.041) but not in adulthood. Rotarod and prepulse inhibition demonstrated no differences in sensorimotor integration. Flavanols altered spatial learning in the MWM in adulthood (p = 0.039), while spatial memory remained unaffected. Additionally, flavanols increased diffusion coherence in the visual cortex (p = 0.014) and possibly the corpus callosum (p = 0.066) in adulthood. Mean diffusion remained unaffected, a finding that corresponds with our immunohistochemical data showing no effect on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and vascular density. However, flavanols decreased CBF in the cortex (p = 0.001) and thalamus (p = 0.009) in adulthood. Brain metabolite levels and neuroinflammation remained unaffected by flavanols.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectThese data suggest that dietary flavanols results in subtle alterations in brain structure, locomotor activity and spatial learning. Comparison of these data to published findings in aging or neurodegeneration suggests that benefits of dietary flavanols may increase with advancing age and in disease.Effect of perinatally supplemented flavonoids on brain structure, circulation, cognition, and metabolism in C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectShared penultimate authorship.Differential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectDifferential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectNeurons of chick auditory cortex analog (AuL) are susceptible to loud sound during developmentDifferential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectLoud noise exposure increased the excitatory/inhibitory component ratio in AuLDifferential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectUnaltered E/I ratio following loud music exposure holds true for the music characteristics and protocol usedDifferential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectLoud noise decreased the expression of synaptic stability proteins whereas loud music increased the expressionDifferential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectMolecular changes in AuL are governed by the physical properties of sound stimulusDifferential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectProper development of the auditory cortex depends on early acoustic experience that modulates the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) circuits. In the present social and occupational environment exposure to chronic loud sound in the form of occupational or recreational noise, is becoming inevitable. This could especially disrupt the functional auditory cortex development leading to altered processing of complex sound and hearing impairment. Here we report the effects of prenatal chronic loud sound (110-dB sound pressure level (SPL)) exposure (rhythmic [music] and arrhythmic [noise] forms) on the molecular components involved in regulation of the E/I balance in the developing auditory cortex analog/Field L (AuL) in domestic chicks. Noise exposure at 110-dB SPL significantly enhanced the E/I ratio (increased expression of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit and glutamate with decreased expression of GABA(A) receptor gamma 2 subunit and GABA), whereas loud music exposure maintained the E/I ratio. Expressions of markers of synaptogenesis, synaptic stability and plasticity i.e., synaptophysin, PSD-95 and gephyrin were reduced with noise but increased with music exposure. Thus our results showed differential effects of prenatal chronic loud noise and music exposures on the E/I balance and synaptic function and stability in the developing auditory cortex. Loud music exposure showed an overall enrichment effect whereas loud noise-induced significant alterations in E/I balance could later impact the auditory function and associated cognitive behavior.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectFractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectIn this study we investigated the neural processing of fractals.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectVisual hierarchies are efficiently represented using self-embedding rules.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectRule-based hierarchical processing recruits the visual dorsal stream.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectSelf-embedding rules additionally activate the parieto-medial temporal pathway.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectThis pathway integrates objects in contexts, and integrates “space” and “meaning”.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectHierarchical structures play a central role in many aspects of human cognition, prominently including both language and music. In this study we addressed hierarchy in the visual domain, using a novel paradigm based on fractal images. Fractals are self-similar patterns generated by repeating the same simple rule at multiple hierarchical levels. Our hypothesis was that the brain uses different resources for processing hierarchies depending on whether it applies a “fractal” or a “non-fractal” cognitive strategy. We analyzed the neural circuits activated by these complex hierarchical patterns in an event-related fMRI study of 40 healthy subjects.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectBrain activation was compared across three different tasks: a similarity task, and two hierarchical tasks in which subjects were asked to recognize the repetition of a rule operating transformations either within an existing hierarchical level, or generating new hierarchical levels. Similar hierarchical images were generated by both rules and target images were identical.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectWe found that when processing visual hierarchies, engagement in both hierarchical tasks activated the visual dorsal stream (occipito-parietal cortex, intraparietal sulcus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). In addition, the level-generating task specifically activated circuits related to the integration of spatial and categorical information, and with the integration of items in contexts (posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and medial, ventral and anterior regions of temporal cortex). These findings provide interesting new clues about the cognitive mechanisms involved in the generation of new hierarchical levels as required for fractals.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.What child is this? What interval was that? Familiar tunes and music perception in novice listeners - ScienceDirectIn the laboratory, musical novices often seem insensitive even to basic structural elements of music (octaves, intervals, etc.), undermining long-held theories of music perception, and threatening to leave current theories applicable only to experts. Consequently it is important to demonstrate novices' basic listening competence where possible. Two experiments examined the perception of musical intervals (minor thirds, major thirds and perfect fourths) by musical novices. Subjects received either standard instructions or familiar folk-tune labels to aid performance. The folk-tune labels greatly improved identification performance, producing expert-caliber performance by some musically inexperienced subjects. The effectiveness of the folk-tune manipulation was much more limited in a difficult discrimination task. The results suggest that novices do have some basic competence when assayed appropriately, and that familiar musical tokens may be a critical element in such assays. Larger implications of the role of familiarity in novices' competence are discussed, including those that relate to music cognition and aesthetics.What child is this? What interval was that? Familiar tunes and music perception in novice listeners - ScienceDirectWe thank Jenny Saffran for her assistance in the conduct of this research, and Larry Nelson who guided the production of all the stimulus materials.“From a Vibrant City to a Warzone”: Shostakovich’s 7th Symphony as a means to foster historical understanding through empathy - ScienceDirectScholars have long pointed to the power of music as a primary source in instruction for bringing past actors into sharper view and engender deeper connections with the past. By employing Dimitri Shostakovich's 7th Symphony, composed amidst the Nazi siege of Leningrad during the Second World War, we sought to explore, more precisely, the nature of how music, as a primary source, enhances the study of history among students. Through the formulation, execution, and assessment of a two-day lesson with students in five secondary history classes, three of which listened to the symphony and two of which did not, we found that the incorporation of the symphony resulted in students’ enhanced empathetic understanding of the past. Implications include details regarding profound opportunities for, as well as challenges to, cultivating historical empathy through the use of music as a primary source.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectSupplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectSupplementary motor area is involved in sequence processing.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectSMA regions play a domain-general role.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectSMA regions mediate integration of sequential elements into representations.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectSMA regions encode ordinal and temporal properties of a sequence.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectPre-SMA, rather than SMA-proper, is implicated in sequence operations.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectThe Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) is considered as an anatomically and functionally heterogeneous region and is implicated in several functions. We propose that SMA plays a crucial role in domain-general sequence processes, contributing to the integration of sequential elements into higher-order representations regardless of the nature of such elements (e.g., motor, temporal, spatial, numerical, linguistic, etc.).Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectThis review emphasizes the domain-general involvement of the SMA, as this region has been found to support sequence operations in a variety of cognitive domains that, albeit different, share an inherent sequence processing. These include action, time and spatial processing, numerical cognition, music and language processing, and working memory.Supplementary motor area as key structure for domain-general sequence processing: A unified account - ScienceDirectIn this light, we reviewed and synthesized recent neuroimaging, stimulation and electrophysiological studies in order to compare and reconcile the distinct sources of data by proposing a unifying account for the role of the SMA. We also discussed the differential contribution of the pre-SMA and SMA-proper in sequence operations, and possible neural mechanisms by which such operations are executed.Plasticity of the human auditory cortex related to musical training - ScienceDirectDuring the last decades music neuroscience has become a rapidly growing field within the area of neuroscience. Music is particularly well suited for studying neuronal plasticity in the human brain because musical training is more complex and multimodal than most other daily life activities, and because prospective and professional musicians usually pursue the training with high and long-lasting commitment. Therefore, music has increasingly been used as a tool for the investigation of human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Music relates to many brain functions like perception, action, cognition, emotion, learning and memory and therefore music is an ideal tool to investigate how the human brain is working and how different brain functions interact. Novel findings have been obtained in the field of induced cortical plasticity by musical training. The positive effects, which music in its various forms has in the healthy human brain are not only important in the framework of basic neuroscience, but they also will strongly affect the practices in neuro-rehabilitation.Plasticity of the human auditory cortex related to musical training - ScienceDirect► Musical training shapes the plasticity of the human auditory cortex. ► Music is valuable tool for investigating human cognition and brain mechanisms. ► This is important for basic neuroscience and neuro-rehabilitation.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectPeople with mental disorders use music for the reduction of negative emotions.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe preference of reflexive and complex music (classical music/jazz) is mostly preferred by people with personality disorders.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe preference of reflexive and complex music (classical music/jazz) is used less for fun stimulation than in healthy individuals.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectMusical preferences are linked to specific patterns of emotion modulation in mental disorders.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe knowledge of the role of music preferences has a special impact on music therapy and psychotherapy.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe objective of this study was to explore the relationship between the use of music in everyday life for the modulation of emotions and musical preferences, focussing on people with mental disorders. Musical preferences were assessed in the population of a psychiatric hospital according to different musical preference categories. The IAAM (inventory for the assessment of activation and arousal modulation through music) measured the situation-dependent use of music in everyday life. Data were compared to a healthy control population.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe results indicated that people with mental disorders used music for the reduction of emotions with negative valence. This was especially true for those individuals who preferred reflective and complex music (such as classical music). These participants primarily had diagnoses of personality disorders, and they used music less for fun than healthy comparators. Connections between musical preferences and emotional modulation patterns in the use of music in everyday life were much more differentiated in the general population than in the psychiatric cohort. Further studies on the basis of this empirical approach are warranted.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectActing professor at the International Psychoanalytic University Berlin, Germany.Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectLearning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectStudents increased their performance in most of the tasks associated with the FS2C framework.Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectSignificant increases in all groups occurred for the classifying and numerical proportional tasks.Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectSignificant increases occurred for the NS group in the ordering and measurement tasks.Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectSignificant increases occurred for the US group in the logical proportional and measurement tasks.Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectComparisons of objects seem to be beneficial when assisted by interactive features and visual aids.Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition - ScienceDirectSize and scale cognition is a critical aptitude associated with reasoning with concepts and systems in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, the teaching and learning of concepts related to size and scale present major challenges because objects at certain scales are unable to be perceived by humans with the naked eye. A potential way to overcome this challenge could be by means of learning strategies coupled with multimedia learning. In this study we propose learning strategies, instantiated by multimedia are for learning tools that may result in improved learning of size and scale cognition based on the FS2C framework. This framework consists of five levels to characterize size and scale cognition and the cognitive processes supporting them. Participants of this quasi-experimental design included 224 undergraduate students who experienced one of three different multimedia for learning tools, and then were assessed through five tasks whose design was based on the FS2C framework. Results suggest that learning strategies prompting students to compare objects of different sizes, may increase their abilities in ordering and classifying objects. Having students to interact with a logarithmic scale may also have increased participant posttest performance scores in the numerical proportional and absolute measurement tasks. Finally, we propose that the use of multimedia for learning affordances like 3D interaction, zoom in and zoom out, and direct interaction with a scale metaphor may help students make explicit connections and become familiar with objects of different sizes and scales.Posture and cognition in the elderly: Interaction and contribution to the rehabilitation strategies - ScienceDirectIn this paper we review the effects of aging on sensory systems and their impact on posture, balance and gait. We also address cognitive aging and attempt to specify which altered cognitive functions negatively impact balance and walking. The role of cognition in postural control is tested with dual-task experiments. This situation results in deleterious effects due to an attentional overload. Given the human cognitive system has limited capacities, we propose that simultaneously performing two tasks depends on the capacity of each individual to perform these tasks on a continuum between automatic execution to highly controlled performance. A level of maximum control exceeds the subject's attentional capacity, which makes it impossible to perform both tasks simultaneously. The subject therefore prioritizes one of the tasks. We use representative dual-task studies from the literature to illustrate the relationship between the different cognitive components and their impact on the control of posture and gait in elderly subjects with altered cognitive capacities and with elderly subjects who are fallers or who have altered sensory-motor capacities. Recently this postural-cognitive relationship was addressed with a new approach. We report how cognitive training can improve dual-task management and we attempt to define the cognitive mechanisms that may be responsible for better postural balance.Posture and cognition in the elderly: Interaction and contribution to the rehabilitation strategies - ScienceDirectDans cet article, nous passons en revue les effets du vieillissement sur les systèmes sensoriels et leurs conséquences sur les performances de posture, d’équilibration et de marche. Nous abordons également le vieillissement cognitif et tentons de préciser, parmi les fonctions cognitives altérées, celles qui peuvent participer à la détérioration de l’équilibre et de la marche. L’implication cognitive dans le contrôle postural est traitée par l’approche expérimentale des double-tâches posturo-cognitives. Cette situation présente un effet délétère du fait du surcoût attentionnel. Le système cognitif humain ayant des capacités limitées, nous proposons que la réalisation simultanée de deux tâches dépend de la capacité de chaque sujet de réaliser ces tâches selon un continuum compris entre une réalisation automatique jusqu’à une réalisation hautement contrôlée. Un niveau de contrôle maximal dépasse les capacités attentionnelles du sujet rendant la réalisation simultanée de ces deux tâches impossibles. Le sujet priorise alors une des deux tâches. Parmi la vaste littérature sur les double-tâches, nous décrirons ici des travaux représentatifs des relations entre différentes composantes cognitives et leurs conséquences sur le contrôle de la posture et de la marche, au cours du vieillissement, chez des sujets chuteurs ou dont les capacités sensorimotrices sont altérées, et chez des personnes dont les capacités cognitives sont altérées. Récemment, cette relation posture-cognition a été envisagée de façon nouvelle. Nous décrivons ici comment un entraînement cognitif est capable de favoriser une meilleure gestion de la double-tâche et tentons de préciser les mécanismes cognitifs qui seraient responsables d’un meilleur équilibre postural.Techniques and devices to restore cognition - ScienceDirectExecutive planning, the ability to direct and sustain attention, language and several types of memory may be compromised by conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, cancer, autism, cerebral palsy and Alzheimer's disease. No medical devices are currently available to help restore these cognitive functions. Recent findings about the neurophysiology of these conditions in humans coupled with progress in engineering devices to treat refractory neurological conditions imply that the time has arrived to consider the design and evaluation of a new class of devices. Like their neuromotor counterparts, neurocognitive prostheses might sense or modulate neural function in a non-invasive manner or by means of implanted electrodes. In order to paint a vision for future device development, it is essential to first review what can be achieved using behavioral and external modulatory techniques. While non-invasive approaches might strengthen a patient's remaining intact cognitive abilities, neurocognitive prosthetics comprised of direct brain–computer interfaces could in theory physically reconstitute and augment the substrate of cognition itself.Cortical Systems Associated with Covert Music Rehearsal - ScienceDirectMusicalrepresentation and overt music production are necessarily complex cognitive phenomena. While overt musical performance may be observed and studied, the act of performance itself necessarily skews results toward the importance of primary sensorimotor and auditory cortices. However, imagined musical performance (IMP) represents a complex behavioral task involving components suited to exploring the physiological underpinnings of musical cognition in music performance without the sensorimotor and auditory confounds of overt performance. We mapped the blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI activation response associated with IMP in experienced musicians independent of the piece imagined. IMP consistently activated supplementary motor and premotor areas, right superior parietal lobule, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral mid-frontal gyri, and bilateral lateral cerebellum in contrast with rest, in a manner distinct from fingertapping versus rest and passive listening to the same piece versus rest. These data implicate an associative network independent of primary sensorimotor and auditory activity, likely representing the cortical elements most intimately linked to music production.Cortical Systems Associated with Covert Music Rehearsal - ScienceDirectTo whom correspondence should be addressed.

This article looks more closely into the patterning of verbs of cognition with different kinds of subjects in Finnish conversation. Based on a morphosyntactically coded database of conversational Finnish, I show that there are several recurring patterns with verbs of cognition which can be viewed as “emergent discourse patterns” (cf. Scheibman, 2002) or prefabs (Bybee, 2006). The analysis suggests that crystallization of recurrent patterns does in fact occur; this crystallization, however, shows features that are specific to individual verbs and types of subject (zero vs. pronominal vs. full NP). Also relevant are polarity and tense. It is shown that the components of these prefabs retain associations with other occurrences of the lexical elements of the components. Furthermore, the prefabs are associated with the more general constructions from which they arose. Thus, the patterns in question are based on regular grammatical processes such as agreement, but at the same time, exhibit certain features of crystallization.Music genre classification based on local feature selection using a self-adaptive harmony search algorithm - ScienceDirectThis paper proposes an automatic music genre-classification system based on a local feature-selection strategy by using a self-adaptive harmony search (SAHS) algorithm. First, five acoustic characteristics (i.e., intensity, pitch, timbre, tonality, and rhythm) are extracted to generate an original feature set. A feature-selection model using the SAHS algorithm is then employed for each pair of genres, thereby deriving the corresponding local feature set. Finally, each one-against-one support vector machine (SVM) classifier is fed with the corresponding local feature set, and the majority voting method is used to classify each musical recording. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset were conducted, demonstrating that our method is effective. The results show that the local-selection strategies using wrapper and filter approaches ranked first and third in performance among all relevant methods.Music genre classification based on local feature selection using a self-adaptive harmony search algorithm - ScienceDirectYin-Fu Huang received the B.S. degree in computer science from National Chiao-Tung University in 1979, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from National Tsing-Hua University in 1984 and 1988, respectively.

Agitation results when this stress threshold is exceeded. A proposed mid-range theory incorporates these elements to discuss the use of individualized music to alleviate agitation. Music may provide a method of communicating with this population even in advanced stages when the person is unable to understand verbal language and has decreased ability to interpret environmental stimuli. It is predicted that the presentation of music carefully selected for meaningfulness to the person during his or her younger years will stimulate memory for remote events, and elicitation of memories associated with positive feelings will have a soothing effect and will alleviate or decrease agitated behaviors. Results from a pilot study and preliminary findings from a study currently underway are provided as beginning efforts to support this mid-range theory. An individualized music intervention that flows from this mid-range theory is discussed.An individualized music intervention for agitation - ScienceDirectSupported in part by a grant from the National Institute for Nursing Research F31 NRO7090-01, the 1996–1997 American Association of Retired Persons Andrus Foundation Fellowship in Gerontology, and a grant from the University of Iowa Student Government.An individualized music intervention for agitation - ScienceDirectLinda Gerdner is a doctoral student in the College of Nursing at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectMusic to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectTwo studies explored musical imagery in the lab and in daily life.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectThe experience of musicians and non-musicians was compared.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectPersonality, musical preference, and positive mood predicted imagery.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectIndividual differences predicted intentional control of imagery.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectResults support the view of imagery as positive and non-intrusive.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectIn two studies, we explored the frequency and phenomenology of musical imagery. Study 1 used retrospective reports of musical imagery to assess the contribution of individual differences to imagery characteristics. Study 2 used an experience sampling design to assess the phenomenology of musical imagery over the course of one week in a sample of musicians and non-musicians. Both studies found episodes of musical imagery to be common and positive: people rarely wanted such experiences to end and often heard music that was personally meaningful. Several variables predicted musical imagery, including personality, musical preferences, and positive mood. Musicians tended to hear musical imagery more often, but they reported less frequent episodes of deliberately-generated imagery. Taken together, the present research provides new insights into individual differences in musical imagery, and it supports the emerging view that such experiences are common, positive, and more voluntary than previously recognized.Cognitive vs. affective listening modes and judgments of music – An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe neural correlates of processing deviations from Western music rules are relatively well known. Less is known of the neural dynamics of top-down listening modes and affective liking judgments in relation with judgments of tonal correctness. In this study, subjects determined if tonal chord sequences sounded correct or incorrect, or if they liked them or not, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured. The last chord of the sequences could be congruous with the previous context, ambiguous (unusual but still enjoyable) or harmonically inappropriate. The cognitive vs. affective listening modes were differentiated in the event-related potential (ERP) responses already before the ending chord, indicating different preparation for the judgment tasks. Furthermore, three neural events tagged the decision process preceding the behavioral responses. First, an early negativity, peaking at about 280 ms, was elicited by chord incorrectness and by disliking judgments only over the right hemisphere. Second, at about 500 ms from the end of the sequence a positive brain response was elicited by the negative answers of both tasks. Third, at about 1200 ms, a late positive potential (LPP) was elicited by the liking judgment task whereas a large negative brain response was elicited by the correctness judgment task, indexing that only at that late latency preceding the button press subjects decided how to judge the cadences. This is the first study to reveal the dissociation between neural processes occurring during affective vs. cognitive listening modes and judgments of music.Cognitive vs. affective listening modes and judgments of music – An ERP study - ScienceDirect▶ Enhanced negative waves preceding correctness judgments. ▶ After ending chord early negative and late positive brain waves to negative judgments. ▶ At very late latencies neural processes underlying liking and correctness judgments diverged. ▶ Affective strategies were employed for liking decisions. ▶ Memory integration mechanisms lead to correctness decisions.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectMaking the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectSports relevant frequency and time-domain EEG studies are reviewed.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectEfficacy of neurofeedback for performance enhancement is assessed.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectKey findings are outlined; limitations are identified and discussed.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectImportance of mobile EEG for future research in sport is highlighted.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectIn the high stakes world of International sport even the smallest change in performance can make the difference between success and failure, leading sports professionals to become increasingly interested in the potential benefits of neuroimaging. Here we describe evidence from EEG studies that either identify neural signals associated with expertise in sport, or employ neurofeedback to improve performance. Evidence for the validity of neurofeedback as a technique for enhancing sports performance remains limited. By contrast, progress in characterizing the neural correlates of sporting behavior is clear: frequency domain studies link expert performance to changes in alpha rhythms, whilst time-domain studies link expertise in response evaluation and motor output with modulations of P300 effects and readiness potentials. Despite early promise, however, findings have had relatively little impact for sports professionals, at least in part because there has been a mismatch between lab tasks and real sporting activity. After selectively reviewing existing findings and outlining limitations, we highlight developments in mobile EEG technology that offer new opportunities for sports neuroscience.What is specific to music processing? Insights from congenital amusia - ScienceDirectMusical abilities are generally regarded as an evolutionary by-product of more important functions, such as those involved in language. However, there is increasing evidence that humans are born with musical predispositions that develop spontaneously into sophisticated knowledge bases and procedures that are unique to music. Recent findings also suggest that the brain is equipped with music-specific neural networks and that these can be selectively compromised by a congenital anomaly. This results in a disorder, congenital amusia, that appears to be limited to the processing of music. Recent evidence points to fine-grained perception of pitch as the root of musical handicap. Hence, musical abilities appear to depend crucially on the fine-tuning of pitch, in much the same way that language abilities rely on fine time resolution.Symptoms of schizophrenia and social cognition - ScienceDirectThis study investigated the relationship between deficits in social cognition and the dimensional descriptors for schizophrenia. Social cognitive functioning was measured using patient narratives describing card arrangements using the picture arrangement subtest of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised. Stories were rated for number of normative themes, number of words, coherence, plausibility of attributions of emotions, and plausibility of attributions of intentions. Symptoms of Psychoticism were positively related to all ratings except of the plausibility of attributions of intentions. Ratings of story coherence, number of normative ideas, plausibility of attributions of intentions, and plausibility of attributions of emotions were negatively related to symptoms of disorganization. There was a negative relationship between negative symptoms and all rating categories except story coherence. Results indicate that it could be productive to attempt to tailor psychosocial interventions to the dominant symptom picture of patients with schizophrenia in order to improve aspects of social cognitive functioning.An empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music - ScienceDirectMusicologists and linguists have often suggested that the prosody of a culture's spoken language can influence the structure of its instrumental music. However, empirical data supporting this idea have been lacking. This has been partly due to the difficulty of developing and applying comparable quantitative measures to melody and rhythm in speech and music. This study uses a recently-developed measure for the study of speech rhythm to compare rhythmic patterns in English and French language and classical music. We find that English and French musical themes are significantly different in this measure of rhythm, which also differentiates the rhythm of spoken English and French. Thus, there is an empirical basis for the claim that spoken prosody leaves an imprint on the music of a culture.State of the art on targeted memory reactivation: Sleep your way to enhanced cognition - ScienceDirectTargeted memory reactivation is a fairly simple technique that has the potential to influence the course of memory formation through application of cues during sleep. Studies have shown that cueing memory during sleep can lead to either an enhanced or decreased representation of the information encoded in the targeted networks, depending on experimental variations. The effects have been associated with sleep parameters and accompanied by activation of memory related brain areas. The findings suggest a causal role of neuronal replay in memory consolidation and provide evidence for the active system consolidation hypothesis. However, the observed inconsistencies across studies suggest that further research is warranted regarding the underlying neural mechanisms and optimal conditions for the application of targeted memory reactivation. The goal of the present review is to integrate the currently available experimental data and to provide an overview of this technique's limitations and pitfalls, as well as its potential applications in everyday use and clinical treatment. Exploring the open questions herein identified should lead to insight into safer and more effective ways of adjusting memory representations to better suit individual needs.State of the art on targeted memory reactivation: Sleep your way to enhanced cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this paper.The intrinsic link between motor behavior and temporal cognition - ScienceDirectThe debate about the cognitive mechanisms behind human temporal processing has raged for decades without a clear resolution. The theory presented here describes a different perspective to the traditional accounts on the issue, namely, that motor behaviors or sequences of motor behaviors provide a means of reproducing time intervals. Evidence behind this perspective includes tapping strategies (exemplified by musicians), counting strategies, and neuropsychological results showing activation of motor areas during temporal cognitive tasks. I propose that motor behaviors aid human timing by offering a set of processes that consistently take a set amount of time to accomplish. Motor behaviors also allow segmentation of larger intervals into smaller intervals that are easier to estimate. I conclude with a discussion of implications of this perspective on temporal cognition.Social Cognition and the Evolution of Language: Constructing Cognitive Phylogenies - ScienceDirectHuman language and social cognition are closely linked: advanced social cognition is necessary for children to acquire language, and language allows forms of social understanding (and, more broadly, culture) that would otherwise be impossible. Both “language” and “social cognition” are complex constructs, involving many independent cognitive mechanisms, and the comparative approach provides a powerful route to understanding the evolution of such mechanisms. We provide a broad comparative review of mechanisms underlying social intelligence in vertebrates, with the goal of determining which human mechanisms are broadly shared, which have evolved in parallel in other clades, and which, potentially, are uniquely developed in our species. We emphasize the importance of convergent evolution for testing hypotheses about neural mechanisms and their evolution.Need for cognition and false memory in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm - ScienceDirectTwo experiments investigated whether false recognition in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm is mediated by individual differences in need for cognition. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with word lists composed of associates which converge on a non-presented critical word. On a subsequent recognition test, high need for cognition participants falsely recognized a greater proportion of critical words as having been previously studied than did low need for cognition participants. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, and also tested a manipulation of list strength. Word lists used were either strong or weak in terms of eliciting the critical item. These experiments show that individual differences in approach to information processing tasks can affect the rate of false memory elicited in the DRM task.Popular music, identity, and sexualization: A latent class analysis of artist types - ScienceDirectA key ingredient of the production of popular music involves making decisions about the distinct character type of a particular artist. But there is a dearth of scientific studies that empirically examine artist images in a macro context, thus the range of gendered and sexualized artist types available in the marketplace is only known through interpretive studies contextually confined in scope. After collecting descriptive information on a sample of highly promoted artists played at least one time on monitored radio stations in an 18-month period (417 female and 1943 male popular music artists), I offer an empirical description of gendered, raced and sexualized artist types using Latent Class Analysis. I find 10 male types (Soul Singer, Leader, Romantic Singer-Songwriters, Thugs, Anti-Heroes, Absurd Extremists, Sophisticated Singer-Songwriters, Emotypes, Summer Party Jammers, and Others) and 6 female types (Femme Fatales, Models of Femininity, Pop Princesses, Chanteuse Singer-Songwriters, Underground Feminists, and Others). Suggestions for future research are given.Popular music, identity, and sexualization: A latent class analysis of artist types - ScienceDirectPatti Lynne Donze is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

However, the mechanisms by which music modulates the neural activity associated with learning and memory remain largely unexplored. We evaluated coherent frontal oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while subjects were engaged in a modified version of Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Subjects heard either a spoken version of the AVLT or the conventional AVLT word list sung. Learning-related changes in coherence (LRCC) were measured by comparing the EEG during word encoding on correctly recalled trials to the immediately preceding trial on which the same word was not recalled. There were no significant changes in coherence associated with conventional verbal learning. However, musical verbal learning was associated with increased coherence within and between left and right frontal areas in theta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands. It is unlikely that the different patterns of LRCC reflect general performance differences; the groups exhibited similar learning performance. The results suggest that verbal learning with a musical template strengthens coherent oscillations in frontal cortical networks involved in verbal encoding.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectListening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectWe used rewarding choruses of popular songs to examine the neural correlates of reward processing.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectThe verse was followed by either the chorus or noise.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectLateralized temporoparietal activations during reward-gain and reward-loss were observed.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectLeft-biased lateral orbitofrontal activation during reward-anticipation.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectThe medial orbitofrontal cortex was activated during reward-gain.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectArtificial rewards, such as visual arts and music, produce pleasurable feelings. Popular songs in the verse-chorus form provide a useful model for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of artificial rewards, because the chorus is usually the most rewarding element of a song. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, the stimuli were excerpts of 10 popular songs with a tensioned verse-to-chorus transition. We examined the neural correlates of three phases of reward processing: (1) reward-anticipation during the verse-to-chorus transition, (2) reward-gain during the first phrase of the chorus, and (3) reward-loss during the unexpected noise followed by the verse-to-chorus transition. Participants listened to these excerpts in a risk-reward context because the verse was followed by either the chorus or noise with equal probability. The results showed that reward-gain and reward-loss were associated with left- and right-biased temporoparietal junction activation, respectively. The bilateral temporoparietal junctions were active during reward-anticipation. Moreover, we observed left-biased lateral orbitofrontal activation during reward-anticipation, whereas the medial orbitofrontal cortex was activated during reward-gain. The findings are discussed in relation to the cognitive and emotional aspects of reward processing.Do dopaminergic gene polymorphisms affect mesolimbic reward activation of music listening response? Therapeutic impact on Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) - ScienceDirectUsing fMRI, Menon and Levitin [9] clearly found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Importantly, responses in the NAc and VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Listing to pleasant music induced a strong response and significant activation of the VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Blum et al. [10] provided the first evidence that the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) Taq 1 A1 allele significantly associated with severe alcoholism whereby the author’s suggested that they found the first “reward gene” located in the mesolimbic system. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences. However, little is known about why some people have a more or less powerful mesolimbic experience when they are listening to music. It is well-known that music may induce an endorphinergic response that is blocked by naloxone, a known opioid antagonist (Goldstein [19]). Opioid transmission in the NAc is associated with dopamine release in the VTA. Moreover, dopamine release in the VTA is linked to polymorphisms of the DRD2 gene and even attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whereby carriers of the DRD2 A1 allele show a reduced NAc release of dopamine (DA). Thus it is conjectured that similar mechanisms in terms of adequate dopamine release and subsequent activation of reward circuitry by listening to music might also be affected by an individual’s D2 density in the VTA mediated interaction of the NAc. It is therefore hypothesized that carriers of DRD2 A1 allele may respond significantly differently to carriers of the DRD2 A2 genotype. In this regard, carriers of the D2 A1 allele have a blunted response to glucose and monetary rewards. In contrast powerful D2 agonists like bromocryptine show a heightened activation of the reward circuitry only in DRD2 A1 allele carriers. If music causes a powerful activation in spite of the DRD2 A1 allele due to a strong DA neuronal release which subsequently impinges on existing D2 receptors, then it is reasonable to assume that music is a strong indirect D2 agonist (by virtue of DA neuronal release in the NAc) and may have important therapeutic applicability in Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) related behaviors including Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Ross et al. [18] found that music therapy appears to be a novel motivational tool in a severely impaired inpatient sample of patients with co-occurring mental illness and addiction.Music: From shiver to functional cerebral processes and rehabilitation? - ScienceDirectMusic is a multifaceted psychological phenomenon and we experience music's propensity to trigger memories, movements, and emotions. Input through auditory system is a temporal processing “expert” in the brain, and allows relationships between communication, cognition and sensorimotor processes. Inverse models hold an important role in sound perception as well, as they allow to predict and simulate the physical aspects of motion and space implied in the music. Forward internal models represent an information flow from action to perception, in the sense that they allow the prediction of the likely sensory outcome of a planned or executed action [1]. Furthermore, sound involvement in action, cognitive studies showed that musicians present augmented ability in different forms of visual attention [2] and various cognitive processes. So music and sound stimuli supplies an excellent framework to study the effects of uni- versus multimodal approaches. Humans are extremely good at detecting anomalies in sensory input. Several studies have shown that motor dysfunction leads to considerable changes in individuals’ perception and recognition of auditory and musical features. In a restorative approach, many studies have suggested that structural and functional cerebral neuroplastic processes result from musical training. Auditory experience, through modulation and amplification of associated stimuli, and software-based training affect affects functional abilities.Music: From shiver to functional cerebral processes and rehabilitation? - ScienceDirectWe investigated how contextual and non-contextual auditory stimuli influence the performance of brain-injured patients in a navigational task (VAPS virtual supermarket). Patients’ responses to auditory stimuli are heterogeneous, which is consistent with the complexity of processes involved in navigation. Results suggest that additional stimuli may be helpful in the neurorehabilitation of brain-damaged patients with executive disorders. Patients with localization deficit or auditory neglect still benefited from auditory contextual cues. A greater knowledge of these processes may allow selecting patients for whom rehabilitation with auditory stimuli would be helpful and defining appropriate training.Similar cerebral networks in language, music and song perception - ScienceDirectTwo fMRI experiments were conducted using song to investigate the domain specificity of linguistic and musical processing. In Experiment 1, participants listened to pairs of spoken words, “vocalise” (i.e., singing without words), and sung words while performing a same-different task. Results revealed bilateral involvement of middle and superior temporal gyri and inferior and middle frontal gyri while listening to spoken words, sung words and vocalise, although to different degrees. In Experiment 2, participants listened to pairs of sung words that were similar or different in terms of the linguistic and musical dimensions (2 × 2 factorial event-related design) while performing a same-different task. Results showed widespread interactions between the linguistic and musical dimensions of sung words mainly within the network of brain areas identified in Experiment 1. Consequently, the activity in these brain regions cannot be considered as specific to either language or music processing. Taken together, results of both experiments argue against domain specificity and provide additional evidence for a common cerebral network involved in both lexical/phonological and melodic processing.Early auditory enrichment with music enhances auditory discrimination learning and alters NR2B protein expression in rat auditory cortex - ScienceDirectPrevious studies have shown that the functional development of auditory system is substantially influenced by the structure of environmental acoustic inputs in early life. In our present study, we investigated the effects of early auditory enrichment with music on rat auditory discrimination learning. We found that early auditory enrichment with music from postnatal day (PND) 14 enhanced learning ability in auditory signal-detection task and in sound duration-discrimination task. In parallel, a significant increase was noted in NMDA receptor subunit NR2B protein expression in the auditory cortex. Furthermore, we found that auditory enrichment with music starting from PND 28 or 56 did not influence NR2B expression in the auditory cortex. No difference was found in the NR2B expression in the inferior colliculus (IC) between music-exposed and normal rats, regardless of when the auditory enrichment with music was initiated. Our findings suggest that early auditory enrichment with music influences NMDA-mediated neural plasticity, which results in enhanced auditory discrimination learning.Early auditory enrichment with music enhances auditory discrimination learning and alters NR2B protein expression in rat auditory cortex - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Phase synchrony analysis of EEG during music perception reveals changes in functional connectivity due to musical expertise - ScienceDirectDifferences in functional and topographical connectivity patterns between two groups, musicians and non-musicians, during attentively listening to three different pieces of music and to a text of neutral content, were presented by means of EEG phase synchrony analysis in five standard frequency bands: delta (<4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), and gamma (>30 Hz). The degree of phase synchrony or phase coherence between EEG signals was measured by a recently developed index, which is more suitable than classical indices, like correlation or coherence, when dealing with nonlinear and nonstationary signals like EEG. Comparing the music listening task to rest or control condition, musicians showed increase in phase synchrony over distributed cortical areas, both near and distant, in delta, and most conspicuously in gamma frequency band, whereas non-musicians showed enhancement only in delta band. Further, the degree of phase synchrony in musicians was reduced during listening to text as compared to listening to music. Comparing the two groups during the listening tasks, the clear-cut difference was found in gamma band phase synchrony, which was significantly stronger in musicians while listening to every chosen piece of music, yet no large difference between these two groups was found while listening to the chosen text. Musicians also showed stronger higher order inter-frequency phase synchrony between delta band oscillations in anterior regions and gamma band oscillations in posterior regions. In addition, consistent left hemispheric dominance, in terms of the strength of phase synchrony, was observed in musicians while listening to music, whereas right hemispheric dominance was observed in non-musicians. These results suggest that professional training in music is able to elicit context-sensitive functional connectivity between multiple cortical regions resulting in different listening strategies to music.The concept of meaning: The key to clarify the human cognition and psychopathology - ScienceDirectMeaning is a concept which is discussed everywhere. Besides being a common word, it is relevant for cognitive and linguistic studies. Nevertheless, translation problems and the specific definition of similar concepts by different disciplines hamper the discussion. In this paper, the authors discard some popular ideas about meaning (as being an image, an object or the relationship between signs), and highlights its relation with intentions, and the new concept of “embodied meaning”. Following a suggestion by Timothy Crow, who studied schizophrenia and brain lateralization, the authors conclude that the right hemisphere (in right handed people) processes intentions and meanings, whereas the left hemisphere processes the signifier part of signs, including words, and their relationship to each other (the sense). This vision can elucidate some problems of Psychopathology and Philosophy of Mind.Impact of Group-Singing on Older Adult Health in Senior Living Communities: A Pilot Study - ScienceDirectParticipating in a group-singing program may be beneficial to healthy aging through engaging in active music-making activities and breathing exercises. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a 12-week group singing program on cognitive function, lung health and quality of life (QoL) of older adults.Impact of Group-Singing on Older Adult Health in Senior Living Communities: A Pilot Study - ScienceDirectA pre and post-test quasi-experimental design evaluated the impact of a group-singing program on older adult health. The intervention consisted of pre-singing exercises, song-singing and learning, and socialization. Classes were 75 minutes/week for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were age ≥60, no self-reported diagnosis of dementia, and able to hear conversations within 2 feet. Participants were recruited from 3 senior living communities. Outcome measures included cognition, lung function, QoL, and program feasibility and acceptability. A paired t-test with 2-sided alpha level at 0.05 was used to test the null hypotheses.Impact of Group-Singing on Older Adult Health in Senior Living Communities: A Pilot Study - ScienceDirectWe enrolled 49 participants (mean age 83.6). Forty-two (86%) completed the posttests and exit survey. At the 12th week there was significant improvement in phonological (p < 0.0001) and animal (p = 0.0004) semantic Verbal Fluency Tests, immediate Word Recall Test (p < 0.0001), Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (p = 0.0001), Maximum Expiratory Pressure (p < 0.0001), and in-session oxygen saturation (p = 0.03). Program satisfaction was rated, on average, 9 on a 10-point scale.Impact of Group-Singing on Older Adult Health in Senior Living Communities: A Pilot Study - ScienceDirectA group-singing program with deep breathing training and song-learning may promote memory, language, speech information processing, executive function, and respiratory muscle strength in older adults. The program was feasible and well-accepted. A clinical trial with a larger sample is indicated.Circadian rhythms and cognition - ScienceDirectLike all circadian (near-24-h) rhythms, those of cognition have endogenous and exogenous components. The origins of these components, together with effects of time awake upon cognitive performance, are described in subjects living conventionally (sleeping at night and active during the daytime). Based on these considerations, predictions can be made about changes that might be expected in the days after a time-zone transition and during night work. The relevant literature on these circumstances is then reviewed. The last section of the chapter deals with sleep-wake schedules where both regular and irregular sleeps are taken (anchor sleep).Rhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectRhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectRhythmic entrainment represents an affect induction mechanism.Rhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectRhythmic entrainment occurs on the perceptual, autonomic, motor, and social level.Rhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectThe basal ganglia play a key role in the link of rhythmic entrainment and affect.Rhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectRhythmic entrainment supposedly induces positive valence and social dispositions.Rhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectOne especially important feature of metrical music is that it contains periodicities that listeners’ bodily rhythms can adapt to. Recent psychological frameworks have introduced the notion of rhythmic entrainment, among other mechanisms, as an emotion induction principle. In this review paper, we discuss rhythmic entrainment as an affect induction mechanism by differentiating four levels of entrainment in humans—perceptual, autonomic physiological, motor, and social—all of which could contribute to a subjective feeling component. We review the theoretical and empirical literature on rhythmic entrainment to music that supports the existence of these different levels of entrainment by describing the phenomena and characterizing the associated underlying brain processes. The goal of this review is to present the theoretical implications and empirical findings about rhythmic entrainment as an important principle at the basis of affect induction via music, since it rests upon the temporal dimension of music, which is a specificity of music as an affective stimulus.Rhythmic entrainment as a musical affect induction mechanism - ScienceDirectBoth authors have contributed equally to this article.Straddling the humanities and social sciences: The research process of music scholars - ScienceDirectFew research projects have focused on the information needs of the music scholar. What is known about the information needs of the music scholar has been gathered through large-scale studies of various humanistic disciplines. This article describes a six-stage model of the music scholar’s research process. The model was constructed contextually through interviews with 30 music scholars who were asked to describe a recently completed research project. Research activities pertaining to specific stages in the research process are identified and described. This study compares existing models of the research process of other humanities scholars and explores the implications for library and information science professionals.Music reduces sensation and distress of labor pain - ScienceDirectLabor pain is often severe, and analgesic medication may not be indicated. In this randomized controlled trial we examined the effects of music on sensation and distress of pain in Thai primiparous women during the active phase of labor. The gate control theory of pain was the theoretical framework for this study. Randomization with a computerized minimization program was used to assign women to a music group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 55). Women in the intervention group listened to soft music without lyrics for 3 hours starting early in the active phase of labor. Dual visual analog scales were used to measure sensation and distress of pain before starting the study and at three hourly posttests. While controlling for pretest scores, one-way repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that those in the music group had significantly less sensation and distress of pain than did the control group (F (1, 107) = 18.69, p < .001, effect size = .15, and F (1, 107) = 14.87, p < .001, effect size = .12), respectively. Sensation and distress significantly increased across the 3 hours in both groups (p < .001), except for distress in the music group during the first hour. Distress was significantly lower than sensation in both groups (p < .05). In this controlled study, music—a mild to moderate strength intervention—consistently provided significant relief of severe pain across 3 hours of labor and delayed the increase of affective pain for 1 hour. Nurses can provide soft music to laboring women for greater pain relief during the active phase when contractions are strong and women suffer.Music reduces sensation and distress of labor pain - ScienceDirectWe acknowledge the support of the Alpha Mu Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau and the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing Alumni Association, Case Western Reserve University.Generalized problematic Internet use and regulation of social emotional competence: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitions arising from academic expectation stress on adolescents - ScienceDirectGeneralized problematic Internet use and regulation of social emotional competence: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitions arising from academic expectation stress on adolescents - ScienceDirectRegulatory social-emotional competence corresponded with more negative mood affect.Generalized problematic Internet use and regulation of social emotional competence: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitions arising from academic expectation stress on adolescents - ScienceDirectSocial-emotional competence corresponded with higher social control and withdrawal in GPIU.Generalized problematic Internet use and regulation of social emotional competence: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitions arising from academic expectation stress on adolescents - ScienceDirectSocio-emotional competence is associated with lower social benefits in GPIU.Generalized problematic Internet use and regulation of social emotional competence: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitions arising from academic expectation stress on adolescents - ScienceDirectMaladaptive cognitions mediated regulatory competence on five GPIU dimensions.Generalized problematic Internet use and regulation of social emotional competence: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitions arising from academic expectation stress on adolescents - ScienceDirectThis study explored the relationships between adolescents’ perceptions of their capacity for social-emotional regulation and generalized problematic Internet use (GPIU). It further examined if maladaptive thoughts from undue academic-related stress mediated this relationship in a school-going population in Singapore where educational achievement is heavily emphasized and expected from the family and school, and the pressure to succeed and do well academically is more acutely felt than that experienced in western contexts. A total of 1437 8th and 9th graders participated in a survey questionnaire. The results showed that adolescents who perceived higher regulatory competence were more likely to use the Internet to deal with the negative consequences of Internet use in appropriate ways. Also, the study found maladaptive thoughts that came from perceived academic expectations of parents and teachers partially mediated the effects of social-emotional regulatory competence and these youngsters’ ability to control their online social interactions. Of interest was the unexpected finding that the respective relationships between social-emotional regulatory competence and compulsive Internet use, and withdrawal from Internet use became salient when such maladaptive thoughts were taken into account, suggesting the possibility of suppression rather than mediational effects. Implications arising from the study will be discussed.Sleep–wake changes and cognition in neurodegenerative disease - ScienceDirectWith the increasing aging population, neurodegenerative disorders will become more common in clinical practice. These disorders involve multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that differentially affect cognition, mood, and physical functions. Possibly due to the involvement of common underlying neurobiological circuits, sleep and/or circadian (sleep–wake) changes are also common in this disease group. Of significance, sleep–wake changes are often a prodromal feature and are predictive of cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, need for institutional care, and caregiver burden. Unfortunately, in neurodegenerative disease, few studies have included detailed polysomnography or neuropsychological assessments although some data indicate that sleep and neurocognitive features are related. Further studies are also required to address the effects of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments on cognitive functioning. Such research will hopefully lead to targeted early intervention approaches for cognitive decline in older people.The living organism: Strengthening the basis - ScienceDirectIn spite of the considerable amount of literature dedicated to the living organism, it retains its mysteries. One of the most discussed aspects nowadays is whether the term “cognition” can be attributed to all classes of organisms, or whether it only refers to a metaphoric use of one human reality. Our approach consists of retaining the term “cognition” and making it a technical term, in order to propose a generic model. In this way, cognition becomes what finally characterises an organism as an autonomous agent. This perspective eliminates some misplaced questions, and helps to reframe old ones. The cognitive dimension can be apprehended indirectly only through its appearances. These direct us towards a modular model of cognition and orientate research towards the clarification of specific modules for each class of organisms.Better movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectBetter movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectFirst study of its kind within an educational setting in Scotland.Better movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectPre-, Post-, and 6 month follow-up testing.Better movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectPotential to inform educational policy and curriculum design.Better movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectEvaluates links between physical activity, coordination and cognition.Better movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectThis study will extend on a pilot study and will evaluate the impact of a novel approach to PE, Better Movers and Thinkers (BMT), on students' cognition, physical activity habits, and gross motor coordination (GMC).Better movers and thinkers (BMT): A quasi-experimental study into the impact of physical education on children's cognition—A study protocol - ScienceDirectThe study will involve six mainstream state schools with students aged 9–11 years.

The purpose of this randomised controlled pilot study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of MACT on attention outcomes for youth in secure residential care. Because of the generally low treatment motivation of this population, a non-standardised music therapy intervention (NSMT) with similar goals was included to determine if attendance and effects varied between a standardised and non-standardised intervention. Participants (n = 6) were randomly assigned to MACT, NSMT or a control group (TAU). Both MACT- and NSMT-participants followed a six-week program of once-a-week-music therapy sessions of 45 min. Outcomes in selective, focused, sustained and alternating attention were measured using the Trail Making Test A + B and the WISC-III Digit Span Forward and Backward, which were assessed at baseline and then at six and nine weeks. Results showed that both the interventions and the means of measurement were feasible in this population with an overall attendance rate of 97%. While attention outcomes varied with individual participants, the results demonstrate positive trends wherein more extensive research is necessary to further evaluate the effects.High resolution 1H NMR-based metabonomic study of the auditory cortex analogue of developing chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) following prenatal chronic loud music and noise exposure - ScienceDirectHigh resolution 1H NMR-based metabonomic study of the auditory cortex analogue of developing chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) following prenatal chronic loud music and noise exposure - ScienceDirectPrenatal chronic loud sound alters metabolic profile in chick auditory cortex analogue (AuL).High resolution 1H NMR-based metabonomic study of the auditory cortex analogue of developing chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) following prenatal chronic loud music and noise exposure - ScienceDirectChronic loud music and noise exposure reduces the levels of energy metabolites.High resolution 1H NMR-based metabonomic study of the auditory cortex analogue of developing chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) following prenatal chronic loud music and noise exposure - ScienceDirectLoud noise exposure reduces the levels of neuromodulators but not the music.High resolution 1H NMR-based metabonomic study of the auditory cortex analogue of developing chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) following prenatal chronic loud music and noise exposure - ScienceDirectExposure time and physical properties of sound direct the AuL metabolic changes.High resolution 1H NMR-based metabonomic study of the auditory cortex analogue of developing chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) following prenatal chronic loud music and noise exposure - ScienceDirectProper functional development of the auditory cortex (ACx) critically depends on early relevant sensory experiences. Exposure to high intensity noise (industrial/traffic) and music, a current public health concern, may disrupt the proper development of the ACx and associated behavior. The biochemical mechanisms associated with such activity dependent changes during development are poorly understood. Here we report the effects of prenatal chronic (last 10 days of incubation), 110 dB sound pressure level (SPL) music and noise exposure on metabolic profile of the auditory cortex analogue/field L (AuL) in domestic chicks. Perchloric acid extracts of AuL of post hatch day 1 chicks from control, music and noise groups were subjected to high resolution (700 MHz) 1H NMR spectroscopy. Multivariate regression analysis of the concentration data of 18 metabolites revealed a significant class separation between control and loud sound exposed groups, indicating a metabolic perturbation. Comparison of absolute concentration of metabolites showed that overstimulation with loud sound, independent of spectral characteristics (music or noise) led to extensive usage of major energy metabolites, e.g., glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate and ATP. On the other hand, high glutamine levels and sustained levels of neuromodulators and alternate energy sources, e.g., creatine, ascorbate and lactate indicated a systems restorative measure in a condition of neuronal hyperactivity. At the same time, decreased aspartate and taurine levels in the noise group suggested a differential impact of prenatal chronic loud noise over music exposure. Thus prenatal exposure to loud sound especially noise alters the metabolic activity in the AuL which in turn can affect the functional development and later auditory associated behaviour.Interdisciplinary Approaches to Neuroscience Epistemology and Cognition, Tobias A.

In this work, we recorded the magnetoencephalographic signal while subjects listened to music as it unfolded over long periods of time (seconds), and we developed and applied methods to correlate the time course of the regional brain activations with the dynamic aspects of the musical sound. We showed that frontal areas generally respond with slow time constants to the music, reflecting their more integrative mode; motor-related areas showed transient-mode responses to fine temporal scale structures of the sound. The study combined novel analysis techniques designed to capture and quantify fine temporal sequencing from the authentic musical piece (characterized by a clearly defined rhythm and melodic structure) with the extraction of relevant features from the dynamics of the regional brain activations. The results demonstrated that activity in motor-related structures, specifically in lateral premotor areas, supplementary motor areas, and somatomotor areas, correlated with measures of rhythmicity derived from the music. These correlations showed distinct laterality depending on how the musical performance deviated from the strict tempo of the music score, that is, depending on the musical expression.Integer Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectInteger Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectPerceptual priors on rhythm are revealed by iterated reproduction of random sequencesInteger Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectPriors in US listeners show peaks at integer ratio rhythms prevalent in Western musicInteger Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectPriors in native Amazonians are distinct but also favor some integer ratio rhythmsInteger Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectMusicians have similar priors as non-musicians, implicating passive exposure to musicInteger Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectProbability distributions over external states (priors) are essential to the interpretation of sensory signals. Priors for cultural artifacts such as music and language remain largely uncharacterized, but likely constrain cultural transmission, because only those signals with high probability under the prior can be reliably reproduced and communicated. We developed a method to estimate priors for simple rhythms via iterated reproduction of random temporal sequences. Listeners were asked to reproduce random “seed” rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus and over time became dominated by internal biases, such that the prior could be estimated by applying the procedure multiple times. We validated that the measured prior was consistent across the modality of reproduction and that it correctly predicted perceptual discrimination. We then measured listeners’ priors over the entire space of two- and three-interval rhythms. Priors in US participants showed peaks at rhythms with simple integer ratios and were similar for musicians and non-musicians. An analogous procedure produced qualitatively different results for spoken phrases, indicating some specificity to music. Priors measured in members of a native Amazonian society were distinct from those in US participants but also featured integer ratio peaks. The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of rhythm that listeners encounter. The proposed method can efficiently map out a high-resolution view of biases that shape transmission and stability of simple reproducible patterns within a culture.Integer Ratio Priors on Musical Rhythm Revealed Cross-culturally by Iterated Reproduction - ScienceDirectLead ContactImmune cognition and vaccine strategy: beyond genomics - ScienceDirectI.R. Cohen’s work on immune cognition has profound implications for vaccine strategies when simple elicitation of sterilizing immunity fails, given Nisbett’s analysis showing that cognition by the central nervous system is culturally determined.

Previous work has demonstrated marked interindividual variability in onset and rate of decline. Such variability has been linked to factors such as maintenance of functional and structural brain integrity, genetics, and lifestyle. Still, few, if any, studies have combined a longitudinal design with repeated multimodal imaging and a comprehensive assessment of cognition as well as genetic and lifestyle factors. The present paper introduces the Cognition, Brain, and Aging (COBRA) study, in which cognitive performance and brain structure and function are measured in a cohort of 181 older adults aged 64 to 68 years at baseline. Participants will be followed longitudinally over a 10-year period, resulting in a total of three equally spaced measurement occasions. The measurement protocol at each occasion comprises a comprehensive set of behavioral and imaging measures. Cognitive performance is evaluated via computerized testing of working memory, episodic memory, perceptual speed, motor speed, implicit sequence learning, and vocabulary. Brain imaging is performed using positron emission tomography with [11C]-raclopride to assess dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for assessment of white and gray-matter integrity and cerebrovascular perfusion, and functional MRI maps brain activation during rest and active task conditions. Lifestyle descriptives are collected, and blood samples are obtained and stored for future evaluation. Here, we present selected results from the baseline assessment along with a discussion of sample characteristics and methodological considerations that determined the design of the study.COBRA: A prospective multimodal imaging study of dopamine, brain structure and function, and cognition - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Memory & Aging.Non-pharmacological interventions for people with Alzheimer's Disease: A critical review of the scientific literature from the last ten years - ScienceDirectCurrently, non-pharmacological interventions are useful, versatile and potentially cost-effective tools for managing the care of people suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of the present study is to examine non-pharmacological interventions in terms of their theoretical basis and empirical evidence in improving cognition and autonomy of daily living and reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with AD. We searched the electronic databases from January 2005 until 15 November 2015 using a combination of the terms “Alzheimer's Disease and Reality Orientation”, “Cognitive Stimulation Therapy”, “Reminiscence”, “Psychodynamic therapy”, “Spaced retrieval”, “Music Therapy”, “Bright light therapy”. Non-pharmacological interventions can be grouped into four categories: Holistic techniques, Brief psychotherapies, Cognitive methods and Alternative strategies. Reality orientation and Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) were associated with a significant improvement in cognition and behaviour in mild to moderate AD patients and in reinforcing concomitant pharmacological treatment. Reminiscence was found to enhance cognition and reduce depressive symptoms. Spaced retrieval may facilitate retention and recall of meaningful items. Further research needs to be conducted to establish the impact of Bright light therapy on neuropsychiatric disturbances in AD, while the use of Music Therapy may lead to a reduction of the frequency and the extent of them. Methodological limitations such as the paucity of randomized-controlled trials and small samples size have been observed. Non-pharmacological interventions represent complementary techniques and should be tailored case by case, according to patients’ medical condition and resilience, compliance to treatment, AD severity, available sanitary and professional resources and caregiver care commitment and support.Are consonant intervals music to their ears? Spontaneous acoustic preferences in a nonhuman primate - ScienceDirectHumans find some sounds more pleasing than others; such preferences may underlie our enjoyment of music. To gain insight into the evolutionary origins of these preferences, we explored whether they are present in other animals. We designed a novel method to measure the spontaneous sound preferences of cotton-top tamarins, a species that has been extensively tested for other perceptual abilities. Animals were placed in a V-shaped maze, and their position within the maze controlled their auditory environment. One sound was played when they were in one branch of the maze, and a different sound for the opposite branch; no food was delivered during testing. We used the proportion of time spent in each branch as a measure of preference. The first two experiments were designed as tests of our method. In Experiment 1, we used loud and soft white noise as stimuli; all animals spent most of their time on the side with soft noise. In Experiment 2, tamarins spent more time on the side playing species-specific feeding chirps than on the side playing species-specific distress calls. Together, these two experiments suggest that the method is effective, providing a spontaneous measure of preference. In Experiment 3, however, subjects showed no preference for consonant over dissonant intervals. Finally, tamarins showed no preference in Experiment 4 for a screeching sound (comparable to fingernails on a blackboard) over amplitude-matched white noise. In contrast, humans showed clear preferences for the consonant intervals of Experiment 3 and the white noise of Experiment 4 using the same stimuli and a similar method. We conclude that tamarins' preferences differ qualitatively from those of humans. The preferences that support our capacity for music may, therefore, be unique among the primates, and could be music-specific adaptations.Exercise, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: More is not necessarily better - ScienceDirectRegional hypoperfusion, associated with a reduction in cerebral metabolism, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contributes to cognitive decline. Cerebral perfusion and hence cognition can be enhanced by exercise. The present review describes first how the effects of exercise on cerebral perfusion in AD are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and tissue-type plasminogen activator, the release of which is regulated by NO. A conclusion of clinical relevance is that exercise may not be beneficial for the cognitive functioning of all people with dementia if cardiovascular risk factors are present.Exercise, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: More is not necessarily better - ScienceDirectThe extent to which cardiovascular risk factors play a role in the selection of older people with dementia in clinical studies will be addressed in the second part of the review in which the effects of exercise on cognition are presented. Only eight relevant studies were found in the literature, emphasizing the paucity of studies in this field. Positive effects of exercise on cognition were reported in seven studies, including two that excluded and two that included patients with cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that cardiovascular risk factors do not necessarily undo the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition in cognitively impaired people. Further research is called for, in view of the limitations of the clinical studies reviewed here.How can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectMusic performance is examined using an analysis-by-synthesis method. As a result a note-to-tone conversion program emerged containing a generative rule system for musical performance. Some of these performance rules are presented and discussed. In particular, the purpose of the rules in music communication is analyzed. Three main purposes are identified: (1) differentiation of pitch and duration categories, (2) marking of boundaries between tone groups, and (3) timing and tuning agreement in ensembles. The possible origin of the performance rules is also discussed. Many striking similarities with speech and other types of human communication suggest that expressive details in music performance are not specific to music. On the contrary, they appear to allude to and thus become meaningful because of the listener's extramusical experiences.How can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectDie musikalische Ausführung wird durch eine Methode der Analyse durch Synthese untersucht. Daraus wird ein Programm zur Umwandlung von Noten in Töne mit einem System von Regeln zur musikalischen Ausführung abgeleitet. Einige dieser Ausführungsregeln werden beschrieben und kommentiert. Es wird besonders die Zweck dieser Regeln in der musikalischen Kommunikation analysiert. Es wurden drei wichtige Aufgaben identifiziert: (1) die Unterscheidung der Kategorien von Tonhöhe und Tondauer, (2) die Identifizierung der Grenzen zwischen Tongruppen, und (3) die rythmische und tonliche Abstimmung in den Ensembles. Es wird auch der mögliche Ursprung dieser Regeln der musikalischen Ausführung kommentiert. Zahlreiche, überraschende Ähnlickkeiten mit verschiedenen Arten der menschlichen Kommunikation, darunter die Sprache, lassen vermuten, daβ die Einzelheiten des Ausdrucks in der musikalischen Ausführung nicht nur der Musik spezifisch sind. Im Gegenteil, sie scheinen die extra-musikalischen Erfahrungen der Hörer zu anspielen und werden gerade deshalb wichtig.How can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectL'exécution musicale est examinée par une méthode d'analyse-par-synthèse. On en déduit un programme de conversion de notes à sons comportant un système de régles génératif pour l'exécution musicale. Certaines de ces règles d'exécution sont présentées et commentées. En particulier, on analyse le rôle de ces règles dans la communication musicale. Trois rôles principaux sont identifiés: (1) la différenciation des catégories de hauteur et de durée, (2) l'identification des frontières entre groupes tonaux, et (3) l'accord rythmique et de diapason dans les ensembles. On commente également l'origine possible de ces règles d'exécution musicale. De nombreuses similarités surprenantes avec divers types de communication humaine, dont la parole, suggèrent que les détails expressifs dans l'exécution musicale ne sont pas spécifiques à la musique. Au contraire, elles semblent prendre en compte les expériences extra-musicales des auditeurs et deviennent signifiantes justement grâce à celles-ci.Neural bases of eye and gaze processing: The core of social cognition - ScienceDirectEyes and gaze are very important stimuli for human social interactions. Recent studies suggest that impairments in recognizing face identity, facial emotions or in inferring attention and intentions of others could be linked to difficulties in extracting the relevant information from the eye region including gaze direction. In this review, we address the central role of eyes and gaze in social cognition. We start with behavioral data demonstrating the importance of the eye region and the impact of gaze on the most significant aspects of face processing. We review neuropsychological cases and data from various imaging techniques such as fMRI/PET and ERP/MEG, in an attempt to best describe the spatio-temporal networks underlying these processes. The existence of a neuronal eye detector mechanism is discussed as well as the links between eye gaze and social cognition impairments in autism. We suggest impairments in processing eyes and gaze may represent a core deficiency in several other brain pathologies and may be central to abnormal social cognition.Neural bases of eye and gaze processing: The core of social cognition - ScienceDirectAddress: INSERM U930, Centre de Pedopsychiatrie, CHU Bretonneau, 2 Bd Tonnellé, 37044 Tours Cedex, France.Verbal and music dichotic listening tasks reveal variations in functional cerebral asymmetry across the menstrual cycle that are phase and task dependent - ScienceDirectTwo dichotic listening tests, one a verbal consonant-vowel identification task, the other a musical chord recognition task, were administered to 32 women at two points during the menstrual cycle, menses (when oestrogen is low) and the midluteal phase (when oestrogen is high), in a counterbalanced repeated measures design. The degree of asymmetry changed across the cycle for both syllables and music. The right ear advantage recorded for the verbal task was greater during the midluteal phase than during menses. The left ear advantage recorded for the music task was greater during menses than during the midluteal phase. These reciprocal changes in asymmetry were the result of consistent changes in ear performance. From menses to the midluteal phase, left ear (right hemisphere) performance fell significantly for both tasks whereas right ear (left hemisphere) performance showed a small, but non-significant, increase. The findings are discussed in the light of evidence for phasic activational effects of gonadal steroids on both asymmetry and cognition which provide an explanation for the sometimes elusive nature and small effect size of sex differences in these characteristics. The relationships between sex differences in asymmetry and cognition are re-examined.Classifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirectHow do experts assess the quality of fine art museums? While there is a well-developed body of sociological knowledge on evaluation and classification processes, there has been little work to treat museums as an object of inquiry. Yet guidance from the multidisciplinary museum literature only offers an undersocialized view of these organizations. I argue that museums offer a rich opportunity to study how classification, cognition, and interaction unfold in a developed field, because valuation processes are related to aesthetics in a particularly rich way. A diverse group of museum professionals offer their perspectives on organizational quality. The study finds that art professionals make an extensive range of symbolic distinctions in their understanding of quality, some of which are shared. How individuals compare museums to one another illuminates implicit status hierarchies and classification biases in cognition. A unique contribution of this study lies in the explication of different kinds of interactions between museums. In doing so, this study adds depth to prior work on evaluation, and breadth to research on inter-organization relationships.Classifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirect► Quality evaluations of organizations relate to classification, cognition, and interaction. ► Art professionals make symbolic distinctions between art museums in a range of ways. ► How experts compare organizations with one another reveals implicit status hierarchies and variation in shared culture. ► Assessments of reasons for quality uncertainty adds depth to studies of organizations.Classifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirectMark C.

According to reductionist theories, listeners judge the structural importance of musical events while forming mental representations. These judgments may result from the production of reduced memory representations that retain only the musical gist. In a study of improvised music performance, pianists produced variations on melodies. Analyses of the musical events retained across variations provided support for the reductionist account of structural importance. A neural network trained to produce reduced memory representations for the same melodies represented structurally important events more efficiently than others. Agreement among the musicians' improvisations, the network model, and music-theoretic predictions suggest that perceived constancy across musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist mechanism for producing memory representations.Reduced memory representations for music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reduced memory representations for music - ScienceDirectThis research was partially supported by NIMH Grant l R29-MH45764 to Caroline Palmer, and by ONR Grant N00014-92-J115 to Jordan B.

We examined whether brief meditation training affects cognition and mood when compared to an active control group. After four sessions of either meditation training or listening to a recorded book, participants with no prior meditation experience were assessed with measures of mood, verbal fluency, visual coding, and working memory. Both interventions were effective at improving mood but only brief meditation training reduced fatigue, anxiety, and increased mindfulness. Moreover, brief mindfulness training significantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning. Our findings suggest that 4 days of meditation training can enhance the ability to sustain attention; benefits that have previously been reported with long-term meditators.Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: Evidence of brief mental training - ScienceDirectThis research was part of the doctoral dissertation of the first author under the supervision of the second author.Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to responsiveness to tempo in dance - ScienceDirectConscientiousness and Extraversion relate to responsiveness to tempo in dance - ScienceDirectConscientious dancers were more responsive to tempo differences in music.Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to responsiveness to tempo in dance - ScienceDirectIntroversion increased responsiveness to tempo to a lesser degree.Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to responsiveness to tempo in dance - ScienceDirectEmpathy did not increase responsiveness to tempo despite theory and prediction.Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to responsiveness to tempo in dance - ScienceDirectResults may reflect conscious and preconscious processes.Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to responsiveness to tempo in dance - ScienceDirectPrevious research has shown broad relationships between personality and dance, but the relationship between personality and specific structural features of music has not been explored. The current study explores the influence of personality and trait empathy on dancers’ responsiveness to small tempo differences between otherwise musically identical stimuli, measured by difference in the amount in acceleration of key joints. Thirty participants were recorded using motion capture while dancing to excerpts from six popular songs that were time-stretched to be slightly faster or slower than their original tempi. Analysis revealed that higher conscientiousness and lower extraversion both correlated with greater responsiveness to tempo change. Partial correlation analysis revealed that conscientiousness remained significantly correlated with responsiveness when extraversion was controlled, but not vice versa. No effect of empathy was found. Implications are discussed.How domain specific is motivation and engagement across school, sport, and music? A substantive–methodological synergy assessing young sportspeople and musicians - ScienceDirectThe primary purpose of this study was to examine the domain specificity (or otherwise) of motivation and engagement across academic, sport, and music domains using a survey-based methodology with parallel forms of the Motivation and Engagement Scale. The secondary purpose of the study was a methodological one seeking to test the most appropriate analytical means of assessing domain specificity. The sample comprised 329 young sportspeople (62% of total sample; 53% male; mean age 14 years) and classical musicians (38% of total sample; 40% male; mean age 14 years) in which target academic, sporting, and music domains are salient. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) led to the conclusion of modest domain specificity in motivation and engagement. This conclusion was based on fit indices for competing models, the size of parallel between-domain correlations, the proportion of shared variance between parallel domains, the number of within-domain correlations that were higher than parallel between-domain correlations, the decline in model fit when parallel correlations were constrained to be equal, and differences between parallel means. Notwithstanding this, constructs that were more trait-like evinced relatively less specificity. In terms of the secondary, methodological purpose, the study found that CFAs that correlated parallel uniquenesses resolved biased parameters found in raw scale score correlations that did not correct for unreliability and CFAs that did not correlate parallel uniquenesses. Together, findings hold implications for more targeted intervention, guidance for appropriate analysis in parallel domains using parallel measures, and more differentiated approaches to measurement.How domain specific is motivation and engagement across school, sport, and music?

No measures specifically targeting MPA in adolescents have been empirically validated. This article presents findings of an initial study into the psychometric properties and validation of the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory for Adolescents (MPAI-A), a new self-report measure of MPA for this group. Data from 381 elite young musicians aged 12–19 years was used to investigate the factor structure, internal reliability, construct and divergent validity of the MPAI-A. Cronbach's α for the full measure was .91. Factor analysis identified three factors, which together accounted for 53% of the variance. Construct validity was demonstrated by significant positive relationships with social phobia (measured using the Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory [Beidel, D. C., Turner, S. M., & Morris, T. L. (1995). A new inventory to assess childhood social anxiety and phobia: The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children. Psychological Assessment, 7(1), 73–79; Beidel, D. C., Turner, S. M., & Morris, T. L. (1998). Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C). North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems Inc.]) and trait anxiety (measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory [Spielberger, C. D. (1983). State-Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI (Form Y). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc.]). The MPAI-A demonstrated convergent validity by a moderate to strong positive correlation with an adult measure of MPA. Discriminant validity was established by a weaker positive relationship with depression, and no relationship with externalizing behavior problems. It is hoped that the MPAI-A, as the first empirically validated measure of adolescent musicians’ performance anxiety, will enhance and promote phenomenological and treatment research in this area.Cognition of Complex Events: Visual Scenes and Music - ScienceDirectThe ecological approach has become well-established in the domain traditionally known as "perception." Opposition to memory as a theoretical construct implies no judgment that the problems o f memory are unimportant or impossible to address. People do show the phenomena of remembering and forgetting, and there is no denying the necessity of understanding just how and why such phenomena occur. The issues raised by ecologically-oriented writers concern the concepts one use to understand the phenomena of memory—the challenge posed by the ecological approach is to conceptualize these phenomena without reliance on the notion of memory "stores" containing countless numbers of "engrams," "images," "traces," etc. The ecological approach to memory phenomena might be made comparable with the concept of schemata. The empirical phenomena of coherence and fusion led to conclude that "events can be primary units of analysis," and that these "events are natural wholes that are, so-to-speak, perceived through the slides (of a picture sequence), rather than built up from the slides."Cognition of Complex Events: Visual Scenes and Music - ScienceDirectI thank W.J.

Based on domain specific adaptations of the Motivation and Engagement Scale, multi-group confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) tested invariance across the seven domains. First and higher order multi-group CFAs demonstrated broad invariance in factor loadings (in particular), factor correlations/variances, and uniquenesses across performance domains. Taken together, the present data support the hypothesized generality of key motivation and engagement constructs. Findings hold implications for pragmatic, statistical, substantive, and intervention considerations in motivation and engagement research and also for research into cognate constructs in personality psychology more generally.Motivation and engagement in diverse performance settings: Testing their generality across school, university/college, work, sport, music, and daily life - ScienceDirectThis article was in part prepared while the author was Visiting Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Education at the University of Oxford.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectPatients with cerebellar disorders show impaired musical ability.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectPatients with Machado–Joseph disease perform worse than with cerebellar infarction.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectCognition in cerebellar disorders can be evaluated by testing musical ability.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe cerebellum contributes not only to motor coordination but also to cognitive processing. Emphasizing the cerebro–cerebellar connectivity, present literature declares a decisive role of the cerebellum in music perception.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectPatients with cerebellar disorders (n = 15) due to infarction or genetically caused degeneration were tested on their musical ability and compared to matched healthy control subjects. We used a validated and standardized test of musical ability including the reproduction of rhythm and meter, melody comparison, emotion identification, pitch discrimination and the recognition of familiar melodies.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe patient group presented significantly lower scores in the subtests meter, melody comparison and emotion identification as compared to healthy control subjects. Rhythm reproduction and pitch discrimination were not affected by cerebellar disorders.The impact of cerebellar disorders on musical ability - ScienceDirectTesting musical ability in cerebellar disorders may serve as an additional tool to detect and quantify cognitive deficits, namely for music perception. As a consequence, it might be that musical stimulation can be helpful in cognitive impairment due to cerebellar lesions.Varieties of musical experience - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we argue that music cognition involves the use of acoustic and auditory codes to evoke a variety of conscious experiences. The variety of domains that are encompassed by music is so diverse that it is unclear whether a single domain of structure or experience is defining. Music is best understood as a form of communication in which formal codes (acoustic patterns and their auditory representations) are employed to elicit a variety of conscious experiences. After proposing our theoretical perspective we offer three prominent examples of conscious experiences elicited by the code of music: the recognition of structure itself, affect, and the experience of motion.Music and Language in Degenerative Disease of the Brain - ScienceDirectMusic and language functions were studied in two musicians with degenerative disease. Both patients were tested on a standardized language battery and a series of music tasks. In the first case with left cortical atrophy and primary progressive aphasia, expressive music functions were spared with impaired reception of rhythm. The second case with posterior cortical atrophy, greater on the right, was nonaphasic, had spatial agraphia, a visuopractic deficit, and severe expressive music deficits, but intact rhythm repetition. The aphasic patient showed dissociations between music and language in fluency and content; continuous, organized, although reiterative music production was contrasted with nonfluent language. The nonaphasic patient showed the opposite pattern of deficits; unmusical production with impaired melody and rhythm organization that was contrasted with fluent, intelligible language. The double dissociation between language and music functions supports the existence of independent cognitive systems, one consistent with conventional left lateralization models of language, temporal sequence, and analytic music processing and another with a right lateralization model of implicit music cognition.Expression of Pre-service Teachers’ Emotional Competency in their Educational Practice - ScienceDirectNowadays rapid and complicated development of the world challenges pre-service teachers and their competencies. The article aims at defining the expression of future music teachers’ emotional competency, emphasising the necessity to reflect on one's emotions in educational practice, while they communicate with school learners. The results of qualitative content analysis also highlighted the factors, which predetermine professional self-determination of teachers of music to be. Twenty-three 4th year students (pre-service teachers) involved in the programme of music education at Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences participated in the research, which aimed to compare students’ assessment with that of practice supervisors.Expression of Pre-service Teachers’ Emotional Competency in their Educational Practice - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Research and Education Center.The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services - ScienceDirectThis article examines the effects of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services. An experimental study was conducted to test three different constructs—perceived wait duration, emotional evaluation of the service environment and emotional response to the wait—as mediators between music and behavioral response to the service organization. Results of the study showed that, regardless of its valence, music ameliorates emotional evaluation of the service environment which in turn positively affects approach behavior towards the service organization. Furthermore, positively valenced music triggers a more positive emotional response to the wait and a stronger approach behavior towards the service organization than negatively valenced music. Although positively valenced music also increases perceived wait duration, the latter does not have a significant effect on consumers' behavioral response to the service organization.The effect of musical training on music processing: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans - ScienceDirectPrevious studies have demonstrated changes in neuronal activity in trained musicians relative to controls while performing various music processing tasks. In this study the neural correlates of the effect of music training on two aspects of music processing, melody and harmony, are investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen subjects, seven with continuous musical training from early childhood to adulthood and eight without, underwent a passive fMRI listening paradigm designed to test the effects of melodic and harmonic processing. Melodic processing activated the most anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus for both musicians and non-musicians, while harmonic processing activated different visual association areas for musicians relative to non-musicians. The inferior parietal lobules were recruited only by musicians for both tasks. We conclude that musical training results in the recruitment of different neural networks for these aspects of music processing.Acquired amusia - ScienceDirectRecent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of music suggest that a further review of the topic of amusia is timely. In this chapter, we first consider previous taxonomies of amusia and propose a fresh framework for understanding the amusias, essentially as disorders of cognitive information processing. We critically review current cognitive and neuroanatomic findings in the published literature on amusia. We assess the extent to which the clinical and neuropsychologic evidence in amusia can be reconciled; both with the information-processing framework we propose, and with the picture of the brain organization of music and language processing emerging from cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroimaging studies. The balance of evidence suggests that the amusias can be understood as disorders of musical object cognition targeting separable levels of an information-processing hierarchy and underpinned by specific brain network dysfunction. The neuroanatomic associations of the amusias show substantial overlap with brain networks that process speech; however, this convergence leaves scope for separable brain mechanisms based on altered connectivity and dynamics across culprit networks. The study of the amusias contributes to an increasingly complex picture of the musical brain that transcends any simple dichotomy between music and speech or other complex sounds.The development of evaluative responses to music:: Infants prefer to listen to consonance over dissonance - ScienceDirectIn Experiment 1, 6-month-old infants looked longer in order to listen to a set of consonant intervals than to a set of dissonant intervals. In Experiment 2, infants preferred to listen to the original version of a Mozart minuet than to a version altered to contain many dissonant intervals. Thus, although infants do not yet have the musical-system-specific knowledge of scale structure that is involved in adults' emotional reactions to music, infants are similar to adults in their evaluative reactions to consonance and dissonance.The development of evaluative responses to music:: Infants prefer to listen to consonance over dissonance - ScienceDirectLaurel J. Trainor, Department of Psychology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4K1Affect modification through evaluative conditioning with music - ScienceDirectResults from two studies are reported which investigated the affective impact of strongly evaluated music and its evaluative conditioning potential. The first experiment showed that positively or negatively evaluated music could be used to establish a conditioned response to previously neutral Greek letter stimuli. It was found that the affective responses elicited by liked or disliked music transferred onto previously neutral stimuli changing subjects' evaluation of and preference for these stimuli accordingly. The second study examined the potential of music to change existing negative affective responses to feared animals in persons with genuine animal phobias. Positively evaluated (liked) music was included in every second treatment session involving in vivo exposure to the feared animals. Overall, results show that liked music invoked a positive affective state that increased the effectiveness of in vivo exposure. In sessions with music clients' evaluations and fear decreased more than in sessions without music. The role of music in emotional processing is discussed as well as alternative explanations for the effects of music.Cognition, creativity, and entrepreneurship - ScienceDirectCognitive approaches to creativity are discussed as they relate to an important task of entrepreneurs: generating novel and useful ideas for business ventures. Attention is given to the paradoxical role of knowledge, which can either enhance of inhibit creativity, as well as to the properties of knowledge and a selected set of processes that influence the originality of newly generated ideas. Experimental findings are discussed along with suggestions about how those findings might be translated to practical applications.Is There Really an Evolved Capacity for Number? - ScienceDirectThere is a widely accepted view in cognitive neuroscience, child psychology, and animal cognition that there is a biologically evolved capacity specific for number and arithmetic that humans share with other species.Is There Really an Evolved Capacity for Number? - ScienceDirectHowever, data from various sources – humans from non-industrialized cultures, trained nonhuman animals in captivity, and the neuroscience of symbol processing in schooled participants – do not support this view.Is There Really an Evolved Capacity for Number? - ScienceDirectThe use of loose and misleading technical terminology in ‘numerical cognition’ has facilitated the elaboration of teleological claims which underlie the above view.Is There Really an Evolved Capacity for Number? - ScienceDirectBiologically evolved preconditions for quantification do exist, but the emergence of number and arithmetic proper – absent in nonhuman animals – has materialized via cultural preoccupations and practices that are supported by language and symbolic reference – crucial dimensions that lie largely outside natural selection.Is There Really an Evolved Capacity for Number? - ScienceDirectHumans and other species have biologically endowed abilities for discriminating quantities. A widely accepted view sees such abilities as an evolved capacity specific for number and arithmetic. This view, however, is based on an implicit teleological rationale, builds on inaccurate conceptions of biological evolution, downplays human data from non-industrialized cultures, overinterprets results from trained animals, and is enabled by loose terminology that facilitates teleological argumentation. A distinction between quantical (e.g., quantity discrimination) and numerical (exact, symbolic) cognition is needed: quantical cognition provides biologically evolved preconditions for numerical cognition but it does not scale up to number and arithmetic, which require cultural mediation. The argument has implications for debates about the origins of other special capacities – geometry, music, art, and language.The source dilemma hypothesis: Perceptual uncertainty contributes to musical emotion - ScienceDirectThe source dilemma hypothesis: Perceptual uncertainty contributes to musical emotion - ScienceDirectEvolutionary principles of audition and emotion predict emotional responses to music.The source dilemma hypothesis: Perceptual uncertainty contributes to musical emotion - ScienceDirectMelody location and timbre were altered to change uncertainty in the auditory scene.The source dilemma hypothesis: Perceptual uncertainty contributes to musical emotion - ScienceDirectAltered melodies were rated more pleasant when congruent with auditory scene cues.The source dilemma hypothesis: Perceptual uncertainty contributes to musical emotion - ScienceDirectMusic’s emotive capacity relies on the perceived uncertainty of the auditory scene.The source dilemma hypothesis: Perceptual uncertainty contributes to musical emotion - ScienceDirectMusic can evoke powerful emotions in listeners. Here we provide the first empirical evidence that the principles of auditory scene analysis and evolutionary theories of emotion are critical to a comprehensive theory of musical emotion. We interpret these data in light of a theoretical framework termed “the source dilemma hypothesis,” which predicts that uncertainty in the number, identity or location of sound objects elicits unpleasant emotions by presenting the auditory system with an incoherent percept, thereby motivating listeners to resolve the auditory ambiguity. We describe two experiments in which source location and timbre were manipulated to change uncertainty in the auditory scene. In both experiments, listeners rated tonal and atonal melodies with congruent auditory scene cues as more pleasant than melodies with incongruent auditory scene cues. These data suggest that music’s emotive capacity relies in part on the perceptual uncertainty it produces regarding the auditory scene.Cross-modal interactions in the experience of musical performances: Physiological correlates - ScienceDirectThis experiment was conducted to investigate cross-modal interactions in the emotional experience of music listeners. Previous research showed that visual information present in a musical performance is rich in expressive content, and moderates the subjective emotional experience of a participant listening and/or observing musical stimuli [Vines, B. W., Krumhansl, C. L., Wanderley, M. M., & Levitin, D. J. (2006). Cross-modal interactions in the perception of musical performance. Cognition, 101, 80--113.]. The goal of this follow-up experiment was to replicate this cross-modal interaction by investigating the objective, physiological aspect of emotional response to music measuring electrodermal activity. The scaled average of electrodermal amplitude for visual–auditory presentation was found to be significantly higher than the sum of the reactions when the music was presented in visual only (VO) and auditory only (AO) conditions, suggesting the presence of an emergent property created by bimodal interaction. Functional data analysis revealed that electrodermal activity generally followed the same contour across modalities of presentation, except during rests (silent parts of the performance) when the visual information took on particular salience. Finally, electrodermal activity and subjective tension judgments were found to be most highly correlated in the audio-visual (AV) condition than in the unimodal conditions. The present study provides converging evidence for the importance of seeing musical performances, and preliminary evidence for the utility of electrodermal activity as an objective measure in studies of continuous music-elicited emotions.We think you can dance!

Six experiments were designed to explore the perceptual basis of emotional judgments in music. In each experiment, the same set of 32 excerpts taken from the classical repertoire and intended to convey a happy or sad tone were presented under various transformations and with different task demands. In Expts. 1 to 3, subjects were required to judge on a 10-point scale whether the excerpts were happy or sad. Altogether the results show that emotional judgments are (a) highly consistent across subjects and resistant to brain damage; (b) determined by musical structure (mode and tempo); and (c) immediate. Experiments 4 to 6 were designed to assess whether emotional and non-emotional judgments reflect the operations of a single perceptual analysis system. To this aim, we searched for evidence of dissociation in our brain-damaged patient, I.R., by using tasks that do not require emotional interpretation. These non-emotional tasks were a `same-different' classification task (Expt. 4), error detection tasks (Expt. 5A,B) and a change monitoring task (Expt. 6). I.R. was impaired in these non-emotional tasks except when the change affected the mode and the tempo of the excerpt, in which case I.R. performed close to normal. The results are discussed in relation to the possibility that emotional and non-emotional judgments are the products of distinct pathways.An exercise-based randomized controlled trial on brain, cognition, physical health and mental health in overweight/obese children (ActiveBrains project): Rationale, design and methods - ScienceDirectThe new and recent advances in neuroelectric and neuroimaging technologies provide a new era for further exploring and understanding how brain and cognition function can be stimulated by environmental factors, such as exercise, and particularly to study whether physical exercise influences brain development in early ages. The present study, namely the ActiveBrains project, aims to examine the effects of a physical exercise programme on brain and cognition, as well as on selected physical and mental health outcomes in overweight/obese children. A total of 100 participants aged 8 to 11 years are randomized into an exercise group (N = 50) or a control group (N = 50). The intervention lasts 20-weeks, with 3–5 sessions per week of 90 min each, and is mainly focused on high-intensity aerobic exercise yet also includes muscle-strengthening exercises. The extent to what the intervention effect remains 8-months after the exercise programme finishes is also studied in a subsample. Brain structure and function and cognitive performance are assessed using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalographic recordings. Secondary outcomes include physical health outcomes (e.g. physical fitness, body fatness, bone mass and lipid-metabolic factors) and mental health outcomes (e.g. chronic stress indicators and overall behavioural and personality measurements such as anxiety or depression). This project will substantially contribute to the existing knowledge and will have an impact on societies, since early stimulation of brain development might have long lasting consequences on cognitive performance, academic achievement and in the prevention of behavioural problems and the promotion of psychological adjustment and mental health.An exercise-based randomized controlled trial on brain, cognition, physical health and mental health in overweight/obese children (ActiveBrains project): Rationale, design and methods - ScienceDirectClinical trials. Gov identifier: NCT02295072Implicit cognition and the maintenance and treatment of major depression - ScienceDirectAlthough extensive research has identified the role of consciously expressed cognition in the onset and maintenance of depression, much less work has directly examined the role of nonconscious, automatic, implicit cognition biases and depression. Further, whereas there is evidence of changes in self-report measures of cognition following cognitive therapy, there has been little work that identifies the specific therapeutic techniques that may directly modify nonconscious implicit cognition among depressed individuals. Improving our understanding of the role of implicit cognition in depression and how to manage these cognitive processes may help add to the efficacy of cognitive therapy. We review the literature examining the association between implicit cognition and depression and then describe potential therapeutic strategies for managing nonconscious implicit cognition biases in depression. Finally, we propose future directions of study, including a proposed cognitive-interpersonal framework for understanding therapeutic interactions in managing implicit cognition biases.Implicit cognition and the maintenance and treatment of major depression - ScienceDirectPreparation of this article was supported by a NARSAD Young Investigator Award given to Michael A. Friedman.Tunes stuck in your brain: The frequency and affective evaluation of involuntary musical imagery correlate with cortical structure - ScienceDirectTunes stuck in your brain: The frequency and affective evaluation of involuntary musical imagery correlate with cortical structure - ScienceDirectWe used MRI to uncover the brain structure of Involuntary Musical Imagery (INMI).Tunes stuck in your brain: The frequency and affective evaluation of involuntary musical imagery correlate with cortical structure - ScienceDirectWe investigated frequency of INMI as well as their evaluative aspects.Tunes stuck in your brain: The frequency and affective evaluation of involuntary musical imagery correlate with cortical structure - ScienceDirectFrequency was related to regions involved in musical imagery and spontaneous cognition.Tunes stuck in your brain: The frequency and affective evaluation of involuntary musical imagery correlate with cortical structure - ScienceDirectEvaluative aspects of INMI correlated with areas involved in emotions and memory.Tunes stuck in your brain: The frequency and affective evaluation of involuntary musical imagery correlate with cortical structure - ScienceDirectRecent years have seen a growing interest in the neuroscience of spontaneous cognition. One form of such cognition is involuntary musical imagery (INMI), the non-pathological and everyday experience of having music in one’s head, in the absence of an external stimulus. In this study, aspects of INMI, including frequency and affective evaluation, were measured by self-report in 44 subjects and related to variation in brain structure in these individuals. Frequency of INMI was related to cortical thickness in regions of right frontal and temporal cortices as well as the anterior cingulate and left angular gyrus. Affective aspects of INMI, namely the extent to which subjects wished to suppress INMI or considered them helpful, were related to gray matter volume in right temporopolar and parahippocampal cortices respectively. These results provide the first evidence that INMI is a common internal experience recruiting brain networks involved in perception, emotions, memory and spontaneous thoughts.Computer Applications in Music Composition and Research - ScienceDirectThe chapter describes activities in three areas of computing applications in music: music score input and output, sound generation and manipulation, and research on musical structure and performance. The chapter focuses on ways of representing music scores for computer storage, retrieval, and manipulation, and includes a discussion of two representative music codes, encoding devices and software, and music printing. The chapter discusses computer applications in music composition and includes information about the Musical Instrument Digital Interface(MIDI) standard, digital sound synthesis, and computer-aided composition. The chapter presents a survey of computer applications in music research and includes discussions of database developments, data structures for music analysis, adaptations of artificial intelligence techniques and concepts from cognitive science, and research into expressive musical performance. This chapter describes efforts arising from Algorithmic composition (Al) research whose goal is the composition of music in stylistic imitation of earlier composers. The most promising approaches are those using grammatical approaches and connectionist networks. In conclusion, the chapter presents comments on the current situation in each of these areas and then address briefly three philosophical issues attending the use of computers by musicians.Computer Applications in Music Composition and Research - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Problem of Linguistic Analysis of Musical Metaphors at Lessons of Russian as a Foreign Language - ScienceDirectThe main object of practical training in Russian as a foreign language at an advanced stage is to teach students to apply theoretical knowledge in practice, for a more complete understanding of various texts. Along with this, an important problem is the process of interpreting and systematizing of metaphors. In article within an anthropocentric paradigm, the mental bases of human activity are considered. In particular, features of perception and interpretation of musical sounding of professional musicians in the critiques devoted to the description of music in operas. The purpose of research to explore the specificity of the sign marking musical images by music critics, and attempt to classify and describe them. The theory of a conceptual metaphor and metaphorical modeling acts as a methodology. The carried-out analysis allowed revealing three main models: Music – the world of artifacts (subjects), Music is the world of the person, Music is the world of the nature. The main objectives of authors of these articles to convey the meaning of operas, to make “an intersemiotics translation”, i.e., to describe feelings from perception of music, by resources of a natural language.The Problem of Linguistic Analysis of Musical Metaphors at Lessons of Russian as a Foreign Language - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of IECC 2015.N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor modulators and related medications for the enhancement of auditory system plasticity in schizophrenia - ScienceDirectDeficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate-type (NMDAR) function contribute to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, particularly dysfunction in neuroplasticity, defined as reduced learning during training on exercises that place implicit, increasing demands on early sensory (auditory and visual) information processing. Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) can be both a target engagement biomarker for the NMDAR and a proxy measure of neurophysiological plasticity. This review covers the evidence for using NMDAR modulator and related compounds for enhancement of cognition, with a particular focus on early auditory processing/plasticity. Compounds covered include glycine site agonists, glycine and system A-type transporter inhibitors, d-amino acid oxidase inhibitors, memantine and nicotinic alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor agonists. As opposed to daily treatment studies focusing on schizophrenia in general, intermittent, non-daily treatment combining NMDAR modulators with neuroplasticity-based paradigms, using MMN as target-engagement biomarkers show promise as treatments to both remediate plasticity deficits and overall functional deficits.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectPaired excerpts of lullabies and comparison songs from different areas of the world were presented to Western adult listeners, who were required to identify the lullaby in each pair. In Experiment 1, when presented with original field recordings, adults successfully differentiated the lullabies from the other songs. In Experiment 2, this effect was replicated with a more diverse sample of listeners. In addition, feedback about correct performance failed to improve the accuracy of lullaby identification. In Experiment 3, adults successfully identified the lullabies even when all songs were electronically filtered to remove the words. In Experiment 4, adults were unsuccessful in lullaby identification when the melodies were synthesized to remove residual cues associated with voice quality. However, performance on the synthesized materials was correlated with performance on the original materials. Parallels between infant-directed music and infant-directed speech are noted.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectThis research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the University of Toronto.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectLaurel Trainor is now at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Great ape cognition and captive care: Can cognitive challenges enhance well-being? - ScienceDirectGiven the close genetic link between humans and nonhuman great apes, the well-being of the latter in captivity is understandably controversial. Behavioural signs of boredom, anxiety and stress in captive great apes have been linked to being reared in small groups or by humans, and by having a lack of control over the environment. This review proposes a new framework for great ape enrichment, inspired by a century of cognitive research. Problem-solving tasks that are designed so challenge the evolved cognitive skills of great apes might allow subjects to have more control in inherently restricted environments. These sorts of tasks have historically been used to test the comparative cognitive abilities of great apes housed in research facilities, with few parallel assessments of well-being. However, there is great potential for ‘cognitive challenge’ tasks to be applied to great apes in a range of captive settings for the enhancement of well-being. This is based on recent research on farmed animals, demonstrating that they may seek cognitive challenges and benefit from their own learning success. A new definition of ‘cognitive enrichment’ – where an appropriate cognitive challenge results in measurable beneficial changes to well-being – is proposed to encourage research at the interface of great ape cognition and well-being. Finally, two approaches to great ape cognitive enrichment – ‘low-investment’ and ‘high-investment’ – are proposed for future research.Decision Making as a Window on Cognition - ScienceDirectA decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on information and values associated with the possible outcomes. The process operates in a flexible timeframe that is free from the immediacy of evidence acquisition and the real time demands of action itself. Thus, it involves deliberation, planning, and strategizing. This Perspective focuses on perceptual decision making in nonhuman primates and the discovery of neural mechanisms that support accuracy, speed, and confidence in a decision. We suggest that these mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general, and we speculate about the challenges and directions before the field.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectMusical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectN1 enhancement and MMN are influenced by pitch and rhythm musical structures.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectThe N1 enhancement reflects a basic sensory memory process.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectMMN shows independent but cooperative modules for pitch and rhythm dimensions.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectInvoluntary switch of attention associated with P3a reflects no musical modulation.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectMusic represents a complex form of human cognition. To what extent our auditory system is attuned to music is yet to be clearly understood. Our principal aim was to determine whether the neurophysiological operations underlying pre-attentive auditory change detection (N1 enhancement (N1e)/Mismatch Negativity (MMN)) and the subsequent involuntary attentional reallocation (P3a) towards infrequent sound omissions, are influenced by differences in musical content. Specifically, we intended to explore any interaction effects that rhythmic and pitch dimensions of musical organization may have over these processes. Results showed that both the N1e and MMN amplitudes were differentially influenced by rhythm and pitch dimensions. MMN latencies were shorter for musical structures containing both features. This suggests some neurocognitive independence between pitch and rhythm domains, but also calls for further address on possible interactions between both of them at the level of early, automatic auditory detection. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the N1e reflects basic sensory memory processes. Lastly, we show that the involuntary switch of attention associated with the P3a reflects a general-purpose mechanism not modulated by musical features. Altogether, the N1e/MMN/P3a complex elicited by infrequent sound omissions revealed evidence of musical influence over early stages of auditory perception.An early Phase II randomised controlled trial testing the effect on persecutory delusions of using CBT to reduce negative cognitions about the self: The potential benefits of enhancing self confidence - ScienceDirectResearch has shown that paranoia may directly build on negative ideas about the self. Feeling inferior can lead to ideas of vulnerability. The clinical prediction is that decreasing negative self cognitions will reduce paranoia.An early Phase II randomised controlled trial testing the effect on persecutory delusions of using CBT to reduce negative cognitions about the self: The potential benefits of enhancing self confidence - ScienceDirectThirty patients with persistent persecutory delusions were randomised to receive brief CBT in addition to standard care or to standard care (ISRCTN06118265). The six session intervention was designed to decrease negative, and increase positive, self cognitions. Assessments at baseline, 8 weeks (posttreatment) and 12 weeks were carried out by a rater blind to allocation. The primary outcomes were posttreatment scores for negative self beliefs and paranoia. Secondary outcomes were psychological well-being, positive beliefs about the self, persecutory delusions, social comparison, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.An early Phase II randomised controlled trial testing the effect on persecutory delusions of using CBT to reduce negative cognitions about the self: The potential benefits of enhancing self confidence - ScienceDirectTrial recruitment and retention were feasible and the intervention highly acceptable to the patients. All patients provided follow-up data. Posttreatment there was a small reduction in negative self beliefs (Cohen's d = 0.24) and a moderate reduction in paranoia (d = 0.59), but these were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant improvements in psychological well-being (d = 1.16), positive beliefs about the self (d = 1.00), negative social comparison (d = 0.88), self-esteem (d = 0.62), and depression (d = 0.68). No improvements were maintained. No adverse events were associated with the intervention.An early Phase II randomised controlled trial testing the effect on persecutory delusions of using CBT to reduce negative cognitions about the self: The potential benefits of enhancing self confidence - ScienceDirectThe intervention produced short-term gains consistent with the prediction that improving cognitions about the self will reduce persecutory delusions. The improvement in psychological well-being is important in its own right. We recommend that the different elements of the intervention are tested separately and that the treatment is lengthened.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectMaternal intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) is critical during perinatal development of the brain. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the most abundant n-3 PUFA in the brain and influences neuronal membrane function and neuroprotection. The present study aims to assess the effect of dietary n-3 PUFA availability during the gestational and postnatal period on cognition, brain metabolism and neurohistology in C57BL/6J mice.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectFemale wild-type C57BL/6J mice at day 0 of gestation were randomly assigned to either an n-3 PUFA deficient diet (0.05% of total fatty acids) or an n-3 PUFA adequate diet (3.83% of total fatty acids) containing preformed DHA and its precursor α-linolenic acid. Male offspring remained on diet and performed cognitive tests during puberty and adulthood. In adulthood, animals underwent 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess brain energy metabolites. Thereafter, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed assessing inflammation, neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectCompared to the n-3 PUFA deficient group, pubertal n-3 PUFA adequate fed mice demonstrated increased motor coordination. Adult n-3 PUFA adequate fed mice exhibited increased exploratory behavior, sensorimotor integration and spatial memory, while neurogenesis in the hippocampus was decreased. Selected brain regions of n-3 PUFA adequate fed mice contained significantly lower levels of arachidonic acid and higher levels of DHA and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectOur data suggest that dietary n-3 PUFA can modify neural maturation and enhance brain functioning in healthy C57BL/6J mice. This indicates that availability of n-3 PUFA in infant diet during early development may have a significant impact on brain development.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectGrants, sponsors and funding sources: This work was financed by a research grant of Mead Johnson Pediatric Nutrition Institute.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectShared penultimate authorship.Patient education combined in a music and habit-forming intervention for adherence to continuous positive airway (CPAP) prescribed for sleep apnea - ScienceDirectAs many as 50% of patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea stop adhering to the prescribed medical treatment of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) within 1–3 weeks of onset. Thus, a theory-based intervention using music to support habit formation was designed to improve CPAP adherence at onset. The intervention materials included directions for CPAP nightly use, a diary for recording nightly use and writing about CPAP benefits or problems. In addition, an audiotape with softly spoken instructions for placing the CPAP mask comfortably, using deep breathing and muscle relaxation along with the slowly decreasing music tempo was provided to listen to at bedtime each night.Patient education combined in a music and habit-forming intervention for adherence to continuous positive airway (CPAP) prescribed for sleep apnea - ScienceDirectEffects of this music intervention were tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 97 patients with 53 males (55%) and 44 females (45%). Moderate to severe apnea/hyponea scores (per sleep laboratory data) and medical diagnosis of OSA were required for study inclusion.Patient education combined in a music and habit-forming intervention for adherence to continuous positive airway (CPAP) prescribed for sleep apnea - ScienceDirectCompared to placebo controls, a greater proportion of experimental patients were adhering (χ2 = 14.67, p < 0.01; a large difference, Phi = 0.39) at the end of the first month of CPAP onset. There were no differences in CPAP adherence at 3 (X2 = 0.065, p = 0.79) and 6 (X2 = .118, p = 0.73) months. Patients’ diary data and satisfaction survey results indicated the intervention was rated as helpful and guided formation of a relaxing, habitual routine of CPAP nightly use.Patient education combined in a music and habit-forming intervention for adherence to continuous positive airway (CPAP) prescribed for sleep apnea - ScienceDirectThe intervention had a strong effect for improving adherence to CPAP at 1 month.Patient education combined in a music and habit-forming intervention for adherence to continuous positive airway (CPAP) prescribed for sleep apnea - ScienceDirectAdherence at the onset of treatment is critical and the audio music intervention was easily administered. Other interventions that target problems interfering with longer-term CPAP adherence are needed.Some early cases of aphasia and the capacity to sing - ScienceDirectThis chapter examines early cases of aphasia that include observations of the capacity to sing. Although the majority of these cases were published in the late nineteenth century, earlier reports exist and provide insights into the early thinking about the capacity to sing in aphasia, a topic that continues to the present day. The observation that some patients with aphasia and limited speech output were able to sing the texts of songs inspired scholars to examine the relationship between music and language. Early ideas about the capacity to sing were provided by well-known neurologists, such as John Hughlings Jackson and Adolf Kussmaul. The work of Herbert Spencer about the origins and function of music heavily influenced Jackson and others in their thinking about aphasia. This work also led to an increased interest in understanding music abilities in persons with aphasia and, later, in the brain mechanisms of music. The chapter provides a background as to why there was an interest in the capacity to sing in persons with aphasia and what influenced early thinking on this topic.Bolder, happier, smarter: The role of extraversion in positive mood and cognition - ScienceDirectPositive mood induction has contrasting effects on performance which vary according to cognitive task. Less clear is the role of personality and its interactive effects with positive mood on cognition. In the study here, participants (N = 86) completed the EPQ-BV were then randomly assigned to positive (MI-P) or neutral (MI-N) mood induction, and completed three cognitive tasks: creativity, executive function and free recall. As predicted, greater increases in positive mood were found for high compared with low extraverts. In the creativity task, performance improved in the MI-P compared to MI-N condition for high extraverts but not low extraverts. Positive mood impaired free recall performance whilst no differences were found in executive function tasks. These findings are the first to show how stable personality characteristics interacting with positive mood induction contribute to enhance creativity.Expression of emotion in voice and music - ScienceDirectVocal communication of emotion is biologically adaptive for socially living species and has therefore evolved in a phylogenetically continuous manner. Human affect bursts or interjections can be considered close parallels to animal affect vocalizations. The development of speech, unique to the human species, has relied on the voice as a carrier signal, and thus emotion effects on the voice become audible during speech. This article reviews (a) the evidence on listeners' ability to accurately identify a speaker's emotion from voice cues alone, (b) the research efforts trying to isolate the acoustic features that determine listener judgments, and (c) the findings on actual acoustic concomitants of a speaker's emotional state (real or portrayed by actors). Finally, based on speculations about the joint origin of speech and vocal music in nonlinguistic affect vocalizations, similarities of emotion expression in speech and music are discussed.Expression of emotion in voice and music - ScienceDirectThis article represents the written version of a keynote address to the 22nd Annual Symposium on Care of the Professional Voice, Philadelphia, June 7–12, 1993.The distracting effects of vocal and instrumental music on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extraverts - ScienceDirectThis study examined the effects of vocal and instrumental music upon the performance of introverts and extraverts on three cognitive tasks. In the presence of either vocal or instrumental music, or in silence, introverts and extraverts sixth form pupils (N=144) completed a reading comprehension, a logic problem and a coding task. An interaction was predicted such that instrumental music would impair and enhance the test performance of introverts and extraverts, respectively, and that these effects would be magnified in the vocal music condition. No significant interactions were found, although there was a trend for the introverts to be impaired by the introduction of music to the environment and extraverts to be enhanced by it, particularly on the reading and coding tasks. A main effect of extraversion was found in the reading comprehension task and nearly in the coding task (p<0.06). There was a condition effect on the logic task with subjects doing best in the presence of instrumental music. Experimental explanations for the lack of predicted interactions are offered. These findings are discussed with respect to Eysencks theory of personality [Eysenck, H. (1967). The biological basis of personality.

Dowd is Associate Professor of Sociology and Co-director of American Studies at Emory University. Much of his research deals with the sociology of music, examining such issues as the construction of the orchestral canon in the U.S., the extent of diversity in popular music and, more recently, the critical reception of popular music. His research also focuses on the institutionalization of organizational logics and how those logics, in turn, affect such outcomes as career opportunities, organizational foundings, and market construction.Mindfulness meditation in the Israel Defense Forces: Effect on cognition and satisfaction with life–A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectMindfulness meditation (MM) may improve information processing speed (IPS) and quality of life. During intense military training tenacious performance demands may lead to cognitive and emotional distress. We aimed to assess if MM fortifies concentration and affects satisfaction with life.Mindfulness meditation in the Israel Defense Forces: Effect on cognition and satisfaction with life–A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectSoldiers recruited during their professional training at the beginning of their compulsory military service in the Israel Defense Force. Participants (n = 150) were block randomized to either MM or to a military control group (MC).Mindfulness meditation in the Israel Defense Forces: Effect on cognition and satisfaction with life–A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectMM and MC groups were matched for age, education and gender. The MM group attended an 8-week MM course followed by additional 16 weeks of supervised practicing. The primary outcome measure was IPS evaluated by the digit-symbol-substitution-test (DSST) and the secondary measure was satisfaction with life (SWLS).Mindfulness meditation in the Israel Defense Forces: Effect on cognition and satisfaction with life–A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAt the end of the study, data was available for analysis on 65 soldiers in the MM group 65 and 58 in the MC group.

Perception of pain takes place when potential or actual noxious stimuli are appraised as threats of injury. This appraisal is influenced by one's cognitions and emotions based on her/his pain-related experiences, which are processed in the forebrain and limbic areas of the brain. Unarguably, patients' psychological factors such as cognitions (eg, pain catastrophizing), emotions (eg, depression), and pain-related behaviors (eg, avoidance) can influence perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Therefore, hand therapists should address the patient pain experience using a biopsychosocial approach. However, in hand therapy, a biomedical perspective predominates in pain management by focusing solely on tissue healing.Pain-related psychological issues in hand therapy - ScienceDirectThis review aims to raise awareness among hand therapists of the impact of pain-related psychological factors.Pain-related psychological issues in hand therapy - ScienceDirectThis literature review allowed to describe (1) how the neurophysiological mechanisms of pain can be influenced by various psychological factors, (2) several evidence-based interventions that can be integrated into hand therapy to address these psychological issues, and (3) some approaches of psychotherapy for patients with maladaptive pain experiences.Pain-related psychological issues in hand therapy - ScienceDirectRestoration of sensory and motor functions as well as alleviating pain is at the core of hand therapy. Numerous psychological factors including patients' beliefs, cognitions, and emotions alter their pain experience and may impact on their outcomes. Decoding the biopsychosocial components of the patients' pain is thus essential for hand therapists.Pain-related psychological issues in hand therapy - ScienceDirectConflicts of interest: All named authors hereby declare that they have no conflicts of interest to disclose.The current status of the simulation theory of cognition - ScienceDirectIt is proposed that thinking is simulated interaction with the environment. Three assumptions underlie this ‘simulation’ theory of cognitive function. Firstly, behaviour can be simulated in the sense that we can activate motor structures, as during a normal overt action, but suppress its execution. Secondly, perception can be simulated by internal activation of sensory cortex in a way that resembles its normal activation during perception of external stimuli. The third assumption (‘anticipation’) is that both overt and simulated actions can elicit perceptual simulation of their most probable consequences. A large body of evidence, mainly from neuroimaging studies, that supports these assumptions, is reviewed briefly. The theory is ontologically parsimonious and does not rely on standard cognitivist constructs such as internal models or representations. It is argued that the simulation approach can explain the relations between motor, sensory and cognitive functions and the appearance of an inner world. It also unifies and explains important features of a wide variety of cognitive phenomena such as memory and cognitive maps. Novel findings from recent developments in memory research on the similarity of imaging and memory and on the role of both prefrontal cortex and sensory cortex in declarative memory and working memory are predicted by the theory and provide striking support for it.The current status of the simulation theory of cognition - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled “The Cognitive Neuroscience”.Contextualising culture and social cognition - ScienceDirectCognitive neurosciencists have recently begun to study self-consiousness and intersubjectivity but have not yet taken into account adequately the influence of culture on these phenomena. Here, we argue against the naïve inclusion of ‘culture’ as an additional independent factor that can be empirically addressed adequately merely by considering mother tongue or nationality. Instead, we propose that culture needs to be considered as a dynamical system of individuals; that culture is in continous dialectic interaction and exchange with the individuals that constitute it; and that cultural classifications feed back into social practices and identity processes, hence exhibiting a ‘looping effect’. These proposals have important implications for the development of cultural neuroscience.The TTS language for music description - ScienceDirectA language for describing hierarchical music structures in the Twelve Tone system is presented. The language, entitled ‘the Twelve Tone Strings (MS) Language’, is based on temporal combination of Twelve Tone Strings. It is unique in its generality and flexibility; it can be expanded to support many divers musical activities. Twelve Tone Strings can serve as the basic structures of cognitive models, as well as data structures for practical applications, like, typesetting and editing. We claim that it can be used to standardize music description languages. An all purpose music workstation, that is based on the TTS language, might provide a powerful input/output facility for computer research in cognitive musicology and formal theories of music. The music workstation, currently under development in Ben Gurion University, is based on the TTS language.Musical emotions: Functions, origins, evolution - ScienceDirectTheories of music origins and the role of musical emotions in the mind are reviewed. Most existing theories contradict each other, and cannot explain mechanisms or roles of musical emotions in workings of the mind, nor evolutionary reasons for music origins. Music seems to be an enigma. Nevertheless, a synthesis of cognitive science and mathematical models of the mind has been proposed describing a fundamental role of music in the functioning and evolution of the mind, consciousness, and cultures. The review considers ancient theories of music as well as contemporary theories advanced by leading authors in this field. It addresses one hypothesis that promises to unify the field and proposes a theory of musical origin based on a fundamental role of music in cognition and evolution of consciousness and culture. We consider a split in the vocalizations of proto-humans into two types: one less emotional and more concretely-semantic, evolving into language, and the other preserving emotional connections along with semantic ambiguity, evolving into music. The proposed hypothesis departs from other theories in considering specific mechanisms of the mind–brain, which required the evolution of music parallel with the evolution of cultures and languages. Arguments are reviewed that the evolution of language toward becoming the semantically powerful tool of today required emancipation from emotional encumbrances. The opposite, no less powerful mechanisms required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated and refined emotionality. The need for refined music in the process of cultural evolution is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of the mind. This is why today's human mind and cultures cannot exist without today's music. The reviewed hypothesis gives a basis for future analysis of why different evolutionary paths of languages were paralleled by different evolutionary paths of music. Approaches toward experimental verification of this hypothesis in psychological and neuroimaging research are reviewed.Contextualizing bodies: human infants and distributed cognition - ScienceDirectLinking a distributed view of cognition to an integrational perspective on language, learning to talk is presented as an ontogenetic achievement. Examining this as an epigenetic process permits an innovative sketch of how infants come to be heard as producing grammatical utterances. Appealing to ‘shallow’ or content-free cognition, I show how adjustments by contextualizing bodies allow adult overinterpretations to shape infant doings. Far from needing ‘representations’, the baby uses joint activity, affect, and self-directed anticipative learning. Humans, then, use affective co-ordination to develop neurophysiological biases for speaking/hearing vocalizations around syllabic structures. This promotes a kind of agency that allows a 2 year old human, like an encultured bonobo, to act in ways that appear to be self-implicating, self-directing, self-regulating and self-serving. Both species can use (what we hear as) abstracta in novel and coherent behaviour. Unlike its wild counterpart, however, a human needs no external computational hardware. Rather, her achievement derives from strategic use of contextualizing bodies to gradually discover the rewards that accrue from taking part in utterance-activity.On the origins of organology: Franz Joseph Gall and a girl named Bianchi - ScienceDirectFranz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) introduced a new theory of mind and brain at the end of the eighteenth century, which he referred to as organology, dealing with mental functions and their cortical localizations. Gall wrote that observations regarding the verbal learning capacities of his schoolmates brought about his new way of thinking. This widely accepted view, however, requires qualification. Although Gall's experiences and observations as a schoolboy were relevant, especially for his craniology, these childhood memories might have been recalled and reinterpreted after he had started to think about the faculties of mind—specifically after he had met Bianchi, a 5-year-old girl with a special talent for music.The Future of Preschool Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention - ScienceDirectDisclosure: The authors have nothing to disclose.Stages in the evolution of music - ScienceDirectCulture elaborates expressive forms by developing ever more differentiated control over patterns in the expressive medium. In Rank 1 culture (preliterate), music evolves through control over rhythm. Rank 2 culture (literacy) gains control over melodic structure, whereas Rank 3 culture (Renaissance and after) adds harmonic elaboration to rhythm and melody. Within the twentieth century, jazz has followed a similar course, with rhythmic elaboration coming first in traditional jazz, then melodic control emerging in swing, and harmonic control with bop. Both classical music and jazz have much straining beyond the limits of Rank 3 harmonic control, but no clear Rank 4 forms (typified in some aspects by the computer age) have yet evolved.Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectEpilepsy is both a disease of the brain and the mind.Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectFirst of two papers with extended summaries of selected presentationsThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectBased on Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and MindThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectEpilepsy is both a disease of the brain and the mind. Here, we present the first of two papers with extended summaries of selected presentations of the Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind (April 3–5, 2014; Brno, Czech Republic). Epilepsy in history and the arts and its relationships with religion were discussed, as were overviews of epilepsy and relevant aspects of social cognition, handedness, accelerated forgetting and autobiographical amnesia, and large-scale brain networks.Computer music and computer-based musicology - ScienceDirectThe study of music at universities in the U.K. divides into a number of musicological subjects, together with composition, some performing activity and training in advanced musical skills. Various musical applications involving computer-based technology are found in industry, and electroacoustic music is important commercially as well as artistically. Most universities use this technology to teach composition and related topics.Computer music and computer-based musicology - ScienceDirectThe use of computers in teaching musicological subjects is less well advanced, but some work, especially in music analysis, is supported by software. Courseware for musical skills teaching is readily available, though not across the full extent of skills currently studied. Ancillary subjects such as acoustics may be studied through self-paced CAL systems.Computer music and computer-based musicology - ScienceDirectWork in multimedia and intelligent tutoring systems for music has so far been inconclusive. Nonetheless, in general terms, the road to a constructive expansion of CAL in musicology is now becoming clear.Predictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectPredictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectDopamine release in mesolimbic reward circuits leads to reinforcement tied to predictions and outcomes.Predictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectMusical pleasure involves complex interactions between dopamine systems and cortical areas.Predictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectIndividual variability in superior temporal cortex may explain varied musical preferences.Predictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectCognitive, auditory, affective, and reward circuits interact to make music pleasurable.Predictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectMusic has always played a central role in human culture. The question of how musical sounds can have such profound emotional and rewarding effects has been a topic of interest throughout generations. At a fundamental level, listening to music involves tracking a series of sound events over time. Because humans are experts in pattern recognition, temporal predictions are constantly generated, creating a sense of anticipation. We summarize how complex cognitive abilities and cortical processes integrate with fundamental subcortical reward and motivation systems in the brain to give rise to musical pleasure. This work builds on previous theoretical models that emphasize the role of prediction in music appreciation by integrating these ideas with recent neuroscientific evidence.The parietal opercular auditory-sensorimotor network in musicians: A resting-state fMRI study - ScienceDirectThe parietal opercular auditory-sensorimotor network in musicians: A resting-state fMRI study - ScienceDirectMusicians have enhanced connectivity of the auditory-sensorimotor network.The parietal opercular auditory-sensorimotor network in musicians: A resting-state fMRI study - ScienceDirectThe parietal operculum connects the auditory, somatosensory, and motor areas.The parietal opercular auditory-sensorimotor network in musicians: A resting-state fMRI study - ScienceDirectThe enhancement of the functional connectivity is left-lateralized.The parietal opercular auditory-sensorimotor network in musicians: A resting-state fMRI study - ScienceDirectThis network may facilitate auditory-sensorimotor control of musical performance.The parietal opercular auditory-sensorimotor network in musicians: A resting-state fMRI study - ScienceDirectAuditory-sensorimotor coupling is critical for musical performance, during which auditory and somatosensory feedback signals are used to ensure desired outputs. Previous studies reported opercular activation in subjects performing or listening to music. A functional connectivity analysis suggested the parietal operculum (PO) as a connector hub that links auditory, somatosensory, and motor cortical areas. We therefore examined whether this PO network differs between musicians and non-musicians. We analyzed resting-state PO functional connectivity with Heschl’s gyrus (HG), the planum temporale (PT), the precentral gyrus (preCG), and the postcentral gyrus (postCG) in 35 musicians and 35 non-musicians. In musicians, the left PO exhibited increased functional connectivity with the ipsilateral HG, PT, preCG, and postCG, whereas the right PO exhibited enhanced functional connectivity with the contralateral HG, preCG, and postCG and the ipsilateral postCG. Direct functional connectivity between an auditory area (the HG or PT) and a sensorimotor area (the preCG or postCG) did not significantly differ between the groups. The PO’s functional connectivity with auditory and sensorimotor areas is enhanced in musicians relative to non-musicians. We propose that the PO network facilitates musical performance by mediating multimodal integration for modulating auditory-sensorimotor control.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectThree chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectConsiders later-in-life, class discrepant taste formation among hard country fans.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectEthnographic and interview data are used to construct aesthetic trajectories chronicling paths to appreciation.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirect3 types of regulars differentiated by mode of music engagement are identified.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectTrajectories are found to produce structured variations in experience of country, indicating past engagment shapes present taste.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectImplications for studying taste are discussed in light of findings.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectTo date, much social scientific work on taste has relied on Bourdieu’s concept of habitus to account for changes in tastes across the life course. But little empirical work has explored the dynamics of taste formation implied but not explicitly theorized by the concept. Dewey enriches Bourdieu’s work by providing a vocabulary to theorize processes of re-socialization. This paper demonstrates Dewey’s utility for understanding taste development by considering a weekly country event where no taste-class homology exists. The analysis centers on taste trajectories, or paths to appreciation taken by patrons who acquired the ability to appreciate country later-in-life. Data point to three types of regulars (Listeners, Players, Dancers); trajectories produce structured variations in experience, indicating prior engagement shapes present experience of music. Taste and experience are shown to be tightly bound; experience shapes perception and makes individuals into persons capable of having particular tastes.Three chords & [somebody’s] truth: Trajectories of experience and taste among hard country fans - ScienceDirectAlessandra Lembo is a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Chicago. Her research interests include (but are not limited to) the sociology of culture and cognition, the role of the body in perception and thought, and aesthetic, especially musical, experience and response.Implicit Puritanism in American moral cognition - ScienceDirectThree studies provide evidence that the judgments and behaviors of contemporary Americans are implicitly influenced by traditional Puritan-Protestant values regarding work and sex. American participants were less likely to display traditional values regarding sexuality when implicitly primed to deliberate, as opposed to intuition and neutral primes. British participants made judgments reflecting comparatively liberal sexual values regardless of prime condition (Study 1). Implicitly priming words related to divine salvation led Americans, but not Canadians, to work harder on an assigned task (Study 2). Moreover, work and sex values appear linked in an overarching American ethos. Asian-Americans responded to an implicit work prime by rejecting revealing clothing and sexually charged dancing, but only when their American cultural identity was first made salient (Study 3). These effects were observed not only among devout American Protestants, but also non-Protestant and less religious Americans.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectMusic performance anxiety (MPA) is a persistent and distressing experience that involves apprehension linked with musical performance in public (individual or collective). Anxious individuals concentrate their anxiety in situations that involve social scrutiny, favoring distorted, dysfunctional, and negative interpretations of that situation followed by experiences of physiological symptoms associated with the exposure. The most commonly used substances in the pharmacological management of MPA are beta-blockers and benzodiazepines. However, these options are not fully efficient and cause relevant side effects that interfere mainly with performance. Therefore, investigations on alternative substances to treat MPA are highly opportune.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectTo assess the acute effects of oxytocin (OT) on physiological and cognitive variables during an experimental model of simulated performance.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectWe assessed 12 musicians with MPA pre-treated with intranasal OT (24 UI) or placebo in a crossover trial involving an experimental situation of public performance. Cognitive and physiological measures (heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during performance (anticipatory performance anxiety). Statistical analyses were made using Stata Direct.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectThe results showed no effects of OT on physiological symptoms (P > 0.190). In respect to anticipatory anxiety, however, we found a tendency for OT to reduce negative cognitions associated with music performance (P = 0.06). No side effects were reported by musicians throughout the trial.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectThese tendencies, if confirmed through the expansion of the sample, have important implications for the practice of amateur and professional musicians who could benefit from interventions as the one described, possibly with a lesser impact of side effects.Multi-paradigm software environment for the real-time processing of sound, music and multimedia - ScienceDirectThe paper introduces a system and a software architecture for the representation and real-time processing of sound, music, and multimedia based on artificial intelligence techniques. This system, called WinProcne/HARP, is able to represent objects in a two-fold formalism—symbolic and analogical—at different levels of abstraction, and to carry out plans according to the user's goals. It also provides both formal and informal analysis capabilities for extracting information. In WinProcne/HARP the user can build, update, browse, and merge various knowledge bases of sound, music, and multimedia material, as well as enter queries, start and manage real time performance, using a high-level graphical user interface. The system is currently used by researchers and composers in various experiments, including (a) advanced robotics projects, in which the system is used as a tool for interacting, cotrolling and simulating robot movements, and (b) theatrical automation, where the system is delegated to manage and integrate sound, music, and three-dimensional computer animations of humanoid figures. The paper explicitly refers to some applications in the music field.Affective guidance of intelligent agents: How emotion controls cognition - ScienceDirectHow do emotions and moods color cognition? In this article, we examine how such reactions influence both judgments and cognitive performance. We argue that many affective influences are due, not to affective reactions themselves, but to the information they carry about value. The specific kind of influence that occurs depends on the focus of the agent at the time. When making evaluative judgments, for example, an agent’s positive affect may emerge as a positive attitude toward a person or object. But when an agent focuses on a cognitive task, positive affect may act like feedback about the value of one’s approach. As a result, positive affect tends to promote cognitive, relational processes, whereas negative affect tends to inhibit relational processing, resulting in more perceptual, stimulus-specific processing. As a consequence, many textbook phenomena from cognitive psychology occur readily in happy moods, but are inhibited or even absent in sad moods (149).The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectThe effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectDuring naturalistic viewing, suspense suppressed peripheral visual processing.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectSuspense produced increases in the stimulus-driven ventral attention network.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectThere were concurrent decreases in the internally focused default-mode network.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectRecall performance was better for events at high versus low suspense moments.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectWe tested the hypothesis that, during naturalistic viewing, moments of increasing narrative suspense narrow the scope of attentional focus. We also tested how changes in the emotional congruency of the music would affect brain responses to suspense, as well as subsequent memory for narrative events. In our study, participants viewed suspenseful film excerpts while brain activation was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated that suspense produced a pattern of activation consistent with the attention-narrowing hypothesis. For example, we observed decreased activation in the anterior calcarine sulcus, which processes the visual periphery, and increased activity in nodes of the ventral attention network and decreased activity in nodes of the default mode network. Memory recall was more accurate for high suspense than low suspense moments, but did not differ by soundtrack congruency. These findings provide neural evidence that perceptual, attentional, and memory processes respond to suspense on a moment-by-moment basis.Pre-attentive mental processing of music expectation: Event-related potentials of a partially violating and resolving paradigm - ScienceDirectAuditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were investigated in an oddball paradigm to verify electrophysiological evidence of music expectation, which is a key component of artistic presentation. The non-target condition consisted of four-chord harmonic chord sequences, while the target condition was manifested by a partially violating third chord and a resolving fourth chord. The results showed that the specific mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited in the resolving chord is as robust as that elicited in the partially violating chord. Moreover, the P3b (P300) elicited in the resolving chord was smaller than the one in the violating chord. Taken together these data indicates that the human brain pre-attentatively may be able to anticipate a subsequent resolving chord when music expectation is generated by a partially violating chord.Too much control can hurt: A threaded cognition model of the attentional blink - ScienceDirectExplanations for the attentional blink (AB; a deficit in identifying the second of two targets when presented 200–500 ms after the first) have recently shifted from limitations in memory consolidation to disruptions in cognitive control. With a new model based on the threaded cognition theory of multi-tasking we propose a different explanation: the AB is produced by an overexertion of control. This overexertion is produced by a production rule that blocks target detection during memory consolidation. In addition to fitting many known effects in the literature, the model predicts that adding certain secondary tasks will decrease the AB. In Experiment 1, a secondary task is added to the AB task in which participants have to respond to a moving dot. As predicted, AB decreases. Experiment 2 expands this result by controlling for learning, and adds a second variation, rotating the first target. For this variation the model predicts an increase in AB, which is indeed what we found.Too much control can hurt: A threaded cognition model of the attentional blink - ScienceDirectMarc Schipper is currently at the Department of Human Neurobiology, University of Bremen.Effects of individualized music on confused and agitated elderly patients - ScienceDirectThe Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold Model in conjunction with an identified theoretical basis provides a framework for the use of individualized music in individuals with Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DAT). The effects of individualized music is explored in five elderly patients who are confused and agitated and residing in a long-term care facility. The Modified Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory is used to measure the outcome. The immediate and 1-hour residual effects suggest the potential of individualized music as an alternative approach to the management of agitation in confused elderly patients.Skills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectIn this paper we attempt to characterize the key differences and points of convergence between two contemporary approaches to the relationship between culture and cognition in sociology which we label the toolkit and strong practice theory perspectives. We follow recent work at the intersection of culture and cognition in attempting to explicitly formulate the cognitive underpinnings of these two approaches in terms of the assumptions that they make about cultural acquisition, transmission and externalization. Our analysis suggests that in spite of very important differences in emphasis and explanatory range, toolkit and strong practice-theoretical approaches are complementary, although the specific types of modal situation for which each of them is best suited need to be more clearly specified. We develop a framework that shows how the two approaches can be deployed in conjunction as well as specifying the modal settings and situations that each will be more likely to handle best as well as those in which they will run into trouble.Skills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectOmar Lizardo is an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology at University of Notre Dame. His primary research interests are the sociology of culture and globalization, the sociology of knowledge, sociological theory and organizational analysis. But above all, he is interested in all things theoretical. People keep telling him that he should sit down and write a “big book” but so far he continues to resist. His recent empirical work (in collaboration with Steve Vaisey) deals with the effect of moral dispositions on the composition of social networks (Social Forces, forthcoming). He has also published on such topics as the relationship between cognitive neuroscience and practice theory (Theory & Psychology, 2009), the divergent notions of individualism in Spencer and Durkheim (Sociological Perspectives, 2009), and (in collaboration with Jessica Collett) the influence of parental socio-economic status on gender differences in religiosity (Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 2009) as well as the uneven distribution of anger across levels of occupational status (Social Forces, forthcoming).Skills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectMichael Strand is a doctoral student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame. His research interests include the sociology of culture, sociological theory, organizations, and the sociology of knowledge. His paper on the emergence of diagnostic psychiatry received the 2009 Shils-Coleman award for best graduate student paper from the Theory Section of the American Sociological Association. Recent publications include a paper (with Omar Lizardo) dealing with the different faces of Postmodern and Globalization theory across different knowledge-geographical traditions (Protosociology, 2009). Current research projects include the meaning of authenticity among fans of popular music genres, the adoption of poverty initiatives at the World Bank, the concepts of identification and necessity in practice theory, and patterns of participation in extracurricular activities among high school students.The cultural evolution of socially situated cognition - ScienceDirectBecause human cognition is creative and socially situated, knowledge accumulates, diffuses, and gets applied in new contexts, generating cultural analogs of phenomena observed in population genetics such as adaptation and drift. It is therefore commonly thought that elements of culture evolve through natural selection. However, natural selection was proposed to explain how change accumulates despite lack of inheritance of acquired traits, as occurs with template-mediated replication. It cannot accommodate a process with significant retention of acquired or horizontally (e.g. socially) transmitted traits. Moreover, elements of culture cannot be treated as discrete lineages because they constantly interact and influence one another. It is proposed that what evolves through culture is the mind; ideas and artifacts are merely reflections of its current evolved state. Interacting minds transform (in part) through a non-Darwinian autopoietic process similar to that by which early life evolved, involving not survival of the fittest but actualization of their potential.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectAuditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectA neurobiological model for hearing perception in humans is proposed.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectAcoustic-semantic universals are proposed to serve as a form of sound symbolism.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectThe model entails bottom-up signal and top-down grounded cognition theories.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectThe model predicts separable architectures for oral communication and mimesis.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectThe model informs theories of language evolution and of neurodevelopment.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectInteraction with the world is a multisensory experience, but most of what is known about the neural correlates of perception comes from studying vision. Auditory inputs enter cortex with its own set of unique qualities, and leads to use in oral communication, speech, music, and the understanding of emotional and intentional states of others, all of which are central to the human experience. To better understand how the auditory system develops, recovers after injury, and how it may have transitioned in its functions over the course of hominin evolution, advances are needed in models of how the human brain is organized to process real-world natural sounds and “auditory objects”. This review presents a simple fundamental neurobiological model of hearing perception at a category level that incorporates principles of bottom-up signal processing together with top-down constraints of grounded cognition theories of knowledge representation. Though mostly derived from human neuroimaging literature, this theoretical framework highlights rudimentary principles of real-world sound processing that may apply to most if not all mammalian species with hearing and acoustic communication abilities. The model encompasses three basic categories of sound-source: (1) action sounds (non-vocalizations) produced by ‘living things’, with human (conspecific) and non-human animal sources representing two subcategories; (2) action sounds produced by ‘non-living things’, including environmental sources and human-made machinery; and (3) vocalizations (‘living things’), with human versus non-human animals as two subcategories therein. The model is presented in the context of cognitive architectures relating to multisensory, sensory-motor, and spoken language organizations. The models’ predictive values are further discussed in the context of anthropological theories of oral communication evolution and the neurodevelopment of spoken language proto-networks in infants/toddlers. These phylogenetic and ontogenetic frameworks both entail cortical network maturations that are proposed to at least in part be organized around a number of universal acoustic-semantic signal attributes of natural sounds, which are addressed herein.Auditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectA neurobiological model for how the human brain is organized for processing and perceiving real-world, natural sounds.Download high-res image (283KB)Download full-size imageAuditory object perception: A neurobiological model and prospective review - ScienceDirectGuest Editors: Alfonso Caramazza & Marius Peelen.A software architecture for sound and music processing - ScienceDirectThis paper introduces a software architecture for the representation and real-time processing of sound and music, based on Artificial Intelligence techniques. In particular, a system able to store and process music and sounds at different levels of abstraction, and to carry out plans for manipulating this material according to the user's goals is described. This system is able to generate new music pieces as well as manipulate existent ones, on the basis of given material: to this end, it provides also formal analysis capabilities on both music and sounds for extracting information useful in subsequent synthesis processes.A software architecture for sound and music processing - ScienceDirectThis work has been supported by the Progetto Finalizzato Sistemi Informatici e Calcolo Parallelo of the Italian Research Council, under grant no. 90.00716.PF69.Impact of positive and anxious mood on implicit alcohol-related cognitions in internally motivated undergraduate drinkers - ScienceDirectWe explored the impact of musically induced positive and anxious mood on the implicit alcohol-related cognitions of 48 undergraduate students who drink either to enhance positive mood states (EM) or to cope with anxiety (CM-anxiety). Participants completed a post-mood induction computerized alcohol Stroop task that taps implicit alcohol-related cognitions. As hypothesized, CM-anxiety participants in the anxious (but not those in the positive) mood condition showed longer colour-naming latencies for alcohol (vs. non-alcohol) targets (i.e., an attentional bias toward alcohol-related stimuli). Also conforming to expectation was the finding that EM participants in the positive (but not those in the anxious) mood condition displayed longer colour-naming latencies for (i.e., an attentional bias toward) alcohol (vs. non-alcohol) target words.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectTo test for pre-attentive auditory discrimination skills in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectMismatch negativity (MMN) was recorded to test for pre-attentive auditory discrimination skills with a pair of stimuli of /1000 Hz/ and /1100 Hz/, with /1000 Hz/ as the frequent stimulus and /1100 Hz/ as the infrequent stimulus. Onset, offset and peak latencies were the considered latency parameters, whereas peak amplitude and area under the curve were considered for amplitude analysis.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectExactly 50 participants, out of which the experimental group had 25 adult Indian classical vocal musicians and 25 age-matched non-musicians served as the control group, were included in the study. Experimental group participants had a minimum professional music experience in Indian classic vocal music of 10 years. However, control group participants did not have any formal training in music.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectDescriptive statistics showed better waveform morphology in the experimental group as compared to the control. MANOVA showed significantly better onset latency, peak amplitude and area under the curve in the experimental group but no significant difference in the offset and peak latencies between the two groups.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectThe present study probably points towards the enhancement of pre-attentive auditory discrimination skills in Indian classical vocal musicians compared to non-musicians. It indicates that Indian classical musical training enhances pre-attentive auditory discrimination skills in musicians, leading to higher peak amplitude and a greater area under the curve compared to non-musicians.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectTel.: +91 9886833741.Evaluating the impact of social media activities on human brand sales - ScienceDirectBrands spend significant resources on social media to connect with their customers, yet there is limited understanding on how consumers engage with brands on social media and how it influences their purchase process. Drawing on social identity theory which suggests that consumers work hard towards increasing the attractiveness of the groups they belong, we propose that consumers identifying with brands manifest both in-role behaviors that are related to product consumption and extra-role behaviors such as word-of-mouth that benefit the whole group. Accordingly, in the music industry (our empirical context), we propose that consumers engage in three social media activities to enhance the attractiveness of their brands: sampling music (SPLAYS), following music artists (SFANS), and commenting on the artists' social media websites (SWOM). Further, in line with brand attachment theory, we argue that these actions influence consumer purchase behavior (and thus music sales). Results using data for 36 music artists over 73 weeks and robust time-series econometrics provide support for our framework and highlight how the consumer buying process is influenced by social media activities. Specifically, we find some surprising results – the influence of SPLAYS decreases at a decreasing rate, SFANS increases at a decreasing rate, and SWOM increases at an increasing rate. We discuss the implications of our study findings for brand managers and provide recommendations.Evaluating the impact of social media activities on human brand sales - ScienceDirectWe thank leading music industry analytics firm Next Big Sound for providing online consumption data.

We, therefore, predicted that this network would be reorganized via musical training-induced neuroplasticity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting-state functional connectivity of the thalamocortical network in musicians (n = 35) and nonmusicians (n = 35). The seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis of the left thalamus seed showed enhanced connectivity voxels in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in musicians compared with nonmusicians. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional connectivity analysis showed that the auditory areas were also more strongly connected with the left thalamus in musicians. Discriminant analysis using the ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity data of the precuneus/PCC and auditory areas as predictors yielded an 87% correct discrimination of musicians from nonmusicians. Therefore, we can conclude that, as a consequence of long-term musical training, musicians have a characteristically organized thalamocortical network. The precuneus and PCC are principal nodes of the default mode network and play a pivotal role in the manipulation of mental imagery. We propose that the reorganized thalamocortical network in musicians contributes not only to higher sensitivity to sound but also to the integration of mental imagery with sound, which are both presumed to be important for better music performance.Empathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectEmpathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectReview of empathy research in sports, exercise, and performing arts.Empathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectFocus on perception–action links, emotions, and interpersonal processes.Empathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectDiscusses relationships between empathy, embodied cognition, and interdisciplinary approaches.Empathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectThis review article provides a summary of the main findings from empirical studies that used empathy measurements in the domains of sports, exercise, and the performing arts (i.e., music, dance, and theatrical acting).Empathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectThe use of body movement is considered a common denominator across performance domains. Embodied accounts of cognition claim that the capacity to understand an individual's cognitive and affective states depend on the observer's sensorimotor experience and seek to identify the factors influencing this process. To describe the bidirectional links between empathy and performance domains, we divided the empirical studies into two categories: those that investigated factors influencing or inducing empathy, and those that investigated possible influences of empathic tendencies on neurocognitive functions and performance. Therefore, the review includes sections on (1) effects on empathy, including (a) gender, (b) learning and performance, and (c) prosocial contexts; and (2) the effects of empathy on (a) the brain and physiology, (b) perception–performance relations, and (c) prosocial behavior. This work has proven to be informative in unraveling the links between empathy and perceptual-motor processes across intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intergroup levels of analysis.Empathy in sports, exercise, and the performing arts - ScienceDirectThe reported findings are examined in relation to embodied accounts of perceptual-motor performance. Issues related to interdisciplinary dialog, implications for research, and applied practice are also discussed.An essay on the evolution of cognition: Constructing a theoretical conceptual framework - ScienceDirectIn this essay we provide an interdisciplinary approach to the problem of the evolution of human cognition and suggest the theoretical framework of genetic system theory (GST) for organizing the relevant content of several disciplines. This bio-social-cultural theory is based on the assumption that organisms are dynamic systems which interact with one another and their environment and are themselves composed of dynamic internal relations at several levels. Special emphasis will be placed upon these internal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory. The human individual organism is emphasized because in its experiential activity over time it is the site of integration for social, and cultural stimuli and because of its unique properties among living things. The primary disciplines for our discussion are drawn from the biological, social, and humanistic sciences and several concrete examples are given from each science.An on-line method in studying music parsing - ScienceDirectListening to music entails the construction of a mental representation based on partial and ambiguous information. This study examines an experimental method that reflects such parsing decisions on-line by detecting the cognitive load resulting from temporary parsing failures. The method investigated was a divided attention paradigm in which listening to music was the primary task and click detection was a concurrent secondary task. It was hypothesized that increasing the complexity of the primary task by introducing an unprepared chromatic modulation results in an increase in response latencies to a click presented immediately after the modulatory shift. The support of this prediction by musicians' data provides evidence for the sensitivity of the paradigm. The failure of non-musicians to reflect the expected load is attributed to their attention-allocation strategy. These results are discussed in terms of their implications on the view of the musical parser as deterministic.An on-line method in studying music parsing - ScienceDirectThe present study was carried out in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Master's degrees in Psychology and Music of the first author.

The measures were used in a pre/post-test design to examine the effects of engaging older adults in languaging on their cognitive functioning and affect. Each of two researchers engaged each participant in the production of cognitively rich speech through sustained interactions over 10–12 sessions. Results from the three measures were compared to each other and to transcripts of participants' interactions and the researchers' experiences with the participants. The different sources of information supported and contradicted each other in terms of changes observed in the participants' affect and cognitive functioning. We critique the three measures in terms of their adequacy for assessing change and argue that a qualitative, process-oriented approach to assessment that allows it to be integrated with the intervention is better at detecting and understanding change in cognition and affect in older adults.Sensitivity to musical emotions in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectThe emotional experience elicited by music is largely dependent on structural characteristics such as pitch, rhythm, and dynamics. We examine here to what extent amusic adults, who have experienced pitch perception difficulties all their lives, still maintain some ability to perceive emotions from music. Amusic and control participants judged the emotions expressed by unfamiliar musical clips intended to convey happiness, sadness, fear and peacefulness (Experiment 1A). Surprisingly, most amusic individuals showed normal recognition of the four emotions tested here. This preserved ability was not due to some peculiarities of the music, since the amusic individuals showed a typical deficit in perceiving pitch violations intentionally inserted in the same clips (Experiment 1B). In Experiment 2, we tested the use of two major structural determinants of musical emotions: tempo and mode. Neutralization of tempo had the same effect on both amusics' and controls' emotional ratings. In contrast, amusics did not respond to a change of mode as markedly as controls did. Moreover, unlike the control participants, amusics' judgments were not influenced by subtle differences in pitch, such as the number of semitones changed by the mode manipulation. Instead, amusics showed normal sensitivity to fluctuations in energy, to pulse clarity, and to timbre differences, such as roughness. Amusics even showed sensitivity to key clarity and to large mean pitch differences in distinguishing happy from sad music. Thus, the pitch perception deficit experienced by amusic adults had only mild consequences on emotional judgments. In sum, emotional responses to music may be possible in this condition.Sensitivity to musical emotions in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectAll authors contributed equally to the work.The feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectThe feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectSinging had no detrimental effect on velocity, cadence, or stride length.The feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectSinging positively affected gait variability.The feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectA verbal dual-task condition slowed and destabilized gait, whereas singing did not.The feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectSinging holds promise as an effective cueing technique for people with PD.The feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectBrain regions important for controlling movement are also responsible for rhythmic processing. In Parkinson disease (PD), defective internal timing within the brain has been linked to impaired beat discrimination, and may contribute to a loss of ability to maintain a steady gait rhythm. Less rhythmic gait is inherently less efficient, and this may lead to gait impairment including reduced speed, cadence, and stride length, as well as increased variability. While external rhythmic auditory stimulation (e.g. a metronome beat) is well-established as an effective tool to stabilize gait in PD, little is known about whether self-generated cues such as singing have the same beneficial effect on gait in PD. Thus, we compared gait patterns of 23 people with mild to moderate PD under five cued conditions: uncued, music only, singing only, singing with music, and a verbal dual-task condition. In our single-session study, singing while walking did not significantly alter velocity, cadence, or stride length, indicating that it was not excessively demanding for people with PD. In addition, walking was less variable when singing than during other cued conditions. This was further supported by the comparison between singing trials and a verbal dual-task condition. In contrast to singing, the verbal dual-task negatively affected gait performance. These findings suggest that singing holds promise as an effective cueing technique that may be as good as or better than traditional cueing techniques for improving gait among people with PD.Prayer, cognition, and culture - ScienceDirectReligious texts, symbols, and practices have long been recognized as important aspects of culture, and yet they are less often the focus of empirical observation than are crude indicators obtained in surveys (such as religious preference and attendance). Prayer is one such topic: widely practiced, and yet treated mostly without regard to its cognitive content or cultural framing. Eleven empirical studies are presented here which examine prayers and prayer-related aspects of religion in contexts including advocacy groups, hospitals, congregations, the Internet, homilies in mosques, religious television, children's books, art, testimonials, inspirational guides, and interviews. The studies illuminate methods and data for studying cultural content of these kinds and draw connections with recent work in cognitive sociology and cognitive anthropology.Prayer, cognition, and culture - ScienceDirectRobert Wuthnow is Andlinger Professor of Sociology and Director of the Center for the Study of Religion at Princeton University. His recent publications include America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity (Princeton University Press, 2005) and After the Baby Boomers: How Twenty- and Thirty-Somethings Are Shaping the Future of American Religion (Princeton University Press, 2007).Are there pre-existing neural, cognitive, or motoric markers for musical ability? - ScienceDirectAdult musician’s brains show structural enlargements, but it is not known whether these are inborn or a consequence of long-term training. In addition, music training in childhood has been shown to have positive effects on visual–spatial and verbal outcomes. However, it is not known whether pre-existing advantages in these skills are found in children who choose to study a musical instrument nor is it known whether there are pre-existing associations between music and any of these outcome measures that could help explain the training effects. To answer these questions, we compared 5- to 7-year-olds beginning piano or string lessons (n = 39) with 5- to 7-year-olds not beginning instrumental training (n = 31). All children received a series of tests (visual–spatial, non-verbal reasoning, verbal, motor, and musical) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. We found no pre-existing neural, cognitive, motor, or musical differences between groups and no correlations (after correction for multiple analyses) between music perceptual skills and any brain or visual–spatial measures. However, correlations were found between music perceptual skills and both non-verbal reasoning and phonemic awareness. Such pre-existing correlations suggest similarities in auditory and visual pattern recognition as well a sharing of the neural substrates for language and music processing, most likely due to innate abilities or implicit learning during early development. This baseline study lays the groundwork for an ongoing longitudinal study addressing the effects of intensive musical training on brain and cognitive development, and making it possible to look retroactively at the brain and cognitive development of those children who emerge showing exceptional musical talent.A developmental study of the affective value of tempo and mode in music - ScienceDirectDo children use the same properties as adults in determining whether music sounds happy or sad? We addressed this question with a set of 32 excerpts (16 happy and 16 sad) taken from pre-existing music. The tempo (i.e. the number of beats per minute) and the mode (i.e. the specific subset of pitches used to write a given musical excerpt) of these excerpts were modified independently and jointly in order to measure their effects on happy–sad judgments. Adults and children from 3 to 8 years old were required to judge whether the excerpts were happy or sad. The results show that as adults, 6–8-year-old children are affected by mode and tempo manipulations. In contrast, 5-year-olds' responses are only affected by a change of tempo. The youngest children (3–4-year-olds) failed to distinguish the happy from the sad tone of the music above chance. The results indicate that tempo is mastered earlier than mode to infer the emotional tone conveyed by music.Are we “experienced listeners”? A review of the musical capacities that do not depend on formal musical training - ScienceDirectThe present paper reviews a set of studies designed to investigate different aspects of the capacity for processing Western music. This includes perceiving the relationships between a theme and its variations, perceiving musical tensions and relaxations, generating musical expectancies, integrating local structures in large-scale structures, learning new compositional systems and responding to music in an emotional (affective) way. The main focus of these studies was to evaluate the influence of intensive musical training on these capacities. The overall set of data highlights that some musical capacities are acquired through exposure to music without the help of explicit training. These capacities reach such a degree of sophistication that they enable untrained listeners to respond to music as “musically experienced listeners” do.Are we “experienced listeners”?

This review aimed to evaluate strategies to support adherence among people with MCI or Dementia and was completed in Nottingham/UK in 2017. A narrative synthesis was used to investigate the effectiveness or usefulness of adherence support strategies. Fifteen adherence support strategies were used including theoretical underpinning (programmes based on behavior change theories), individual tailoring, worksheets and exercise booklets, goal setting, phone calls or reminders, newsletters, support to overcome exercise barriers, information, adaptation periods, individual supervision, support for clinicians, group setting, music, accelerometers/pedometers and emphasis on enjoyable activities. Music was the only strategy that was investigated in a comparative design but was found to be effective only for those who were generally interested in participating in activities. A wide range of adherence support strategies are being included in exercise interventions for people with MCI or dementia, but the evidence regarding their effectiveness is limited.Sexual arousal and rhythmic synchronization: A possible effect of vasopressin - ScienceDirectMusic is ubiquitous. Yet, its biological relevance is still an ongoing debate. Supporting the view that music had an ancestral role in courtship displays, a pilot study presented here provides preliminary evidence on the link between music and sexual selection. The underlying hypothesis is based on the fact that the sexually dimorphic neuropeptide vasopressin has its receptors in the part of the brain involved in music and dance performance (the basal ganglia), and its concentrations rise during sexual arousal in men. In addition, music, dance, and courtship phenotypes seem to be in part regulated by vasopressin and its genes. Hence, to test this hypothesis, a rhythmic synchronization task was employed here on one male subject during sexual arousal. Results revealed a significant effect of sexual arousal on rhythm synchronization. This is the first report that empirically supports the hypothesis on the role of music in sexual selection. Further studies are clearly required.Neural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectNeural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectSubjects made valence inferences of stimuli with different levels of dissonance.Neural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectConsonance/dissonance degree modulated responses on the right angular gyrus.Neural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectDissonance demanded heightened ‘theory of mind’ and attention reorienting resources.Neural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectSocial skills traits associated with deficits in valence appraisal of consonances.Neural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectWe frequently infer others’ intentions based on non-verbal auditory cues. Although the brain underpinnings of social cognition have been extensively studied, no empirical work has yet examined the impact of musical structure manipulation on the neural processing of emotional valence during mental state inferences. We used a novel sound-based theory-of-mind paradigm in which participants categorized stimuli of different sensory dissonance level in terms of positive/negative valence. Whilst consistent with previous studies which propose facilitated encoding of consonances, our results demonstrated that distinct levels of consonance/dissonance elicited differential influences on the right angular gyrus, an area implicated in mental state attribution and attention reorienting processes. Functional and effective connectivity analyses further showed that consonances modulated a specific inhibitory interaction from associative memory to mental state attribution substrates. Following evidence suggesting that individuals with autism may process social affective cues differently, we assessed the relationship between participants’ task performance and self-reported autistic traits in clinically typical adults. Higher scores on the social cognition scales of the AQ were associated with deficits in recognising positive valence in consonant sound cues. These findings are discussed with respect to Bayesian perspectives on autistic perception, which highlight a functional failure to optimize precision in relation to prior beliefs.Neural mechanisms underlying valence inferences to sound: The role of the right angular gyrus - ScienceDirectInstitutions at which the work was performed: University of Cambridge and TU Dresden.Does domain knowledge moderate involvement of working memory capacity in higher-level cognition? A test of three models - ScienceDirectResearch suggests that both working memory capacity and domain knowledge contribute to individual differences in higher-level cognition. This study evaluated three hypotheses concerning the interplay between these factors. The compensation hypothesis predicts that domain knowledge attenuates the influence of working memory capacity on higher-level cognition, whereas the rich-get-richer hypothesis predicts that working memory capacity enhances use of domain knowledge. The independent influences hypothesis states simply that working memory capacity and domain knowledge make additive contributions to higher-level cognition. Participants representing wide ranges of working memory capacity and knowledge of baseball performed tasks that emphasized keeping track of information in a dynamic environment. The baseball task involved tracking the movements of baseball players on a baseball diamond. The spaceship task was structurally isomorphic to this task but its content was arbitrary. Results revealed greater use of baseball knowledge in the baseball task than in the spaceship task. However, even at high levels of baseball knowledge, this knowledge use did not alter the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance. This finding is inconsistent with compensation and rich-get-richer hypotheses. Instead, it suggests that working memory capacity and domain knowledge may operate independently under certain conditions.Does domain knowledge moderate involvement of working memory capacity in higher-level cognition?

Such operation of flagship stores is one means of forward verticalization. From samples of visitors to two flagship stores of fast-moving consumer goods brands, this study analyzes the effects of the flagship store visit on brand experience, brand equity, brand attachment, and loyalty. In the low-involvement FMCG context, flagship stores are useful for reinforcing brand experience. However, flagship store-fueled brand experience does not necessarily lead to favorable consumer reactions; its effect on future purchases is mediated by both brand equity and brand attachment.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectThe behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectA recent appreciation of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has emerged.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectThis review probes recent examinations of the relationship between dFC and cognition.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectPromising directions include cognitive/clinical relevance and computational modeling.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectRecent advances in neuroimaging methods and analysis have led to an expanding body of research that investigates how large-scale brain network organization dynamically adapts to changes in one's environment, including both internal state changes and external stimulation. It is now possible to detect changes in functional connectivity that occur on the order of seconds, both during an unconstrained resting state and during the performance of constrained cognitive tasks. It is thought that these dynamic, time-varying changes in functional connectivity, often referred to as dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), include features that are relevant to behavior and cognition. This review summarizes four aspects of the nascent literature directly testing that assumption: 1) how changes in functional network organization on the order of task blocks relate to differences in task demands and to cognitive ability; 2) how differences in dFC variability between different contexts relate to cognitive demands and behavioral performance; 3) how ongoing fluctuations in dFC impact perception and attention; and 4) how different patterns of dFC correspond to individual differences in cognition. The review ends by discussing promising directions for future research in this field. First, it comments on how dFC analyses can help to elucidate the mechanisms of healthy cognition. Next, it describes how dFC processes may be disrupted in disease, and how probing such dysfunction can increase understanding of neural etiology, as well as behavioral and cognitive impairments, observed in psychiatric and neurologic populations. Last, it considers the potential for computational models to uncover neuronal mechanisms of dFC, and how both healthy cognition and disease emerge from network dynamics.Children’s descriptive-to-prescriptive tendency replicates (and varies) cross-culturally: Evidence from China - ScienceDirectResearch with U.S. samples found that children use descriptive group regularities (characteristics shared by individuals within a group) to generate prescriptive judgments (characteristics that should be shared by individuals within a group). Here, we assessed this descriptive-to-prescriptive tendency in a sample of children (ages 4–13 years) and adults (ages 18–40 years) from mainland China. Participants were introduced to novel groups (i.e., Hibbles and Glerks) who engaged in contrasting morally neutral behaviors (e.g., listening to different kinds of music) and then to conforming and non-conforming individuals (e.g., a Hibble who listened to music more typical of Glerks). Like U.S. children, Chinese children disapproved of non-conformity and rates of disapproval declined with age. However, compared with U.S. children, younger Chinese children (ages 4–6 years) rated non-conformity more disapprovingly, and unlike U.S. adults, Chinese adults rated non-conformity more negatively than conformity. Moreover, compared with U.S. participants, Chinese participants across all age groups appealed more often to norm-based explanations when justifying their disapproval. These data provide a cross-cultural replication of children’s descriptive-to-prescriptive tendency but also reveal cross-cultural variation, and they have implications for understanding the mechanisms that underlie stereotyping and normative reasoning.The evolution of music—A comparison of Darwinian and dialectical methods - ScienceDirectMusic provides a challenging system for the analysis of cultural evolution. The dialectical approach to music seeks to identify the internal stylistic tensions and contradictions (in terms of thesis and antithesis) which give rise to new musical forms (synthesis). The Darwinian alternative to dialectics, which in its most reductionist form is becoming known as memetics, seeks to interpret the evolution of music by examining the adaptiveness of its various component parts in the selective environment of culture. This essay compares the memetic and dialectical approaches with special reference to the development of jazz in the era of recorded sound, in the light of Benzon's classification of musical styles into evolutionary Ranks (Benzon, 1993). This essay concludes that the basic postulate of memetics is falsifiable and therefore that memetics qualifies as scientific in the Popperian sense, rather than being simply a pseudo-scientific meta-narrative for cultural evolution. Some suggestions for empirical analysis are provided. In contrast, the dialectical perspective is not scientific in the Popperian sense, but does provide a good explanatory framework for the history of jazz in the years 1900–1970, and shows how transitions between “ranks” (from Benzon) may be generated. However, dialectics is considerably less successful in the construction of a model to explain the period since 1970.The evolution of music—A comparison of Darwinian and dialectical methods - ScienceDirectDerek Gatherer, Ph.D., currently lectures in the School of Biomolecular Sciences at Liverpool John Moores University, and pursues research interests in the molecular evolution of DNA sequences and cultural evolution using the gene/meme analogy.

To probe the nature and development of space-pitch mappings, we tested 5- to 7-year-olds and adults (N = 69), who heard pitch intervals and were asked to choose the corresponding spatial representation. Results showed that children and adults both mapped pitches continuously onto space, although effects were stronger in older than younger children. Additionally, children’s spatial and numerical skills were tested, showing a relation between children’s spatial and pitch-matching skills, and between their spatial and numerical skills. However, pitch and number were not related, suggesting spatial underpinnings for pitch and number.Where music meets space: Children’s sensitivity to pitch intervals is related to their mental spatial transformation skills - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16801, United States.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectWhile there is sustained effort to refine the models and to further decrypt the neuronal underpinnings of cerebral music perception, empirical investigations on the associations of music perception with diagnoses others than focal brain damage need to be amplified.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectIn the present study, a validated and standardized clinical test of musical ability was applied to a sample of severely depressed patients. Basic musical capacities of rhythm, melody and pitch perception, recognition of emotions, and musical memory were evaluated and compared to matched healthy controls and reassessed in a follow-up examination after clinical remission.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectWe enroled 21 in-patients with major depression according to ICD-10 (F32 and F33). The score in the test of musical ability (maximum score 70) was 52.3±7.8 for the patient group and 57.8±4.3 for the control group (p=0.010). In particular, melody comparison, rhythm perception, and emotional categorising of music were impaired in patients. In the longitudinal study, patients improved from 53.6±7.8 to 56.2±6.7 (p=0.038); this improvement could be related to clinical improvement on the Hamilton Depression Scale.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe sample size is small, in particular in the follow-up study.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe results clearly revealed a significant reduction of musical ability in patients with depression. A part of the patients could even be diagnosed with a clinically relevant amusia. Along with significant decrease of depressive symptoms, the patients significantly improved with respect to musical ability. These findings suggest a systematic impact of depression on musical ability, they are of importance for the application of music therapy in depressive patients and for the function of music to improve their quality of life.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectTheory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectYoung remitted bipolar patients show decoding deficits in ecologically valid stimuli.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectRemitted bipolar patients show no reasoning deficits.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectMood induction deteriorates ToM reasoning in bipolar patients and healthy controls.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectTo date, research concerning Theory of Mind (ToM) in remitted bipolar disorder (rBD) has yielded inconclusive results. This may be a result of methodological shortcomings and the failure to consider relevant third variables. Furthermore, studies using ecologically valid stimuli are rare. This study examines ToM in rBD patients, using ecologically valid stimuli. Additionally, the effects of sad mood induction (MI) as well as of age and gender are considered.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectThe sample comprises N = 44 rBD patients (rBDPs) and N = 40 healthy controls (HCs). ToM decoding is assessed using the Cambridge Mindreading Face-Voice-Battery (CAM) and ToM reasoning using the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC). Both tasks were divided into two parts to conduct one part with and one without MI.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectWhile across the whole sample there was no evidence that rBDPs and HCs differed in ToM decoding or reasoning, in the younger subsample (age < 45) rBDPs performed worse than HCs in ToM decoding. While MI negatively influenced reasoning in both groups, gender had no effect.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectMost patients in this study had a high level of social functioning, limiting the generalizability of the results.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectAs important social steps have to be undertaken before middle-age, the decoding deficits in younger rBDPs might be of particular importance not only for social functioning but also for the course of illness. Furthermore, this age-related deficit may explain the inconclusive findings that have been reported so far.Impact of ambient odors on mall shoppers' emotions, cognition, and spending: A test of competitive causal theories - ScienceDirectThe authors tested the effect of ambient scents in a shopping mall environment. Two competing models were used. The first model is derived from the environmental psychology research stream by Mehrabian and Russel (1974) and Donovan and Rossiter (1982) where atmospheric cues generate pleasure and arousal, and, in turn, an approach/avoidance behavior. The emotion–cognition model is supported by Zajonc and Markus (1984). The second model to be tested is based on Lazarus' (1991) cognitive theory of emotions. In this latter model, shoppers' perceptions of the retail environment and product quality mediate the effects of ambient scent cues on emotions and spending behaviors. Positive affect is enhanced from shoppers' evaluations. Using structural equation modeling the authors conclude that the cognitive theory of emotions better explains the effect of ambient scent. Managerial implications are discussed.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectLifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectHigher antipsychotic exposure related to poorer cognition in midlife schizophrenia.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectPotential biases related to this naturalistic design may contribute to the effects.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectHigher antipsychotic doses may negatively affect cognitive course in schizophrenia.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectPreventing or attenuating cognitive recovery may be an explanation for the results.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectThis naturalistic study analysed the association between cumulative lifetime antipsychotic dose and cognition in schizophrenia after an average of 16.5 years of illness. Sixty participants with schizophrenia and 191 controls from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 were assessed at age 43 years with a neurocognitive test battery. Cumulative lifetime antipsychotic dose-years were collected from medical records and interviews. The association between antipsychotic dose-years and a cognitive composite score based on principal component analysis was analysed using linear regression. Higher lifetime antipsychotic dose-years were significantly associated with poorer cognitive composite score, when adjusted for gender, onset age and lifetime hospital treatment days. The effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics did not differ. This is the first report of an association between cumulative lifetime antipsychotic dose and global cognition in midlife schizophrenia. Based on these data, higher lifetime antipsychotic dose-years may be associated with poorer cognitive performance at age 43 years. Potential biases related to the naturalistic design may partly explain the results; nonetheless, it is possible that large antipsychotic doses harm cognition in schizophrenia in the long-term.Event-related potentials, cognition, and behavior: A biological approach - ScienceDirectThe prevailing cognitive-psychological accounts of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) assume that ERP components manifest information processing operations leading from stimulus to response. Since this view encounters numerous difficulties already analyzed in previous studies, an alternative view is presented here that regards cortical control of behavior as a repetitive sensorimotor cycle consisting of two phases: (i) feedforward anticipation and (ii) feedback cortical performance. This view allows us to interpret in an integrative manner numerous data obtained from very different domains of ERP studies: from biophysics of ERP waves to their relationship to the processing of language, in which verbal behavior is viewed as likewise controlled by the same two basic control processes: feedforward (hypothesis building) and feedback (hypothesis checking). The proposed approach is intentionally simplified, explaining numerous effects on the basis of few assumptions and relating several levels of analysis: neurophysiology, macroelectrical processes (i.e. ERPs), cognition and behavior. It can, therefore, be regarded as a first approximation to a general theory of ERPs.Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study - ScienceDirectRecent evidence on amusia suggests that our ability to perceive music might be based on the same neural resources that underlie other higher cognitive functions, such as speech perception and spatial processing. We studied the neural correlates of acquired amusia by performing extensive neuropsychological assessments on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke. In addition, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on all patients 1 week and 6 months post-stroke. Based on their performance on a shortened version of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), the patients were classified as amusic (n = 32) or non-amusic (n = 21). MRI results showed that the incidence of auditory cortex and frontal lobe damage was significantly higher in the amusic group than in the non-amusic group, but the two groups did not differ in respect to lesion laterality. Cognitively, amusia was associated with general deficits in working memory and learning, semantic fluency, executive functioning, and visuospatial cognition, as well as hemisphere-specific deficits in verbal comprehension, mental flexibility, and visuospatial attention (unilateral spatial neglect). Moreover, the recovery of music perception ability was related to the recovery of verbal learning, visuospatial perception and attention, and focused attention, especially in amusic patients. Together, these results suggest the ability to perceive music is closely linked to other higher cognitive functions.Mood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectMood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectCommunicators in a negative mood employed more flattery, conformity and self-promotionMood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectIngratiating messages written in a negative mood were more effectiveMood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectNegative mood enhanced recipients' acceptance of ingratiationMood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectReaction times and recall data confirmed the more attentive processing in negative moodMood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectMediational analysis found that more attentive processing was linked to the improved production and reception of ingratiationMood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectCan mood influence the way people produce and respond to ingratiating messages? Based on recent affect-cognition theories we demonstrate for the first time that mild negative mood increased communicators' use of ingratiatory tactics such as flattery, conformity and self-promotion (Exp. 1). Experiment 2 further confirmed that ingratiatory messages written in a negative mood were more effective and resulted in more positive interpersonal evaluations than messages written in a positive mood. Experiment 3 found that negative mood also improved recipients' willingness to accept realistic ingratiation. An analysis of response latencies (Exps. 1 and 3) and recall (Exp. 3), and mediational analyses showed that these effects were consistent with negative mood promoting longer and more attentive processing by both senders and recipients. The theoretical implications of these results for recent affect-cognition theories are considered, and the practical implications of these findings for everyday strategic communication and interpersonal behavior are discussed.Mood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectSupport from the Australian Research Council to Joseph Forgas is gratefully acknowledged.The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to determine whether preferences for enhanced and exaggerated bass in popular and more traditional forms of music are related to personality and gender differences. To test hypothesized relationships 21 pairs of musical selections were presented to undergraduate volunteers. Selections were randomly played in either normal or in enhanced bass modes. Personality was measured with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Revised, with Ss included in analysis if they scored in the highest or lowest quartile of the three superfactors measured by this instrument. Results showed that Psychoticism, gender, and Extraversion are all positively related to preference for enhanced bass. The results of gender are maintained even if the tendency for elevated Pscores in males are statistically controlled. Potential biobehavioural explanations for these findings are discussed as well as directions for future research.Music processing at L.I.M. - ScienceDirectThis paper is a brief overview of the research and didactic activities of the Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale (L.I.M.) of the University of Milan. The main goals at L.I.M. are the definition of formal methods and the implementation of software and hardware tools to process music (both in real time and in interactive mode) at various abstraction levels.The effects of music, wait-length evaluation, and mood on a low-cost wait experience - ScienceDirectWaiting time research has implicitly assumed customers incur high waiting costs during service delays. However, few studies have explicitly measured customer perceptions of waiting costs. Our study examined the effects of judgment about music, wait-length evaluation, and customer mood on subjects' overall experience evaluations in a low-cost wait situation. Results showed that while music likeability influenced both wait-length evaluation and mood, only mood contributed to subjects' evaluation of their overall experience. Implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectA comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectSongbirds and humans showed opposite results: with humans good at pitch height and humans good at pitch chroma perception.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectPositive controls ruled out trivial methodological interpretations of the results.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectApplying a modular approach to note durations and relative pitch in addition to pitch height and chroma perception expanded the discussion.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectA modular approach was used to assert the independence of these perceptual abilities.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectDifferences were attributed to phylogenetic causation.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectWe propose that a relatively small number of perceptual skills underlie human perception of music and speech. Humans and songbirds share a number of features in the development of their auditory communication systems. These similarities invite comparisons between species in their auditory perceptual skills. Here, we summarized our experimental comparisons between humans (and other mammals) and songbirds (and other birds) in their use of pitch height and pitch chroma perception and discuss similarities and differences in other auditory perceptual abilities of these species. Specifically, we introduced a functional modular view, using pitch chroma and pitch height perception as examples, as a theoretical framework for the comparative study of auditory perception and perhaps all of the study of comparative cognition. We also contrasted phylogeny and adaptation as causal mechanisms in comparative cognition using examples from auditory perception.Beethoven’s last piano sonata and those who follow crocodiles: Cross-domain mappings of auditory pitch in a musical context - ScienceDirectThough auditory pitch is customarily mapped in Western cultures onto spatial verticality (high–low), both anthropological reports and cognitive studies suggest that pitch may be mapped onto a wide variety of other domains. We collected a total number of 35 pitch mappings and investigated in four experiments how these mappings are used and structured. In particular, we inquired (1) how Western subjects apply Western and non-Western metaphors to “high” and “low” pitches, (2) whether mappings applied in an abstract conceptual task are similarly applied by listeners to actual music, (3) how mappings of spatial height relate to these pitch mappings, and (4) how mappings of “high” and “low” pitch associate with other dimensions, in particular quantity, size, intensity and valence. The results show strong agreement among Western participants in applying familiar and unfamiliar metaphors for pitch, in both an abstract, conceptual task (Exp. 1) and in a music listening task (Exp. 2), indicating that diverse cross-domain mappings for pitch exist latently besides the common verticality metaphor. Furthermore, limited overlap between mappings of spatial height and pitch height was found, suggesting that, the ubiquity of the verticality metaphor in Western usage notwithstanding, cross-domain pitch mappings are largely independent of that metaphor, and seem to be based upon other underlying dimensions. Part of the discrepancy between spatial height and pitch height is that, for pitch, “up” is not necessarily “more,” nor is it necessarily “good.” High pitch is only “more” for height, intensity and brightness. It is “less” for mass, size and quantity. We discuss implications of these findings for music and speech prosody, and their relevance to notions of embodied cognition and of cross-domain magnitude representation.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectWhy epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectPeople with epilepsy are at risk for reduced social competences and quality of life.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectNeuropsychological deficits in social cognition may impede social interactions.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectNew diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are needed for better assessment and care.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectSocial bonds are at the center of our daily living and are an essential determinant of our quality of life. In people with epilepsy, numerous factors can impede cognitive and affective functions necessary for smooth social interactions. Psychological and psychiatric complications are common in epilepsy and may hinder the processing of social information. In addition, neuropsychological deficits such as slowed processing speed, memory loss or attentional difficulties may interfere with enjoyable reciprocity of social interactions. We consider societal, psychological, and neuropsychological aspects of social life with particular emphasis on socio-cognitive functions in temporal lobe epilepsy. Deficits in emotion recognition and theory of mind, two main aspects of social cognition, are frequently observed in individuals with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Results from behavioural studies targeting these functions will be presented with a focus on their relevance for patients’ daily life. Furthermore, we will broach the issue of pitfalls in current diagnostic tools and potential directions for future research. By giving a broad overview of individual and interpersonal determinants of social functioning in epilepsy, we hope to provide a basis for future research to establish social cognition as a key component in the comprehensive assessment and care of those with epilepsy.Taking stock of cognition enhancers - ScienceDirectAn increasing number of structurally heterogeneous compounds, which may act via very different categories of neuronal mechanisms, have been proposed to facilitate attentional abilities and acquisition, storage and retrieval of information, and/or to attenuate the impairements of such cognitive functions associated with age or dementia. In this article, Martin Sarter briefly reviews the data on putative cognition enhancers and examines the possible bases for the discrepancy between preclinical predictions of efficacy and the fact that unequivocal demonstration of drug-induced cognition enhancement in humans has only rarely been reported. Previous preclinical research strategies appear to have focused on the demonstration of drug effects in a wide variety of tests of uncertain validity, rather than on determination of the specific psychological and neurobiological processes affected by putative cognition enhancers. Some criteria are proposed for evaluating the validity of preclinical tests for cognition enhancers.Dynamics of the knowledge instinct: Effects of incoherence on the cognitive system - ScienceDirectWe successfully replicated a study about aesthetic emotions in a different socio-cultural environment. The present results suggest that incoherence is a strong inhibitor for aesthetic chills and verify a positive correlation between pleasure and meaning. These results allow for a scientific study of aesthetic emotions as it is now possible for the experimenter to have two groups of subjects, both exposed to the same stimulation, one group experiencing measurable aesthetic emotions whereas the other does not. We review the literature on the problem of both positive and negative psychogenic shivering and relate this phenomenon to the instinct of knowledge. We discuss the implications of our findings, stress the importance of studying the psychological and physiological effects of incoherence on the central nervous system, introduce a series of hypotheses to be tested in further research and conclude with a plausible explanation for the relation between temperature and cognition in humans.The role of pitch and temporal diversity in the perception and production of musical sequences - ScienceDirectIn two experiments we explored how the dimensions of pitch and time contribute to the perception and production of musical sequences. We tested how dimensional diversity (the number of unique categories in each dimension) affects how pitch and time combine. In Experiment 1, 18 musically trained participants rated the complexity of sequences varying only in their diversity in pitch or time; a separate group of 18 pianists reproduced these sequences after listening to them without practice. Overall, sequences with more diversity were perceived as more complex, but pitch diversity influenced ratings more strongly than temporal diversity. Further, although participants perceived sequences with high levels of pitch diversity as more complex, errors were more common in the sequences with higher diversity in time. Sequences in Experiment 2 exhibited diversity in both pitch and time; diversity levels were a subset of those tested in Experiment 1. Again diversity affected complexity ratings and errors, but there were no statistical interactions between dimensions. Nonetheless, pitch diversity was the primary factor in determining perceived complexity, and again temporal errors occurred more often than pitch errors. Additionally, diversity in one dimension influenced error rates in the other dimension in that both error types were more frequent relative to Experiment 1. These results suggest that although pitch and time do not interact directly, they are nevertheless not processed in an informationally encapsulated manner. The findings also align with a dimensional salience hypothesis, in which pitch is prioritised in the processing of typical Western musical sequences.The influence of music on consumers' temporal perceptions: Does time fly when you're having fun? - ScienceDirectThe perceived duration of a time period may be influenced by properties of environmental stimuli that fill the period. Because music is often present in consumer environments, we conducted an experiment to explore the influence of a musical stimulus property (modality) on listeners' estimates of the duration of a time period. Findings suggest that perceptions of duration are influenced by music in a way that contradicts conventional wisdom (i.e., the "time flies when you're having fun" hypothesis). Perceived duration was longest for subjects exposed to positively valenced (major key) music, and shortest for negatively valenced (atonal) music. Thus, time did not fly when an interval was filled with affectively positive stimulation. An alternative hypothesis based on attentional and retrieval processes is supported. Implications for the design of consumer environments and for future research are discussed.An Associative Memorization Architecture of Extracted Musical Features from Audio Signals by Deep Learning Architecture - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we develop associative memorization architecture of the musical features from time sequential data of the music audio signals. This associative memorization architecture is constructed by using deep learning architecture. Challenging purpose of our research is the development of the new composition system that automatically creates a new music based on some existing music. How does a human composer make musical compositions or pieces? Generally speaking, music piece is generated by the cyclic analysis process and re-synthesis process of musical features in music creation procedures. This process can be simulated by learning models using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The first and critical problem is how to describe the music data, because, in those models, description format for this data has a great influence on learning performance and function. Almost of related works adopt symbolic representation methods of music data. However, we believe human composers never treat a music piece as a symbol. Therefore raw music audio signals are input to our system. The constructed associative model memorizes musical features of music audio signals, and regenerates sequential data of that music. Based on experimental results of memorizing music audio data, we verify the performances and effectiveness of our system.An Associative Memorization Architecture of Extracted Musical Features from Audio Signals by Deep Learning Architecture - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of Missouri University of Science and Technology.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectThe art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectWe examined the impact of arts-integrated Head Start preschool on school readiness.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectOverall, arts-integrated Head Start related to an advantage in school readiness.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectArts integration related to greater gains on a school readiness composite.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectArts integration related to greater gains in self/social awareness.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectArts integration also related to greater gains in understanding texture/material.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectThe present study examined the impact of intensive arts integration on school readiness for economically disadvantaged children attending Head Start preschool. Participants were 265 children, ages 3–5 years. Of these, 197 attended a fully arts-integrated Head Start, where children received daily music, dance, and visual arts classes in addition to homeroom, and 68 attended a matched comparison program that did not include arts classes. The Bracken Basic Concepts Scale, Third Edition- Receptive (BBCS-3:R) was used to measure children’s school readiness at the start and end of a year of preschool attendance. According to a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), children at the arts-integrated Head Start showed greater gains in school readiness compared to their peers at the comparison program. Univariate tests revealed that attendance at the arts-integrated preschool was associated with greater gains on a general school readiness composite as well as in specific concept areas of texture/material and self/social awareness. Findings suggest that the arts can add value to Head Start preschool. Implications concern the arts as a vehicle for equalizing educational opportunities for young, economically disadvantaged children.The art of Head Start: Intensive arts integration associated with advantage in school readiness for economically disadvantaged children - ScienceDirectThis project was supported in part by an award from the Research: Art Works program at the National Endowment for the Arts: Grant #13-3800-7004.

Original classical and pop-style compositions were produced with digital sound technology to provide orthogonal manipulations of musical tempo, tonality, and texture. Three dimensions (pleasure, arousal, surprise) emerged from the responses measured. Variance analyses found main effects of tempo on both pleasure and arousal, and main effects of tonality on pleasure and surprise. Texture moderated the influence of tempo such that a positive contribution to pleasure was observed for classical music, and a positive contribution to arousal was observed for pop-style music. Texture also moderated the influence of tonality on pleasure, with more pronounced reactions to tonal variations observed among listeners exposed to classical music. Implications for the use of music in consumer research and the interpretation of past music-related findings are discussed.An exploratory investigation of responses elicited by music varying in tempo, tonality, and texture - ScienceDirectRequests for reprints should be sent to James J.

We tested this claim that events optimally discrepant from a schema will be most pleasing. Experts and novices evaluated harmonic progressions at seven levels of syntactic prototypicality. Four results emerged: (1) even novices were extremely sensitive to syntactic atypicality; (2) all subjects found atypical progressions more interesting and complex; (3) novices and undergraduate music students preferred harmonic prototypes, contrary to most aesthetic theories; (4) only music graduate students preferred atypical progressions. We discuss the striking sensitivity of novices to harmonic syntax. We describe differences between an aesthetic theory based on information and uncertainty, and one based on schemas and schema divergence. We also consider the tonal conservatism of most subjects. This conservatism constraints aesthetic theories, and may have implications for music's stylistic evolution.Aesthetic preference and syntactic prototypicality in music: 'Tis the gift to be simple - ScienceDirectWe thank John V. Gilbert and his theory classes for participating; Jon Clune and Jon Platoff for their music theory expertise; and John Platoff for playing enough tonal chord progressions to drive him to a Scriabin concert.Reading comprehension in the presence of unattended speech and music - ScienceDirectThis series of experiments investigated whether the detrimental effects of unattended speech that have been obtained in short-term memory tasks would be obtained in reading comprehension. Such effects would be expected if reading comprehension depends on the maintenance of phonological information in short-term memory. The first three experiments demonstrated that unattended speech but not music interfered with reading comprehension while unattended music had a greater interfering effect than speech on a music identification task. Experiments 4 and 5 showed that the detrimental effect of the speech backgrounds on reading was due to their semantic rather than their phonological properties. The failure to find a phonological interference effect argues against a role for phonological short-term memory in reading comprehension.Reading comprehension in the presence of unattended speech and music - ScienceDirectPreparation of this research article was supported by National Institutes of Health (NINCDS) Grant 19652 to Randi C. Martin and Rice University.Swayed by the music: Sampling bias towards musical preference distinguishes like from dislike decisions - ScienceDirectThis study investigated the interaction between sampling behavior and preference formation underlying subjective decision making for like and dislike decisions. Two-alternative forced-choice tasks were used with closely-matched musical excerpts and the participants were free to listen and re-listen, i.e. to sample and resample each excerpt, until they reached a decision. We predicted that for decisions involving resampling, a sampling bias would be observed before the moment of conscious decision for the like decision only. The results indeed showed a gradually increasing sampling bias favouring the choice (73%) before the moment of overt response for like decisions. Such a bias was absent for dislike decisions. Furthermore, the participants reported stronger relative preferences for like decisions as compared to dislike decisions. This study demonstrated distinct differences in preference formation between like and dislike decisions, both in the implicit orienting/sampling processes prior to the conscious decision and in the subjective evaluation afterwards.Negative self-focused cognitions mediate the effect of trait social anxiety on state anxiety - ScienceDirectThe cognitive model of social anxiety predicts that negative self-focused cognitions increase anxiety when anticipating social threat. To test this prediction, 36 individuals were asked to anticipate and perform a public-speaking task. During anticipation, negative self-focused cognitions or relaxation were experimentally induced while self-reported anxiety, autonomic arousal (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance level), and acoustic eye-blink startle response were assessed. As predicted, negative self-focused cognitions mediated the effects of trait social anxiety on self-reported anxiety and heart rate variability during negative anticipation. Furthermore, trait social anxiety predicted increased startle amplitudes. These findings support a central assumption of the cognitive model of social anxiety.‘Music-therapeutic caregiving’: The necessity of active music-making in clinical care - ScienceDirectSteven Brown is a researcher, Eva Götell a doctoral student, and Sirkka-Liisa Ekman a professor in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Occupational Therapy & Elderly Care Research, Center for Elderly Care Research, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Eva Götell and Sirkka-Liisa Ekman are also in the Department of Science and Health, University of Karlskrona/Ronneby, Karlskrona, Sweden.Skill acquisition in music performance: relations between planning and temporal control - ScienceDirectWe investigated the acquisition of music performance skills in novice and expert pianists. Temporal disruptions in novice performances coincided with constraints in planning capacities. Child and adult pianists ranging in age (9–26 years), training (3–15 years) and sight-reading ability learned to perform a novel musical piece in eleven practice trials. Computer-detected pitch and timing errors revealed: (1) gradual improvements in performance tempo and pitch accuracy with skill level and practice, generally fitting a power function; (2) a relative-timing/pitch accuracy trade-off and high incidence of simultaneous pitch/time errors; (3) improvements in relative timing (temporal continuity, underlying beat, metrical structure) with skill and practice; and (4) increased anticipatory behavior and a greater range of planning with skill and practice. A strong positive relationship between the mastery of temporal constraints and planning abilities within performance suggests that these two cognitive indicators are closely related and may arise from segmentation processes during performance. Examination of sequence timing may explicate planning abilities that underlie many complex skills.Music and Speech Processing in the First Year of Life - ScienceDirectThis chapter focuses on potential similarities between speech and music from the perspective of infant listeners. The stimuli of concern are sound sequences rather than single sounds, despite the predominant research focusing on the latter class of stimuli. The exclusion of single sounds can be justified on a number of grounds. First, several comprehensive reviews of infants' ability to perceive single speech and non-speech sounds are available. Second, evidence indicates that global patterns of speech are more salient in the pre-linguistic period than are individual speech segments. In the non-speech domain, evidence also indicates that infants proceed from global processing of auditory patterns to local processing of pattern details. In drawing parallels between speech and music, the chapter focuses on two principal issues: the input provided by caregivers for their infants and the processing of such input by infant listeners. Much of the work to be reported, particularly in the musical domain, is relatively recent. As a result, the exposition is tentative rather than definitive, its purpose being to suggest new avenues for future research and thinking.Amusia and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: Is there a relationship? - ScienceDirectThe current study explored the music perception ability of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and its relationship with other cognitive abilities and psychotic symptom severity. The persons with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than the control group on the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) (p < 0.001). The music perception ability of persons with schizophrenia was related to other cognitive abilities (attention, verbal memory, spatial memory, and executive function) and the severity of psychotic symptoms.Amusia and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: Is there a relationship? - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work and should be considered co-first authors.An iconic approach to communicating musical concepts in interstellar messages - ScienceDirectSome characteristics of terrestrial music may be meaningful to extraterrestrial civilizations by virtue of the connection between acoustics and mathematics—both of which might be known by technologically advanced extraterrestrial intelligence. For example, a fundamental characteristic of terrestrial polyphonic music is found the number of tones used various scales, insofar as the number of tones represents a compromise between competing musical demands; the number of tones in a scale, however, also reflects some of the perceptual characteristics of the species developing that music. Thus, in the process of communicating something about the structure of terrestrial music through interstellar messages, additional information about human perceptual and cognitive processes can also be conveyed. This paper also discusses methods for sending signals that bear information through the form of the very frequencies in which the signals are transmitted. If the challenges of creating intelligible messages are greater than often thought, the advantage of reduced conventionality of encoding the message by using an iconic format of this sort may be of significant value. Such an approach would allow the incremental introduction of musical concepts, somewhat akin to the step-by-step tutorials in mathematics and logic that form the basis of Freudenthal's Lincos.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirect27 articles were included in the review; the meta-analysis was conducted with 15 articles.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCognitive interventions are safe and effective for demented nursing home residents.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectSignificant benefits were found for various cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCognitive interventions should be provided to nursing home residents with dementia.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectPrevious reviews and meta-analyses demonstrated effects of cognitive interventions in dementia, but none specifically considered residents with dementia in long-term care (LTC) facilities.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectTo analyse the efficacy of cognitive interventions in institutionalised individuals with dementia.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectAfter identifying 27 articles, a systematic review was performed. A meta-analysis was calculated for 15 studies of the randomized controlled trials regarding effects on relevant outcomes. Fixed-effects meta-analyses were conducted using standardized mean differences (SMD) of changes from baseline pooled using the inverse variance method.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectWhen comparing cognitive interventions to passive control groups, the meta-analysis revealed significant moderate effects on global cognition (SMD = 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.67), autobiographical memory (0.67, 0.02–1.31), and behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD; 0.71, 0.06–1.36). Significant small effects were detected for quality of life (QoL; 0.37, 0.05–0.70). Moderate effects on activities of daily living (0.28; −0.02 to 0.58) failed to reach significance; no effects were found on depression (0.22; −0.08 to 0.51). Significant moderate effects of global cognition (0.55; 0.22–0.89) and depression (0.64; 0.21–1.07) were also found for cognitive interventions contrasting active control groups. No harmful events related to the participation in the interventions were observed.Cognitive interventions in patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities: Systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCognitive interventions are safe and effective for residents with dementia in LTC. However, while it seems clear that cognitive benefits can specifially be assigned to these forms of intervention, further research is necessary to clarify whether the effects on BPSD and QoL reflect unspecific changes due to additional attention. Furthermore, future studies will have to determine which intervention type yields the largest benefits.Creativity, primary process cognition and personality - ScienceDirectPotential creativity as measured by the Alternate Uses Test, remoteness of word associations, and rated creativity of fantasy stories was found to be related to primary process content in written fantasy stories. Psychoticism and openness to experience have been found to be related to creativity. There are theoretical reasons to think that they might also be related to use of primary process cognition. However, neither potential creativity nor primary process content were significantly correlated with either psychoticism or openness to experience. An exploratory factor analysis, though, suggests that creativity, primary process cognition, extraversion, and psychoticism are interrelated. The common train linking them together may be disinhibition.Emotional Responses to Musical Intervals with Specific Acoustical Properties and the Effect of the Induced Emotions in Duration Perception - ScienceDirectRecent investigations on the emotional responses to music focus on the use of whole (or excerpts) music pieces (usually well- known) using physiological and/or subjective measurements of arousal and valence (e.g., Iwanaga & Moroki, 1999; Krumhansl, 1997; Rickard, 2004). Usually the musical stimuli are chosen intuitively from the experimenters so as to evoke specific basic emotions (e.g., happiness, fear). It is well established that factors like familiarity and musical preference of the participants affect emotional responses to the stimuli presented (Grewe et al., 2007). Additionally, the musical stimuli used previously contain a plethora of imponderable characteristics that are usually not taken in consideration. These factors may hamper the detection of the specific acoustic properties that can be categorized in terms of the emotion they induce. Our aim, therefore, is to create a set of musical stimuli with defined acoustical properties in order to test whether the variation in one or more of these properties affect participant measures of arousal and valence (both physiologically and subjectively). We expect to replicate findings from previous studies on the following: a) musical pieces in a major mode with fast tempo will be perceived as happy and slow pieces in a minor mode will be perceived as sad (Khalfa et al., 2002), b) 250 ms of musical stimulation will be sufficient for the distinction between happy and sad music (Peretz et al., 1998), and c) consonance represents a measure of pleasantness (Koelsch et al., 2006; Sammler et al., 2007). Additionally, we will extend current knowledge by defining the modulation of specific parameters and the associated emotion induced. The creation and validation of the musical stimuli in our study will be done through a series of psychological and physiological experiments. Subsequently, we aim to test whether the emotions induced through the specific stimuli created will affect the perception of duration. This will allow for the comparison of these findings with those from previous timing studies that have used music and support the notion that arousal and/or valence alter the pulse rate of the internal clock (Droit-Volet et al., 2010).Emotional Responses to Musical Intervals with Specific Acoustical Properties and the Effect of the Induced Emotions in Duration Perception - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Studying emotion through nonlinear processing of EEG - ScienceDirectIn this article we study the effects of emotion on brain activity through nonlinear processing of EEG. EEG was recorded from 19 sites (10-20systems) in different states of brain activity; induced by emotionally valance music stimulus and also during no-task resting states. Then, we compared the EEG complexity of the rest condition with each emotional states. After that we determined the locations in which correlation dimension was changed in different states through one-way ANOVA test. In this study four excerpts of music from both Iranian traditional music and Western classical music, two negative valance and two positive valance pieces, were selected according to the results of Psychological papers.ICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has many causes, including ICU-induced trauma.ICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectLasting ICU-induced PTSD affects a significant portion of ICU patients.ICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectMusic Therapy (MT) is a beneficial and underutilized treatment for ICU-induced PTSD.ICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectCollaborative Songwriting Therapy is potentially more effective than other MT forms.ICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectMore research needs to be conducted to confirm Songwriting as a PTSD treatment.ICU-related PTSD – A review of PTSD and the potential effects of collaborative songwriting therapy - ScienceDirectConflict of interest and financial disclosure: The authors of this manuscript do not have a financial relationship with any aspects of the interventions for PTSD that are presented.

The distinction between episodic and semantic autobiographical memory is particularly informative in this regard. Psychological interventions, particularly those involving reminiscence or music, have led to differential effects on episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. We propose that executive function is a key mediator of psychological therapies on autobiographical memory. We also highlight that interventions that alleviate stress and improve mood, including in major depression, can enhance autobiographical memory. Future research employing more longitudinal approaches and examining moderating factors such as gender and education level will deepen our understanding of changes in AM in later life, enhance our theoretical understanding of the neuroscience of AM and ageing, and help to develop better targeted interventions for preserving AM in older adults.Autobiographical memory, the ageing brain and mechanisms of psychological interventions - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (109KB)Download full-size imagePerformance anxiety, social phobia, and setting effects in instrumental music students - ScienceDirectPerformance anxiety has long been recognized as a problem for musicians. This study aims to assess the role of situational factors involved in music performance anxiety. Performance anxiety of 32 music students was assessed by measuring self-reported anxiety in different performance settings, as well as the students' level of experience, their degree of trait-anxiety, and their degree of social phobia. Performance setting was found to be a critical factor in performance in general and on the influence of social phobia in particular. These results have implications for future research, treatment methods, and the understanding of the relationship between performance anxiety and social phobia.Senses make sense: An individualized multisensory stimulation for dementia - ScienceDirectNonpharmacologic interventions have been recommended as first-line treatments for dementia, and multisensory stimulation environment has been used as a non-pharmacological treatment to dementia patients in the last decade. However, the clinical effect of multisensory stimulation environment remains temporary and uncertain. Individualized medicine has been suggested to hold great promise in medicine, and it should be equally important for dementia. Reminiscence integrating individual experiences into therapeutic schemes has shown potential in the field of improving cognitive functions and depressive symptoms for dementia patients, and interactive music also demonstrated a positive outcome by using individualized music for the hearing aspect. We therefore hypothesize that an individualized multisensory stimulation in a natural and realistic environment integrating personal experience may be an effective intervention for patients suffering from dementia.Bridging cognition, the brain and molecular genetics: evidence from Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WMS) is a rare sporadic disorder that yields a distinctive profile of medical, cognitive, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic characteristics. The cognitive hallmark of WMS is a dissociation between language and face processing (relative strengths) and spatial cognition (profound impairment). Individuals with WMS also tend to be overly social, behavior that is opposite to that seen in autism. A genetic hallmark of WMS is a deletion on chromosome band 7q11.23. Williams syndrome is also associated with specific neuromorphological and neurophysiological profiles: proportional sparing of frontal, limbic and neocerebellar structures is seen using MRI; and abnormal functional organization of the neural systems that underlie both language and face processing is revealed through studies using event-related potentials. The non-uniformity in the cognitive, neuromorphological and neurophysiological domains of WMS make it a compelling model for elucidating the relationships between cognition, the brain and, ultimately, the genes.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectThe importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectResonance frequencies of neural oscillators represent an individual trait.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectSpeech processing can be linked to individual resonance frequencies.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectEarly auditory memory processes are elemental for speech processing.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectAdjustment of the presentation rate might enhance suboptimal auditory processing.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectEnhanced auditory processing might increase individuals speech intelligibility.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectOscillatory EEG activity in the human brain with frequencies in the gamma range (approx. 30–80 Hz) is known to be relevant for a large number of cognitive processes. Interestingly, each subject reveals an individual frequency of the auditory gamma-band response (GBR) that coincides with the peak in the auditory steady state response (ASSR). A common resonance frequency of auditory cortex seems to underlie both the individual frequency of the GBR and the peak of the ASSR. This review sheds light on the functional role of oscillatory gamma activity for auditory processing. For successful processing, the auditory system has to track changes in auditory input over time and store information about past events in memory which allows the construction of auditory objects. Recent findings support the idea of gamma oscillations being involved in the partitioning of auditory input into discrete samples to facilitate higher order processing. We review experiments that seem to suggest that inter-individual differences in the resonance frequency are behaviorally relevant for gap detection and speech processing. A possible application of these resonance frequencies for brain computer interfaces is illustrated with regard to optimized individual presentation rates for auditory input to correspond with endogenous oscillatory activity.The importance of individual frequencies of endogenous brain oscillations for auditory cognition – A short review - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Auditory working memory.Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectTo describe the recruitment and baseline results of the Community of Voices study that aims to examine the effect of a community choir intervention on the health and well-being of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectUsing community-based participatory research methods, we recruited adults age 60 and over from 12 Administration on Aging–supported senior centers in San Francisco into a 2-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial of the community choir intervention. Multiple outreach methods were used. We tracked outreach, screening, and recruitment metrics and collected demographics and baseline outcomes via community-based, interviewer-administered surveys and performance measures of cognition, physical function, and psychosocial variables.Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectThe study contacted 819 individuals, screened 636, and enrolled 390 diverse older adults over a 42-month, phased recruitment period. The mean age was 71.2 (SD = 7.3), and the majority were women. Two-thirds of the sample are non-white, and 20% of participants reported having financial hardship.Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectOutreach and recruitment methods used in the Community of Voices trial facilitated enrollment of a large proportion of minority and lower-SES older adults in the final sample.

We suggest that a generative Bayesian approach towards perception provides a powerful theoretical framework to accommodate how such high-level social factors can influence low-level perceptual processes in their earliest stages. We review experimental findings that show how social factors shape the perception and evaluation of people, behaviour, and socially relevant objects or information. Subsequently, we summarize the generative view of perception within the ‘Bayesian brain’, and show how such a framework can account for the pervasive effects of top-down social knowledge on social cognition. Finally, we sketch the theoretical and experimental implications of social predictive perception, indicating new directions for research on the effects and neurocognitive underpinnings of social cognition.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectFrom everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectA multi-mechanism framework for emotional responses to music is presented.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectThe framework can explain both ‘everyday emotions’ and ‘aesthetic emotions’.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectEmotions may occur in parallel with aesthetic judgments or as a result of them.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectAesthetic judgments are assumed to involve individual sets of weighted criteria.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectThe framework can reconcile previously distinct approaches to musical emotions.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectThe sound of music may arouse profound emotions in listeners. But such experiences seem to involve a ‘paradox’, namely that music – an abstract form of art, which appears removed from our concerns in everyday life – can arouse emotions – biologically evolved reactions related to human survival. How are these (seemingly) non-commensurable phenomena linked together? Key is to understand the processes through which sounds are imbued with meaning. It can be argued that the survival of our ancient ancestors depended on their ability to detect patterns in sounds, derive meaning from them, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Such an ecological perspective on sound and emotion forms the basis of a recent multi-level framework that aims to explain emotional responses to music in terms of a large set of psychological mechanisms. The goal of this review is to offer an updated and expanded version of the framework that can explain both ‘everyday emotions’ and ‘aesthetic emotions’. The revised framework – referred to as BRECVEMA – includes eight mechanisms: Brain Stem Reflex, Rhythmic Entrainment, Evaluative Conditioning, Contagion, Visual Imagery, Episodic Memory, Musical Expectancy, and Aesthetic Judgment. In this review, it is argued that all of the above mechanisms may be directed at information that occurs in a ‘musical event’ (i.e., a specific constellation of music, listener, and context). Of particular significance is the addition of a mechanism corresponding to aesthetic judgments of the music, to better account for typical ‘appreciation emotions’ such as admiration and awe. Relationships between aesthetic judgments and other mechanisms are reviewed based on the revised framework. It is suggested that the framework may contribute to a long-needed reconciliation between previous approaches that have conceptualized music listenersʼ responses in terms of either ‘everyday emotions’ or ‘aesthetic emotions’.High-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research - ScienceDirectHuman intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are primarily performed in epileptic patients for presurgical mapping. When patients perform cognitive tasks, iEEG signals reveal high-frequency neural activities (HFAs, between around 40 Hz and 150 Hz) with exquisite anatomical, functional and temporal specificity. Such HFAs were originally interpreted in the context of perceptual or motor binding, in line with animal studies on gamma-band (‘40 Hz’) neural synchronization. Today, our understanding of HFA has evolved into a more general index of cortical processing: task-induced HFA reveals, with excellent spatial and time resolution, the participation of local neural ensembles in the task-at-hand, and perhaps the neural communication mechanisms allowing them to do so. This review promotes the claim that studying HFA with iEEG provides insights into the neural bases of cognition that cannot be derived as easily from other approaches, such as fMRI. We provide a series of examples supporting that claim, drawn from studies on memory, language and default-mode networks, and successful attempts of real-time functional mapping. These examples are followed by several guidelines for HFA research, intended for new groups interested by this approach. Overall, iEEG research on HFA should play an increasing role in cognitive neuroscience in humans, because it can be explicitly linked to basic research in animals. We conclude by discussing the future evolution of this field, which might expand that role even further, for instance through the use of multi-scale electrodes and the fusion of iEEG with MEG and fMRI.High-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research - ScienceDirect► High-frequency activity in intracranial EEG reveals human functional network dynamics. ► Intracranial EEG bridges human functional neuroimaging and animal electrophysiology. ► Intracranial EEG can provide key tests of brain-based models of human cognition. ► Guidelines proposed for the analysis of intracranial EEG data during cognitive tasks.Effect of musical experience on verbal memory in Williams syndrome: Evidence from a novel word learning task - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is a neurogenetic developmental disorder characterized by an increased affinity for music, deficits in verbal memory, and atypical brain development. Music has been shown to improve verbal memory in typical individuals as well as those with learning difficulties, but no studies have examined this relationship in WS. The aim of our two studies was to examine whether music can enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS. In Study 1, we presented a memory task of eight spoken or sung sentences that described an animal and identified its group name to 38 individuals with WS. Study 2, involving another group of individuals with WS (n = 38), included six spoken or sung sentences that identified an animal group name. In both studies, those who had participated in formal music lessons scored significantly better on the verbal memory task when the sentences were sung than when they were spoken. Those who had not taken formal lessons showed no such benefit. We also found that increased enjoyment of music and heightened emotional reactions to music did not impact performance on the memory task. These compelling findings provide the first evidence that musical experience may enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS and shed more light on the complex relationship between aspects of cognition and altered neurodevelopment in this unique disorder.Effect of musical experience on verbal memory in Williams syndrome: Evidence from a novel word learning task - ScienceDirect► We examine whether music can enhance verbal memory in Williams syndrome. ► Only those who had taken formal music lessons showed improved memory using sung stimuli. ► Increased music enjoyment was not associated with improved memory in the sung condition. ► Findings may lead to interventions for improved academic and functional outcomes in WS.The tonal function of a task-irrelevant chord modulates speed of visual processing - ScienceDirectHarmonic priming studies have provided evidence that musical expectations influence sung phoneme monitoring, with facilitated processing for phonemes sung on tonally related (expected) chords in comparison to less-related (less-expected) chords [Bigand, Tillmann, Poulin, D’Adamo, and Madurell (2001). The effect of harmonic context on phoneme monitoring in vocal music. Cognition, 81, B11–B20]. This tonal relatedness effect has suggested two interpretations: (a) processing of music and language interact at some level of processing; and (b) tonal functions of chords influence task performance via listeners’ attention. Our study investigated these hypotheses by exploring whether the effect of tonal relatedness extends to the processing of visually presented syllables (Experiments 1 and 2) and geometric forms (Experiments 3 and 4). For Experiments 1–4, visual target identification was faster when the musical background fulfilled listeners’ expectations (i.e., a related chord was played simultaneously). In Experiment 4, the addition of a baseline condition (i.e., without an established tonal center) further showed that the observed difference was due to a facilitation linked to the related chord and not to an inhibition or disruption caused by the less-related chord. This outcome suggests the influence of musical structures on attentional mechanisms and that these mechanisms are shared between auditory and visual modalities. The implications for research investigating neural correlates shared by music and language processing are discussed.Emotions drive attention: Effects on driver’s behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic is the favourite activity while driving. However, very few studies have investigated its impact on driving performances. This study was designed to assess the effect of music’s emotional valence on driving behaviour. Happy, sad and neutral music excerpts were alternated with no-music phases while driving in a simulator. Results showed that happy music distracted drivers the most as their mean speed unexpectedly decreased and their lateral control deteriorated. Sad music influenced drivers in a different way as they drove slowly and kept their vehicle in its lane. These findings were discussed within the framework of attentional orienting and emotions.Intergroup Perception and Cognition: An Integrative Framework for Understanding the Causes and Consequences of Social Categorization - ScienceDirectThe primary aim of this chapter is to provide a framework to understand and synthesize the processes of person construal—early perceptions that lead to initial ingroup/outgroup categorizations—with the processes involved in intergroup relations. To this end, we review research examining the initial perception and categorization of ingroup and outgroup members and its downstream consequences. We first discuss bottom-up processes in person construal based on visual features (e.g., facial prototypicality and bodily cues), and then discuss how top-down factors (e.g., beliefs, stereotypes) may influence these processes. Next, we examine how the initial categorization of targets as ingroup or outgroup members influences identification, stereotyping, and group-based evaluations, and the relations between these constructs. We also explore the implications of the activation of these constructs for a range of social judgments including emotion identification, empathy, and intergroup behaviors. Finally, we describe a variety of well established and more recent strategies to reduce intergroup bias that target the activation of category-based knowledge, including intergroup contact, approach orientations, evaluative conditioning, and perspective taking.The effect of auditory versus visual violent media exposure on aggressive behaviour: The role of song lyrics, video clips and musical tone - ScienceDirectFive decades of research have shown clear links between exposure to violent visual media and subsequent aggression, however there has been little research that directly compares the effects of exposure to violent visual versus auditory media, or which has experimentally tested the effect of violent song lyrics with musical ‘tone’ held constant. In the current study 194 participants heard music either with or without lyrics, and with or without a violent music video, and were then given the chance to aggress using the hot sauce paradigm. Musical tone was held constant across groups, and a fifth (control) group had no media exposure at all. Experimental groups, on average, were significantly more aggressive than controls. The strongest effect was elicited by exposure to violent lyrics, regardless of whether violent imagery accompanied the music, and regardless of various person-based characteristics. Implications for theories of media violence and models of aggression are discussed.The effect of auditory versus visual violent media exposure on aggressive behaviour: The role of song lyrics, video clips and musical tone - ScienceDirect► A violent music-aggression link was found. ► Violent lyrics had a robust effect on aggression holding musical ‘tone’ constant. ► The results were similar across three violent music video clips from three music genres. ► The effect was undiminished holding trait aggression and personality variables constant.Saw Palmetto, Chinese Red Yeast Extract, Music Therapy, Ginkgo Biloba, Increased Practitioner Interaction - ScienceDirectRichard Glickman-Simon, MD, is a family physician, integrative medicine editor of DynaMed, and assistant professor of public health and family medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Saw Palmetto, Chinese Red Yeast Extract, Music Therapy, Ginkgo Biloba, Increased Practitioner Interaction - ScienceDirectKelley Withy, MD, PhD, is a Professor of Complementary/Alternative Medicine; Executive Director John A.

The neurology of kinetic art. Brain 117, 607–636], then investigation of response to artistic performance holds promise as a window to perceptual and cognitive processes. A new instrument for recording real-time audience response – the portable Audience Response Facility (pARF) – is described. Twenty, hand-held, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) collect responses on customizable skin interfaces. The pARF server transmits the customizable options, synchronizes devices and collects data for export. We report two studies using the pARF that demonstrate respondent agreement of perceived emotion during particular sections of two dance works. Greater agreement was evident in continuous ratings of arousal than valence; arousal appears to be related to surface features of the dance work. Future applications of the pARF to studies of multi-modal perception and cognition are discussed.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectMusical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectWe examined motor system activity while listening to high- and low-groove music.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectNo differences in MEPs occurred between low-groove music and a noise control.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectHigh-groove music modulated MEPs, but in different directions for musicians and non-musicians.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectWith groove music, MEPs were larger on-beat than off-beat, only for the musicians.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectMusical training modulates the effects of high-groove music on the motor system.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectGroove is often described as a musical quality that can induce movement in a listener. This study examines the effects of listening to groove music on corticospinal excitability. Musicians and non-musicians listened to high-groove music, low-groove music, and spectrally matched noise, while receiving single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex either on-beat or off-beat. We examined changes in the amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), recorded from hand and arm muscles, as an index of activity within the motor system. Musicians and non-musicians rated groove similarly. MEP results showed that high-groove music modulated corticospinal excitability, whereas no difference occurred between low-groove music and noise. More specifically, musicians’ MEPs were larger with high-groove than low-groove music, and this effect was especially pronounced for on-beat compared to off-beat pulses. These results indicate that high-groove music increasingly engages the motor system, and the temporal modulation of corticospinal excitability with the beat could stem from tight auditory–motor links in musicians. Conversely, non-musicians’ MEPs were smaller for high-groove than low-groove music, and there was no effect of on- versus off-beat pulses, potentially stemming from suppression of overt movement. In sum, high-groove music engages the motor system, and previous training modulates how listening to music with a strong groove activates the motor system.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectThe cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectWe compare findings of frontoparietal activation across four cognitive functions.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectWe argue that this activation partly reflects internal attention processes.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectTask-specific frontoparietal activations are related to internal representations.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectWe develop a neural model of cognitive functions emerging from internal attention.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectNeuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported findings of activation in frontoparietal regions that largely overlap across various cognitive functions. Part of this frontoparietal activation has been interpreted as reflecting attentional mechanisms that can adaptively be directed towards external stimulation as well as internal representations (internal attention), thereby generating the experience of distinct cognitive functions. Nevertheless, findings of material- and task-specific activation in frontal and parietal regions challenge this internal attention hypothesis and have been used to support more modular hypotheses of cognitive function. The aim of this review is twofold: First, it discusses evidence in support of the concept of internal attention and the so-called dorsal attention network (DAN) as its neural source with respect to three cognitive functions (working memory, episodic retrieval, and mental imagery). While DAN activation in all three functions has been separately linked to internal attention, a comprehensive and integrative review has so far been lacking. Second, the review examines findings of material- and process-specific activation within frontoparietal regions, arguing that these results are well compatible with the internal attention account of frontoparietal activation. A new model of cognition is presented, proposing that supposedly different cognitive concepts actually rely on similar attentional network dynamics to maintain, reactivate and newly create internal representations of stimuli in various modalities. Attentional as well as representational mechanisms are assigned to frontal and parietal regions, positing that some regions are implicated in the allocation of attentional resources to perceptual or internal representations, but others are involved in the representational processes themselves.On the structure of dispositions.

Transposability of and oppositions between aesthetic dispositions - ScienceDirectCultural sociology has reached conclusions about the properties of dispositions based on analyses of aesthetic principles external to the individual. I challenge this approach, and I reflect on two assumptions regarding the structure of dispositions prevalent in cultural sociology that ensue from this approach: (1) Dispositions are transposable across aesthetic domains (e.g., music, literature, visual arts), and (2) there exists one hegemonic configuration of dispositions which can be derived from the structure of the cultural field. I use data from an audience survey in two art museums in Flanders (Belgium) (n = 1448) and analyse aesthetic dispositions towards visual arts and towards music. Applying Relational Class Analysis, I find different dispositional configurations. These configurations are characterised by oppositions between aesthetic principles that do not coincide with the oppositions between aesthetic principles in the cultural field. Moreover, these configurations suggest that dispositions vary to the extent that they are transposable across aesthetic domains.On the structure of dispositions. Transposability of and oppositions between aesthetic dispositions - ScienceDirectStijn Daenekindt received his PhD in Sociology at Ghent University (2015). His interests lie in cultural sociology and in political sociology.Incidental and online learning of melodic structure - ScienceDirectThe cognition of music, like that of language, is partly rooted in enculturative processes of implicit and incidental learning. Musicians and nonmusicians alike are commonly found to possess detailed implicit knowledge of musical structure which is acquired incidentally through interaction with large samples of music. This paper reports an experiment combining the methodology of artificial grammar learning with musical acquisition of melodic structure. Participants acquired knowledge of grammatical melodic structures under incidental learning conditions in both experimental and untrained control conditions. Subsequent analysis indicates a large effect of unsupervised online learning in the experimental and control group throughout the course of the testing phase suggesting an effective ongoing learning process. Musicians did not outperform nonmusicians, indicating that musical expertise is not advantageous for the learning of a new, unfamiliar melodic system. Confidence ratings suggest that participants became aware of the knowledge guiding their classification performance despite the incidental learning conditions.Development of General Competencies within the Context of Teacher Training - ScienceDirectModern educational goals emphasise the development of general competencies needed for any human activities (Key competencies for Lifelong Learning, 2010). Based on the experience of Lithuanian and foreign educationalists, the present article discusses the possibilities of developing general competencies of pre-service teachers of music by applying the project method. The most important strategies of development of general competencies, based on musical activities, in pre-service teachers of music are highlighted and were verified by an educational project. The research is related to the analysis of opportunities of improvement of students’ competencies of reflection and learning to learn, as well as communication and cooperation.Development of General Competencies within the Context of Teacher Training - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of WCES 2014.The contribution of music vs instructions in the Musical Mood Induction Procedure - ScienceDirectThe relative contribution of the instructions and the music to the effects of the Musical Mood Induction Procedure (MMIP) were investigated. Using an experimental procedure which minimised covert experimenter bias, subjects performed under both elation and depression mood inductions in one of four conditions: music present or absent by mood change instructions present or absent, using a crossover design. Results indicated that instructions were both necessary and sufficient to produce change on mood sensitive measures. Mood change effects were reduced by controlling for the effect of subjects who responded so as not to ‘louse-up’ the experiment. The MMIP seems to be much less musical than the name implies. Further research is needed to determine which aspects of the instructions contribute most to the changes on mood sensitive measures.Cross-modal interactions in the perception of musical performance - ScienceDirectWe investigate the dynamics of sensory integration for perceiving musical performance, a complex natural behavior. Thirty musically trained participants saw, heard, or both saw and heard, performances by two clarinetists. All participants used a sliding potentiometer to make continuous judgments of tension (a measure correlated with emotional response) and continuous judgments of phrasing (a measure correlated with perceived musical structure) as performances were presented. The data analysis sought to reveal relations between the sensory modalities (vision and audition) and to quantify the effect of seeing the performances on participants' overall subjective experience of the music. In addition to traditional statistics, functional data analysis techniques were employed to analyze time-varying aspects of the data. The auditory and visual channels were found to convey similar experiences of phrasing but different experiences of tension through much of the performances. We found that visual information served both to augment and to reduce the experience of tension at different points in the musical piece (as revealed by functional linear modeling and functional significance testing). In addition, the musicians' movements served to extend the sense of phrasing, to cue the beginning of new phrases, to indicate musical interpretation, and to anticipate changes in emotional content. Evidence for an interaction effect suggests that there may exist an emergent quality when musical performances are both seen and heard. The investigation augments knowledge of human communicative processes spanning language and music, and involving multiple modalities of emotion and information transfer.Anticipation: Beyond synthetic biology and cognitive robotics - ScienceDirectThe aim of this paper is to propose that current robotic technologies cannot have intentional states any more than is feasible within the sensorimotor variant of embodied cognition. It argues that anticipation is an emerging concept that can provide a bridge between both the deepest philosophical theories about the nature of life and cognition and the empirical biological and cognitive sciences steeped in reductionist and Newtonian conceptions of causality.Anticipation: Beyond synthetic biology and cognitive robotics - ScienceDirectThe paper advocates that in order to move forward, cognitive robotics needs to embrace new platforms and a conceptual framework that will enable it to pursue, in a meaningful way, questions about autonomy and purposeful behaviour. We suggest that hybrid systems, part robotic and part cultures of neurones, offer experimental platforms where different dimensions of enactivism (sensorimotor, constitutive foundations of biological autonomy, including anticipation), and their relative contributions to cognition, can be investigated in an integrated way.Anticipation: Beyond synthetic biology and cognitive robotics - ScienceDirectA careful progression, mindful to the deep philosophical concerns but also respecting empirical evidence, will ultimately lead towards unifying theoretical and empirical biological sciences and may offer advancement where reductionist sciences have been so far faltering.The Phenomenon of Riho Päts as a Developer of Learning Design in Estonia - ScienceDirectThe founder of today's learning design of Estonian music education is Riho Päts (1899-1977), a composer and pedagogue. The aim of this study is to identify Päts's phenomenon in the dynamics of the learning design of music education in 1925-1975. The study seeks whether Päts's learning design principles are reflected in music education nowadays. Relying on the phenomenological approach and using document analysis the development of the learning design is described. The study reveals that Päts's concept is reflected in the music education syllabus of the National Curriculum for basic and upper-secondary schools of Estonia confirmed in 2011.Short-term plasticity in auditory cognition - ScienceDirectConverging lines of evidence suggest that auditory system short-term plasticity can enable several perceptual and cognitive functions that have been previously considered as relatively distinct phenomena. Here we review recent findings suggesting that auditory stimulation, auditory selective attention and cross-modal effects of visual stimulation each cause transient excitatory and (surround) inhibitory modulations in the auditory cortex. These modulations might adaptively tune hierarchically organized sound feature maps of the auditory cortex (e.g. tonotopy), thus filtering relevant sounds during rapidly changing environmental and task demands. This could support auditory sensory memory, pre-attentive detection of sound novelty, enhanced perception during selective attention, influence of visual processing on auditory perception and longer-term plastic changes associated with perceptual learning.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectHuman lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectReview of human lesion studies of vmPFC.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectvmPFC damage associated with dramatic changes in personality and behavior.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectDeficits in affect, decision-making, social conduct/cognition, and memory.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectFunctional impact of vmPFC lesion etiology, laterality, and age onset are discussed.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectvmPFC is critical for diverse aspects of adaptive function.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectStudies of neurological patients with focal lesions involving ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have demonstrated a critical role for this brain area in various aspects of cognition, emotion, and behavior. In this article, we review the key themes, methods, and findings from neuropsychological research on vmPFC lesion patients. Early case studies demonstrated profound disruptions in personality and behavior following vmPFC damage, including blunted affect, poor decision-making, and inappropriate social behavior. Subsequent laboratory investigations with groups of vmPFC lesion patients have revealed deficits in a host of interrelated functions, such as value-based decision-making, future and counterfactual thinking, physiological arousal to emotional stimuli, emotion recognition, empathy, moral judgment, and memory confabulation. The compendium of findings described here demonstrates that vmPFC is crucial for diverse aspects of adaptive function.Musical preferences and learning outcome of medical students in cadaver dissection laboratory: A Nigerian survey - ScienceDirectBackground music has been reported to enhance learning in the cadaver dissection laboratory. This study was designed to determine the impact of various forms of musical genre and some of their characteristics on students’ learning outcome in the dissection laboratory. Some selected musical genre in vocal and non-vocal forms and at different tempi and volume were played as background music (BM) to 253 Medical and Dental students during various sessions of cadaver dissection. Psychological Stress assessment was done using Psychological stress measure-9. Participants love for music, preferred musical genre and other musical characteristics were assessed. The impact of the various musical genre and their characteristics on learning was done via written examination on the region dissected during each musical session. A positive relationship was noted between students’ preference for musical genre during leisure with their preference for BM during private study time (P < 0.01). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) were established in the impacts of the selected musical genre on some selected learning factors. Country and Classical music gave the highest positive impact on the various learning factors in CDL followed by R&B. No significant difference was noted between the cognitive values of vocal and non-vocal music. Classical music most effectively reduced the stress induced by dissection in the CDL while Reggae and High life musical genre created a more stressful environment than regular background noise (P < 0.01). Moderate volume level and Tempo were most preferred during both cadaver dissection activity and leisure hours. This study shows statistically significant differences in the cognitive values of some of the studied musical genre and their various characteristics. The inability to isolate the particular musical genre with these desired properties could account for the controversies in the reports of the role of music in academic environment.The influence of music on social cognitive skills - ScienceDirectLilja Ulfarsdottir is a nurse therapist and a PhD student at University College Northampton.The influence of music on social cognitive skills - ScienceDirectPhilip Erwin is Reader in Psychology at UCN, and a Chartered Counselling Psychologist.Meta-analytic evidence for the non-modularity of pitch processing in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectA major theme driving research in congenital amusia is related to the modularity of this musical disorder, with two possible sources of the amusic pitch perception deficit. The first possibility is that the amusic deficit is due to a broad disorder of acoustic pitch processing that has the effect of disrupting downstream musical pitch processing, and the second is that amusia is specific to a musical pitch processing module. To interrogate these hypotheses, we performed a meta-analysis on two types of effect sizes contained within 42 studies in the amusia literature: the performance gap between amusics and controls on tasks of pitch discrimination, broadly defined, and the correlation between specifically acoustic pitch perception and musical pitch perception. To augment the correlation database, we also calculated this correlation using data from 106 participants tested by our own research group. We found strong evidence for the acoustic account of amusia. The magnitude of the performance gap was moderated by the size of pitch change, but not by whether the stimuli were composed of tones or speech. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between an individual's acoustic and musical pitch perception. However, individual cases show a double dissociation between acoustic and musical processing, which suggests that although most amusic cases are probably explainable by an acoustic deficit, there is heterogeneity within the disorder. Finally, we found that tonal language fluency does not influence the performance gap between amusics and controls, and that there was no evidence that amusics fare worse with pitch direction tasks than pitch discrimination tasks. These results constitute a quantitative review of the current literature of congenital amusia, and suggest several new directions for research, including the experimental induction of amusic behaviour through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the systematic exploration of the developmental trajectory of this disorder.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectThe effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectScore reading involves attending and interpreting multiple visual constituents.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectBeams are typically considered a graphic representation of metric chunking.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectThe investigation proposed that beams could enhance visual perception of contour.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectIn two studies participants judged the direction of notes, beams, and pitches; dimensions were congruent or incongruent.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectFindings confirmed that notes and beams are processed automatically during reading, and beams serve as informants of contour.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectMusical score reading is a complex task, which involves attending and interpreting multiple visual constituents that are graphically congested. The present investigation examined the ‘beam’, which although consistently found in music notation, is typically considered as providing no more information than marking metric boundaries (i.e., chunking). However, we provide evidence here that beams enhance visual perception of contour. In Study 1, a Stroop-like paradigm was used in which participants were required to judge the direction of notes or the beam in a compound figure; the two dimensions were either congruent or incongruent. A congruency effect was observed in both tasks, confirming that both notes and beam are processed automatically during score reading. In Study 2, an additional auditory stimulus was presented. The results not only replicated the findings of Study 1, but showed that beams affect both visual and auditory perception. Finally, group differences surfaced: musicians were more affected by the direction of notes than non-musicians when attending to beams, but the effect of beams on judging note direction was comparable in both groups. The implications for understanding musical score reading – specifically issues related to melodic contour – are discussed.Cerebral Lateralization of Familiar and Unfamiliar Music Perception in Nonmusicians: A Dual Task Approach - ScienceDirectIn a dual task procedure that controls for attentional trade-off effects, asymmetrical in terference effects were observed in dual task conditions of finger tapping and concurren processing of familiar and unfamiliar music. Laterality effects suggested that perception of orchestral presentations is largely lateralized to the left hemisphere in both males and females. In a second dual task condition of vocalization and music processing, both males and females displayed interference in speech production during concurrent music processing. Males showed greater left hemispheric interference effects during simultaneous vocalization and music processing.Cerebral Lateralization of Familiar and Unfamiliar Music Perception in Nonmusicians: A Dual Task Approach - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cerebral Lateralization of Familiar and Unfamiliar Music Perception in Nonmusicians: A Dual Task Approach - ScienceDirectDr. Richard C.

It can provide useful projective, diagnostic data and help to determine the suitability of music therapy as a treatment modality. Although this assessment was designed for young adolescents in particular, it has also been varied to suit other populations. The validity of this procedure would be determined by the systematic implementation of all tasks. This writter suggests changes in song lists or listening lists to realistically accommodate different age groups. It would necessitate careful documentation of musical/behavioral criteria indicators, as well as areas of assessment. When assessing a more disturbed or psychotic patient, the music therapist may choose to vary the order of tasks or do the assessment over a longer period of time.An individual music therapy assessment procedure for emotionally disturbed young adolescents - ScienceDirectNancy Wells, Music Therapy Supervisor within the Expressive Therapy Department at Portsmouth Psychiatric Center, Portsmouth, VA, is also President of the Virginia Association for Music Therapy.

Later, Krause et al. reported of distinct ERD/ERS responses during an auditory memory task: the encoding of acoustic material elicited alpha-frequency ERS whereas retrieval or recognition of the same stimulus material evoked alpha ERD. The research group of Krause and co-workers has published several reports on acoustically evoked ERD/ERS responses utilizing various cognitive tasks and diverse stimuli. Recently, also clinical studies have been initiated. This chapter reviews, summarizes, and discusses the findings on cognition- and memory-related ERD/ERS responses specifically in the auditory stimulus modality.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectEncoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectMRI encoding is used to investigate the cortical representation of sound timbre.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectWe compare a subjective timbre model to spectral/spectrotemporal modulation models.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectThe timbre model outperforms spectral, but not spectrotemporal modulation models.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectThe timbre model outperforms all other models in parts of early auditory cortex.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectResults support a distributed encoding of timbre dimensions in auditory cortex.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectTimbre, or sound quality, is a crucial but poorly understood dimension of auditory perception that is important in describing speech, music, and environmental sounds. The present study investigates the cortical representation of different timbral dimensions. Encoding models have typically incorporated the physical characteristics of sounds as features when attempting to understand their neural representation with functional MRI. Here we test an encoding model that is based on five subjectively derived dimensions of timbre to predict cortical responses to natural orchestral sounds. Results show that this timbre model can outperform other models based on spectral characteristics, and can perform as well as a complex joint spectrotemporal modulation model. In cortical regions at the medial border of Heschl's gyrus, bilaterally, and regions at its posterior adjacency in the right hemisphere, the timbre model outperforms even the complex joint spectrotemporal modulation model. These findings suggest that the responses of cortical neuronal populations in auditory cortex may reflect the encoding of perceptual timbre dimensions.Neurological basis of language and sequential cognition: Evidence from simulation, aphasia, and ERP studies - ScienceDirectThe current research addresses the hypothesis that certain aspects of sequential cognition have made substantial contributions to the human language processing capability, from a functional neurophysiology perspective. We first describe a cognitive sequence processing model that was developed based on the functional neuroanatomy of primate cortex and basal ganglia. We demonstrate how this model is capable of simulating the behavior of human infants in extracting serial, temporal and abstract structure from language-like sound sequences as revealed in recent psycholinguistic experiments. We then demonstrate how, through training, this model can perform adult level syntactic comprehension, based on dissociated processing streams for open vs. closed class words. The model subsequently predicts: (1) that impaired syntactic processing (as in agrammatic aphasia) will be associated with impairments in corresponding non-linguistic cognitive sequencing tasks, and (2) that neurophysiological processes (as revealed by ERPs) involved in syntactic processing should also be involved in the corresponding non-linguistic cognitive sequencing tasks. Data confirming these predictions are reviewed. We conclude that the study of sequential cognition will provide a new paradigm for the investigation of the neurophysiological bases of language.Enoxaparin treatment administered at both early and late stages of amyloid β deposition improves cognition of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with differential effects on brain Aβ levels - ScienceDirectEnoxaparin (Enox), a low molecular weight heparin, has been shown to lower brain amyloid β (Aβ) load in a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect of Enox on cognition was not studied. Therefore, we examined the effect of peripheral Enox treatment on cognition and brain Aβ levels in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model by giving injections at an early (starting at 5 months of age) and late (starting at 10 and 12 months of age) stage of Aβ accumulation for 3 months. Although Enox had no effect on behaviour in the open field at any age, it improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze in 5-, 10- and 12-month-old mice. Furthermore, Enox treatment seemed to decrease guanidine HCl-extracted brain Aβ levels at 5 months of age, but significantly increased guanidine HCl-extracted Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels in both 10- and 12-month-old mice. In vitro, Enox increased aggregation of Aβ, even when Aβ was pre-aggregated.Enoxaparin treatment administered at both early and late stages of amyloid β deposition improves cognition of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with differential effects on brain Aβ levels - ScienceDirectIn conclusion, Enox treatment, either at an early or a late stage of Aβ accumulation, could improve cognition in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. However, since Enox treatment at an early stage of Aβ accumulation decreased guanidine HCl-extracted Aβ levels and Enox treatment at a late stage enhanced guanidine HCl-extracted Aβ levels, it seems that Enox influences Aβ deposition differently at different stages of Aβ pathology. In any case, our study suggests that enoxaparin treatment has potential as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.Impaired non-verbal emotion processing in Pathological Gamblers - ScienceDirectImpaired non-verbal emotion processing in Pathological Gamblers - ScienceDirectSocial perception is impaired in addictions with substances.Impaired non-verbal emotion processing in Pathological Gamblers - ScienceDirectPathological Gamblers display impaired decoding of emotions in faces, voices and music.Impaired non-verbal emotion processing in Pathological Gamblers - ScienceDirectSocial perception deficits are not solely due to a toxic effect on the brain.Impaired non-verbal emotion processing in Pathological Gamblers - ScienceDirectImpaired perception of emotion in others has been described and confirmed in addictions with substances, but no such data exists regarding addictions without substances. As it has been hypothesized that toxic effect of substances on the brain was responsible for the impairments described, studying addictions without substances could be of interest to confirm this hypothesis. Twenty-two male pathological gamblers were compared to 22 male healthy controls matched for age and education level on non-verbal emotion perception tasks including faces, voices, and musical excerpts. Depression and anxiety levels were controlled for. Pathological gamblers significantly underestimated the intensity of peacefulness in music, and overall they were less accurate when reading emotion in voices and faces. They also overestimated emotional intensity in neutral voices and faces. Although anxiety levels did account for accuracy problems when detecting fear in voices and for overestimating emotions in neutral faces, anxiety levels did not explain the range of deficits observed. This is the first study showing non-verbal perception deficits in a purely behavioural addiction. These findings show that deficits in decoding non-verbal signals are associated with addictive behaviours per se, and are not due solely to toxic effects of substances on the brain.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN provides an objective assessment of CI functioning in children, adolescents and adults.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectIn infants with CI, the MMN provides the only means for assessing CI improvement.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN may be used as a tool in developing and testing novel rehabilitation procedures.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN may objectively assess the discrimination of different features of music in CI users.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectMulti-feature MMN paradigms permit assessment of discrimination of several auditory dimensions.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectIn the present article, we review the studies on the use of the mismatch negativity (MMN) as a tool for an objective assessment of cochlear-implant (CI) functioning after its implantation and as a function of time of CI use. The MMN indexes discrimination of different sound stimuli with a precision matching with that of behavioral discrimination and can therefore be used as its objective index. Importantly, these measurements can be reliably carried out even in the absence of attention and behavioral responses and therefore they can be extended to populations that are not capable of behaviorally reporting their perception such as infants and different clinical patient groups. In infants and small children with CI, the MMN provides the only means for assessing the adequacy of the CI functioning, its improvement as a function of time of CI use, and the efficiency of different rehabilitation procedures. Therefore, the MMN can also be used as a tool in developing and testing different novel rehabilitation procedures. Importantly, the recently developed multi-feature MMN paradigms permit the objective assessment of discrimination accuracy for all the different auditory dimensions (such as frequency, intensity, and duration) in a short recording time of about 30 min. Most recently, such stimulus paradigms have been successfully developed for an objective assessment of music perception, too.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectExamining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectWe discuss a framework for brain plasticity.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectWe review the impact of musical training at different levels of the neural system.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectSeveral potential neurophysiological mechanisms could underlie music-induced brain plasticity.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectWe propose that cognitive transfer effects can be conceptualized as a multidimensional continuum.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectTraining programs aimed to alleviate or improve auditory-cognitive abilities have either experienced mixed success or remain to be fully validated. The limited benefits of such regimens are largely attributable to our weak understanding of (i) how (and which) interventions provide the most robust and long lasting improvements to cognitive and perceptual abilities and (ii) how the neural mechanisms which underlie such abilities are positively modified by certain activities and experience. Recent studies indicate that music training provides robust, long-lasting biological benefits to auditory function. Importantly, the behavioral advantages conferred by musical experience extend beyond simple enhancements to perceptual abilities and even impact non-auditory functions necessary for higher-order aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, intelligence). Collectively, preliminary findings indicate that alternative forms of arts engagement (e.g., visual arts training) may not yield such widespread enhancements, suggesting that music expertise uniquely taps and refines a hierarchy of brain networks subserving a variety of auditory as well as domain-general cognitive mechanisms. We infer that transfer from specific music experience to broad cognitive benefit might be mediated by the degree to which a listener's musical training tunes lower- (e.g., perceptual) and higher-order executive functions, and the coordination between these processes. Ultimately, understanding the broad impact of music on the brain will not only provide a more holistic picture of auditory processing and plasticity, but may help inform and tailor remediation and training programs designed to improve perceptual and cognitive benefits in human listeners.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Music: A window into the hearing brain>.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe minority of individuals afflicted with lifelong musical pitch deficits have been increasingly studied because they can help to reveal what is specific to music processing at all levels from behavior and brain to genes.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe core deficit of congenital amusia is characterized by a lack of awareness of acquired musical pitch knowledge.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe amusic brain shows abnormalities in neural transmission between the auditory cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus in the right cerebral hemisphere.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectConcerted activity over relatively distant specialized cortical regions is a fundamental neurobiological principle of human cognition.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe past decade of research has provided compelling evidence that musical engagement is a fundamental human trait, and its biological basis is increasingly scrutinized. In this endeavor, the detailed study of individuals who have musical deficiencies is instructive because of likely neurogenetic underpinnings. Such individuals have ‘congenital amusia’, an umbrella term for lifelong musical disabilities that cannot be attributed to intellectual disability, lack of exposure, or brain damage after birth. Key points are reviewed here that have emerged during recent years regarding the neurobiology of the disorder, focusing on the importance of recurrent processing between the right inferior frontal cortex and the auditory cortex for conscious monitoring of musical pitch, and how this relates to developmental cognitive disorders in general.The Effects of Sentence-Level Context, Prior Word Knowledge, and Need for Cognition on Information Processing of Technical Language in Print Ads - ScienceDirectAn experiment was conducted to examine the effects of sentence-level context, prior word knowledge, and need for cognition on responses to print ads for technical products. Words and phrases that help readers understand technical language in context increased the supportive arguments generated in response to ads, whereas prior word knowledge and need for cognition primarily influenced neutral thoughts. Only explanatory language facilitated the comprehension of product information. Explanatory language led to an increase in attitudes and purchase intent. Need for cognition had a positive influence on attitude formation when the context language was ambiguous, but decreased attitude formation when the context language was explanatory. Results are consistent with predictions guided by a comprehension elaboration model of persuasion.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectNormality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectRepresentations of normality are central to many aspects of cognition.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectFour studies explored the factors that influence normality representations.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectBoth descriptive and prescriptive judgments influenced normality representations.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectPeople’s beliefs about normality play an important role in many aspects of cognition and life (e.g., causal cognition, linguistic semantics, cooperative behavior). But how do people determine what sorts of things are normal in the first place? Past research has studied both people’s representations of statistical norms (e.g., the average) and their representations of prescriptive norms (e.g., the ideal). Four studies suggest that people’s notion of normality incorporates both of these types of norms. In particular, people’s representations of what is normal were found to be influenced both by what they believed to be descriptively average and by what they believed to be prescriptively ideal. This is shown across three domains: people’s use of the word “normal” (Study 1), their use of gradable adjectives (Study 2), and their judgments of concept prototypicality (Study 3). A final study investigated the learning of normality for a novel category, showing that people actively combine statistical and prescriptive information they have learned into an undifferentiated notion of what is normal (Study 4). Taken together, these findings may help to explain how moral norms impact the acquisition of normality and, conversely, how normality impacts the acquisition of moral norms.Effect of mindfulness meditation on brain–computer interface performance - ScienceDirectEffect of mindfulness meditation on brain–computer interface performance - ScienceDirectTraining in mindfulness meditation (MM) improves ability to control a BCI device.Effect of mindfulness meditation on brain–computer interface performance - ScienceDirectEquivalent expectations for improvement are elicited by MM and music training.Effect of mindfulness meditation on brain–computer interface performance - ScienceDirectBCI performance is better after MM rather than music training.Effect of mindfulness meditation on brain–computer interface performance - ScienceDirectExpectations cannot explain the effect of MM on BCI performance.Effect of mindfulness meditation on brain–computer interface performance - ScienceDirectElectroencephalogram based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) enable stroke and motor neuron disease patients to communicate and control devices. Mindfulness meditation has been claimed to enhance metacognitive regulation. The current study explores whether mindfulness meditation training can thus improve the performance of BCI users. To eliminate the possibility of expectation of improvement influencing the results, we introduced a music training condition. A norming study found that both meditation and music interventions elicited clear expectations for improvement on the BCI task, with the strength of expectation being closely matched. In the main 12 week intervention study, seventy-six healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups: a meditation training group; a music training group; and a no treatment control group. The mindfulness meditation training group obtained a significantly higher BCI accuracy compared to both the music training and no-treatment control groups after the intervention, indicating effects of meditation above and beyond expectancy effects.Hearing what the body feels: Auditory encoding of rhythmic movement - ScienceDirectPhillips-Silver and Trainor (Phillips-Silver, J., Trainor, L.J., (2005). Feeling the beat: movement influences infants’ rhythm perception. Science, 308, 1430) demonstrated an early cross-modal interaction between body movement and auditory encoding of musical rhythm in infants. Here we show that the way adults move their bodies to music influences their auditory perception of the rhythm structure. We trained adults, while listening to an ambiguous rhythm with no accented beats, to bounce by bending their knees to interpret the rhythm either as a march or as a waltz. At test, adults identified as similar an auditory version of the rhythm pattern with accented strong beats that matched their previous bouncing experience in comparison with a version whose accents did not match. In subsequent experiments we showed that this effect does not depend on visual information, but that movement of the body is critical. Parallel results from adults and infants suggest that the movement-sound interaction develops early and is fundamental to music processing throughout life.Hearing what the body feels: Auditory encoding of rhythmic movement - ScienceDirectThis manuscript was accepted under the editorship of Jacques Mehler.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectNonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectThis is the first work defining emotional changes in complexity in MDDs’ brains.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectHigher complexity values were generated by MDD patients relative to controlsNonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectThe patients had higher complexities during noise than did the controls’ brains.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectPatients’ negative emotional bias was showed by their higher brain complexities.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectAlthough patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have dysfunctions in cognitive behaviors and the regulation of emotions, the underlying brain dynamics of the pathophysiology are unclear. Therefore, nonlinear techniques can be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the EEG signals of MDD patients.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectTo investigate and clarify the dynamics of MDD patients׳ brains during different emotional states, EEG recordings were analyzed using nonlinear techniques. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether there are different EEG complexities that discriminate between MDD patients and healthy controls during emotional processing. Therefore, nonlinear parameters, such as Katz fractal dimension (KFD), Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), Shannon entropy (ShEn), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) and Kolmogorov complexity (KC), were computed from the EEG signals of two groups under different experimental states: noise (negative emotional content) and music (positive emotional content) periods.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectFirst, higher complexity values were generated by MDD patients relative to controls. Significant differences were obtained in the frontal and parietal scalp locations using KFD (p<0.001), HFD (p<0.05), and LZC (p=0.05). Second, lower complexities were observed only in the controls when they were subjected to music compared to the resting baseline state in the frontal (p<0.05) and parietal (p=0.005) regions. In contrast, the LZC and KFD values of patients increased in the music period compared to the resting state in the frontal region (p<0.05). Third, the patients׳ brains had higher complexities when they were exposed to noise stimulus than did the controls׳ brains. Moreover, MDD patients׳ negative emotional bias was demonstrated by their higher brain complexities during the noise period than the music stimulus. Additionally, we found that the KFD, HFD and LZC values were more sensitive in discriminating between patients and controls than the ShEn and KC measures, according to the results of ANOVA and ROC calculations.Nonlinear analysis of EEGs of patients with major depression during different emotional states - ScienceDirectIt can be concluded that the nonlinear analysis may be a useful and discriminative tool in investigating the neuro-dynamic properties of the brain in patients with MDD during emotional stimulation.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectAffective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectAltered reactivity to emotional distress is assumed to play a key role in CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectHowever, general mood induction did not reveal reactivity in CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectIndividualized mood induction did reveal affective and cognitive reactivity in CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectReactivity in CD thus depends on individual relevance.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectPsychotherapeutic tools are needed that decrease reactivity to memory activation.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectChronic depression (CD) is strongly associated with childhood maltreatment, which has been proposed to lead to inefficient coping styles that are characterized by abnormal affective responsiveness and dysfunctional cognitive attitudes. However, while this notion forms an important basis for psychotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of CD, there is still little direct empirical evidence for a role of altered affective and cognitive reactivity in CD. The present study therefore experimentally investigated affective and cognitive reactivity to two forms of negative mood induction in CD patients versus a healthy control sample (HC).Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectFor the general mood induction procedure, a combination of sad pictures and sad music was used, while for individualized mood induction, negative mood was induced by individualized scripts with autobiographical content. Both experiments included n = 15 CD patients versus n = 15 HC, respectively. Interactions between affective or cognitive reactivity and group were analyzed by repeated measurements ANOVAs.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectGeneral mood induction neither revealed affective nor cognitive reactivity in the patient group while the control group reported the expected decrease of positive affect [interaction (IA) affective reactivity x group: p = .011, cognitive reactivity x group: n.s.]. In contrast, individualized mood induction specifically increased affective reactivity (IA: p = .037) as well as the amount of dysfunctional cognitions in patients versus controls (IA: p = .014).Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectThe experiments were not balanced in a crossover design, causal conclusions are thus limited. Additionally, the differences to non-chronic forms of depression are still outstanding.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectThe results suggest that in patients with CD, specific emotional activation through autobiographical memories is a key factor in dysfunctional coping styles. Psychotherapeutic interventions aimed at modifying affective and cognitive reactivity are thus of high relevance in the treatment of CD.Reactions to music, touch and object presentation in the final stage of dementia. An exploratory study - ScienceDirectTwo patients in the final stage of dementia of Alzheimer type were stimulated with music, touch and object presentation during 12 consecutive days (16 trials per patient). Evaluations were made by direct observations, analysis of video-taped recordings and registrations of pulse and rate of respiration. Both patients reacted differently to music than to touch and object presentation.Jungle boogie - ScienceDirectIs music universal?

The objective of this study was a community-based investigation of FLAIR-hyperintense lesion volumes (LV) and their association with CI in patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS. The neurocognitive assessment was conducted with the brief cognitive screening instrument, MUSIC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained with a 1.5 Tesla Sigma Magnetom MRI scanner. We conducted a stepwise multiple regression analysis to assess the relative contribution of the main clinical, demographic and MRI-variables in predicting cognitive impairment. We recruited 78 patients with RRMS. The mean MUSIC score was 20.6 ± 5.4. Forty five percent of patients (n = 35, mean score 15.1 ± 3.3) had CI and 55% (n = 43, mean score 24.4 ± 2.5) had no sign of CI. In the correlation analysis of the MUSIC subtests only the interference test correlated negatively with the LV (r = −0.23). Multivariate linear regression analysis using MUSIC as the dependent continuous variable revealed LV and disability severity as independent factors associated with MUSIC (p value of the regression model < 0.001; adjusted R-square = 0.11). The results of the present study suggest an association between white matter damage and CI in MS. We could demonstrate an association between attention difficulties and the LV in MS patients.Association of cognitive impairment and lesion volumes in multiple sclerosis – A MRI study - ScienceDirectTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01250665 and NCT01250678.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectThis study aims to show that the specific use of sad music in patients with major depressive disorder can circumvent the verbal barrier they typically experience when asked to express their emotions.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectWe examined the effect of four emotionally distinctive types of music (i.e. happiness, fear, anger, and sadness) on 14 hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder (MDD group) and 31 healthy controls (HC group). Participants were asked to choose emotional descriptors that expressed the feelings that were induced in them by each excerpt. We hypothesized that in the specific case of sad music, patients with MDD would describe the music more vividly than HC participants.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectPatients with MDD chose fewer emotional labels than controls in response to angry, scary, and happy excerpts. Patients with MDD and controls chose similar emotional labels in response to sad music, but patients with MDD chose more labels in response to sad music than to any other excerpt, while controls demonstrated the exact opposite pattern.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectThese findings are in line with clinical descriptions of patients with MDD as demonstrating difficulties in verbalizing their emotions. Their intensified response to sad music is in accordance with their focus on sad cues. The use of sad music in psychotherapy is thus recommended as means of bypassing the verbal barrier experienced by patients with MDD.Efficacité de la musicothérapie sur la résilience dans la maladie d’Alzheimer - ScienceDirectLe but de cet article est de présenter les résultats de la musicothérapie et d’analyser certains de ses effets sur des patients atteints de maladie d’Alzheimer ou des troubles cognitifs organiques apparentés.

Music therapy continues to produce well-being for the patient in the advanced stages of the illness. It is effective in supporting the patient's resilience and that of their caregivers. The underlying mechanisms of this type of therapy are clarified. The music therapy adds meaning to care and contributes to preventing psychosocial risks.Efficacité de la musicothérapie sur la résilience dans la maladie d’Alzheimer - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music therapy research II: Research methods suitable for music therapy - ScienceDirectDavid Aldridge, a research consultant to the medical faculty of Universität Witten Herdecke, Germany, is also European Editor of The Arts in Psychotherapy.Phenomenology of rhythm in design - ScienceDirectRhythm in design, as explored in this research, is proposed to be the result of cognitive performance generated stylistically by creators and recognized consciously by beholders. This study describes the phenomenon of rhythm; how it is created; the factors that comprise rhythm; the types of rhythms created by human cognition of repetition, and why repetition is recognized as a part of human cognition. Images of seven buildings designed by Alvar Aalto are used to demonstrate the creation and expression of rhythm in building compositions. Evidence gathered in this research explains that rhythm in design is a result of the design method consciously applied by human cognition of repetition. Rules of generating the phenomena of rhythm are also summarized. Designers could apply these rules to generate harmonious patterns through the effective usage of repetition. In sum, rhythm is ingrained in the human conscience and therefore should be a key component of design applied universally.Phenomenology of rhythm in design - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Southeast University.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectCorrelations between subjective, conscious, spontaneous cognitions and EEG power spectral profiles were investigated in 20 normal volunteers (2 sessions each) during relaxation-drowsiness-sleep onset. Four-channel EEG (temporal-parietal and parietal-central, left and right) was continuously recorded. The subjects were prompted 15 times per session to give brief reports of their ongoing thoughts. The reports were rated on 23 scales, and the 16 seconds of EEG recording preceding the prompts were spectral analyzed. Canonical correlation analysis was applied to the data (23 cognition ratings and 124 EEG spectral values for each of the 538 prompts). Four of the 23 pairs of canonical EEG variables and cognition variables were significant (p < 0.016) with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 to 0.62. The four pairs of canonical variables showed distinctive features in EEG spectra and cognition styles. The results demonstrate ruleful correspondances between EEG states and spontaneous, conscious, covert, cognitive-emotional states in a no-input, no-task, no-response paradigm.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectHome institution: Department of Drug Safety Assessment, SANDOZ, Basel, Switzerland.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.Effects of a best-possible-self mental imagery exercise on mood and dysfunctional attitudes - ScienceDirectDispositional optimism has been related to positive physical and mental health outcomes, increased positive mood ratings and cognitions about the future. In order to determine the causal relation between optimism and mood and cognitions optimism should be manipulated experimentally. The current study tested the effects of a best-possible-self mental imagery exercise on affect and mood ratings and dysfunctional cognitions following a sad mood induction in undergraduate students (N=40). Participants in the experimental condition wrote about their best possible self in the future for 15 min and engaged in a mental imagery task about their best possible self in the future for 5 min in order to experimentally induce optimism. Participants in the control condition wrote about a typical day for 15 min and engaged in mental imagery about a typical day for 5 min. We assessed affect, mood and dysfunctional cognitions before and after the experimental manipulation. Participants in the experimental condition had higher positive mood ratings and higher positive affect compared to participants in the control condition. Participants in the control condition reported decreased dysfunctional cognitions whereas dysfunctional cognitions in the experimental group remained unchanged. Future studies should replicate these findings in clinical groups with more profound levels of negative affect and dysfunctional cognitions.Can concurrent verbalization reveal design cognition? - ScienceDirectWe advance a view that design is a combination of many types of thinking, maintaining that concurrent verbal reports are best at revealing particular types of thinking (specifically the short term focus of the designer). There are two issues of using concurrent verbal reports to elicit types of design thinking: (1) do the words ‘thought aloud’ accurately reflect the design thinking? (2) does a concurrent verbal methodology actually affect the designing it seeks to reveal? In our analysis of Dan's protocol we show how the interaction between design problem and design solution is effectively handled by Dan- and revealed by concurrent verbalization — but how aspects of design thinking such as perception and insight, are not elicited by concurrent verbalization. We go on to show how the design task changes as a result of the designer having to continually think aloud, with ‘normal’ activities like negotiation and displacement being impaired. We conclude by identifying a need for protocol analysis in design to be specific about the questions it addresses.Delirium in the Elderly - ScienceDirectDisclosure Statement: The authors have no conflicts of interest and no relationships or financial interests to disclose.Music draws attention to the left and speech draws attention to the right - ScienceDirectProviding free-field music input prompts right-handers to attend to their left side in a loudness-matching task that requires no musical analysis. Conversely, speech prompts rightward attention. The processes inferred are akin to the attentional asymmetry demonstrated in the syndrome of hemispatial neglect.Music draws attention to the left and speech draws attention to the right - ScienceDirectPresented at the International Neuropsychological Society meeting in Houston, TX, February (1984).Music draws attention to the left and speech draws attention to the right - ScienceDirectThis research was conducted with the aid of Grant A0695 from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.Utilizing linguistically enhanced keystroke dynamics to predict typist cognition and demographics - ScienceDirectUtilizing linguistically enhanced keystroke dynamics to predict typist cognition and demographics - ScienceDirectRecognition of cognitive task with linguistic and keystroke features with accuracy of 72.39%.Utilizing linguistically enhanced keystroke dynamics to predict typist cognition and demographics - ScienceDirectRecognition of gender, handedness, and native-language from short unconstrained text at F1=.462, 0.223, and 0.524, respectively.Utilizing linguistically enhanced keystroke dynamics to predict typist cognition and demographics - ScienceDirectDeveloped novel Language Production features hybridizing keystroke dynamics and stylometry.Utilizing linguistically enhanced keystroke dynamics to predict typist cognition and demographics - ScienceDirectEntering information on a computer keyboard is a ubiquitous mode of expression and communication. We investigate whether typing behavior is connected to two factors: the cognitive demands of a given task and the demographic features of the typist. We utilize features based on keystroke dynamics, stylometry, and “language production”, which are novel hybrid features that capture the dynamics of a typists linguistic choices. Our study takes advantage of a large data set (~350 subjects) made up of relatively short samples (~450 characters) of free text. Experiments show that these features can recognize the cognitive demands of task that an unseen typist is engaged in, and can classify his or her demographics with better than chance accuracy. We correctly distinguish High vs. Low cognitively demanding tasks with accuracy up to 72.39%. Detection of non-native speakers of English is achieved with F1=0.462 over a baseline of 0.166, while detection of female typists reaches F1=0.524 over a baseline of 0.442. Recognition of left-handed typists achieves F1=0.223 over a baseline of 0.100. Further analyses reveal that novel relationships exist between language production as manifested through typing behavior, and both cognitive and demographic factors.Utilizing linguistically enhanced keystroke dynamics to predict typist cognition and demographics - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Keith Vertanen.That note sounds wrong!

Age-related effects in processing of musical expectation - ScienceDirectEEG source was more widespread in older adults, consistent with dedifferentiation.That note sounds wrong! Age-related effects in processing of musical expectation - ScienceDirectOlder adults refine their implicit knowledge of musical syntax throughout life.That note sounds wrong! Age-related effects in processing of musical expectation - ScienceDirectPart of musical understanding and enjoyment stems from the ability to accurately predict what note (or one of a small set of notes) is likely to follow after hearing the first part of a melody. Selective violation of expectations can add to aesthetic response but radical or frequent violations are likely to be disliked or not comprehended. In this study we investigated whether a lifetime of exposure to music among untrained older adults would enhance their reaction to unexpected endings of unfamiliar melodies. Older and younger adults listened to melodies that had expected or unexpected ending notes, according to Western music theory. Ratings of goodness-of-fit were similar in the groups, as was ERP response to the note onset (N1). However, in later time windows (P200 and Late Positive Component), the amplitude of a response to unexpected and expected endings was both larger in older adults, corresponding to greater sensitivity, and more widespread in locus, consistent with a dedifferentiation pattern. Lateralization patterns also differed. We conclude that older adults refine their understanding of this important aspect of music throughout life, with the ability supported by changing patterns of neural activity.A Spatial Dance to the Music of Time in the Leks of Long-Tailed Manakins - ScienceDirectLong-tailed manakins (Aves, Pipridae) have a lek mating system with obligate dual-male courtship display. Temporal and spatial factors shape many aspects of male social organization. At daily, seasonal and lifetime temporal scales, the life history schedules of males are “stretched,” such that males attain partner status only when they are eight or older, and female choice assesses a long term running average of dual-male performance at the scale of months or years. Relative invulnerability to predation may explain some differences between long-tailed manakins and other lek-mating species. Male and female use of space affects male–female and male–male relationships. I propose that male–male cooperation may be favored by either or both of two mechanisms. The first is that the spatial acuity of female choice and consequent unanimity of female choice may restrict options for young males and favor delayed benefits derived from enhancing a lek's reputation. The second is that stable long term associations of males, at stable, predictably located lek arenas, may shift the balance from tolerance of neighbors and mutualistic antipredator avoidance to active cooperation in courtship.Social Cognition: Feeling Voices to Recognize Emotions - ScienceDirectOur understanding of how we simulate other people's actions and feelings to recognize their emotional states is extended by a new study which finds that premotor and somatosensory cortices are required to process the emotional meaning of sounds.Reflections on Jacques Paillard (1920–2006) — A pioneer in the field of motor cognition - ScienceDirectThis article reviews the scientific contributions of Jacques Paillard (1920–2006), who strengthened substantially the role of physiological psychology in the field of movement neuroscience. His research began in 1947 under the direction of the French neurophysiologist, Alfred Fessard (1900–1982), with whom he then collaborated for 9 years while an undergraduate and then graduate student and junior faculty member in psychology at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). Paillard moved to the University of Marseille in 1957 as a Professor of Psychophysiology. In parallel, he became a founding member and administrator of the Institute of Neurophysiology and Psychophysiology, which began in 1963 on the Marseille campus of the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS). Paillard retired from his university and CNRS positions in 1991 but he continued seminal research until his demise. Paillard advanced understanding of higher brain influences on human spinal motor mechanisms and the functional role of proprioception as revealed in patients deprived of such sensibility. He remains best known, however, for his work on human motor cognition. He reasoned that brain “maps” of the external world are constructed by the body's own movements and the central effects of their resulting central and peripheral feedback. He proposed two levels of interactive brain processing for the planning and/or execution of a reaching movement: 1) a sensorimotor level, using body posture as a key reference; and 2) a “higher” cognitive level for accurate movement performance, using learned representations of the position and shape of the environmental components, including the body, itself.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectOld songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectPeople process the meaning of song lyrics in natural song perception.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectPeople continue processing the meaning of lyrics even when they are familiar with the songs.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectSong lyrics may be different from regular speech.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectSong familiarity has been systematically found to have a strong effect on music cognition, especially in aspects of emotion and memory; however, whether it would also influence the semantic processing of song lyrics is unclear. To address this, we asked subjects to listen to familiar and unfamiliar pop song excerpts, which were followed by visual target words semantically related or unrelated to the lyrics-final word, and to judge the concreteness of the targets. The ERP results revealed that larger N400 was elicited by unrelated visual targets compared with related ones, indicating that the subjects processed the meaning of the preceding lyrics even though that was not part of the required task. More importantly, the N400 relatedness effect did not vary with subjects' familiarity with the songs, suggesting that the subjects kept processing the meaning of the lyrics even though they had listened to the songs multiple times. The fact that repetition—the essential characteristic of familiar songs—did not diminish the meaning processing of lyrics suggests that lyrics and speech may differ at a higher communicative level.An exploratory study of children's music ability - ScienceDirectThis research examined the relationships between children's musical ability and the physical and social environments of the home and school as well as the child characteristics of creativity and cognition. Teacher and parent ratings were included as measures of children's musical ability observed in the natural home and school settings, as comparisons to the standardized Primary Measures of Music Audiation (PMMA) measurement (Gordon, 1979). Sixty children between the ages of 4 and 6 and their parents participated in the study. The findings of this study include significant positive relationships of children's musical aptitude with fathers' attitude and encouragement, and the child characteristics of cognitive and creative abilities. Significant correlations of the PMMA were found with several physical environment variables. Regression analysis demonstrated that cognitive ability was the only significant predictor of musical aptitude. However, when parent and teacher ratings were used as measures of children's musical ability, the social home environment was the significant predictor variable in the regression models.The integration of cognition and emotion during infancy and early childhood: Regulatory processes associated with the development of working memory - ScienceDirectThis study was an attempt to integrate cognitive development (i.e., cognitive control) and emotional development (i.e., emotion regulation) in the first years of life. The construct of temperament was used to unify cognition and emotion because of its focus on attentional and regulatory behaviors. Children were seen at 8 months and 412-years of age in a study designed to examine the correlates of working memory development. Frontal brain electrical activity and temperament predicted working memory performance at 8 months. Similarly, frontal brain electrical activity, temperament, and language predicted working memory at age 412-years. Temperament in early childhood mediated the relation between infant temperament and early childhood working memory performance. These associated temperament characteristics highlight the value of early-learned regulatory and attentional behaviors and the impact of these early skills on later development.Anchoring effects in music: The resolution of dissonance - ScienceDirectMost pieces of music induce in the listener a sense that some pitches sound consonant, stable, or final, while others sound more dissonant, unstable, or transient. A psychological account of the intuition that the dissonance of an unstable tone is sometimes “resolved” by following it by a stable tone that is close in pitch is provided. The perceived hierarchy differentiating tones on the basis of stability may be construed as a cognitive schema, which facilitates the encoding of some tones relative to others. A cognitive principle, melodic anchoring, which specifies the ordered relationships (between tones) that govern (i) the activation of one tonal schema over another and (ii) the assimilation or anchoring of unstable tones to the tonal schema once it has been activated is presented. In a forcedchoice paradigm, the principle is invoked to predict which chord is perceived to “underlie” a sequence that is tonally ambiguous in all respects except the ordered relationships between its tones. In a same-different task, subjects were presented with a pair of tonal sequences. When a stable tone was replaced by an unstable tone, more confusions occurred when the latter was anchored than when it was not. The accuracy advantage when the unstable tone was in the comparison as opposed to the standard sequence was lower when the unstable tone was anchored than when it was not. Finally, subjects rated how well a sequence and a chord sounded together. Melodies that contained an unstable tone were given higher ratings when the unstable tone was anchored than when it was not. Each paradigm was used to demonstrate first immediate and then delayed anchoring.Anchoring effects in music: The resolution of dissonance - ScienceDirectThis paper is based on a PhD dissertation at Harvard University.

Krumhansl.Musical deficits and cortical thickness in people with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectInvestigation of acquired amusia caused by brain damage suggested that cortical lesions of the right hemisphere contributed to musical deficits. We previously reported reduced musical ability in schizophrenia; these deficits were correlated with clinical manifestations such as cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms. However, the neural substrate underlying the musical disability in schizophrenia remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between musical deficits and cortical thickness in patients with schizophrenia using structural MRI. We recruited 24 patients (13 males; age mean = 45.9 years old), and 22 controls (14 males, age mean = 43.5 years old). Musical ability was assessed with the Montreal Battery for Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), cognitive function with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and clinical features of illness with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). MRI Images were acquired and processed using FreeSurfer. Surface-based analysis showed that thinner cortex in left temporal and inferior frontal region was associated with lower musical ability in schizophrenia. In contrast, in controls thicker cortex in the left supramarginal region was correlated with lower musical ability. These results shed light on the clinical pathology underlying the associations of musical ability, cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectTask-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have revealed various ADHD-related dysfunctional brain regions, with heterogeneous findings across studies. Here, we used novel meta-analytic data-driven approaches to characterize the function and connectivity profile of ADHD-related dysfunctional regions consistently detected across studies.Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectWe first conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 24 task-based fMRI studies in adults with ADHD. Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on ~7500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional coactivation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling).Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectADHD-related hypoactivation was found in the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and the left temporal lobe to language semantics; both these regions clustered together on the basis of their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped to both executive function tasks and music-related processes.Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectOur study provides meta-analytic support to the hypothesis that, in addition to well-known deficits in typical executive functions, impairment in processes related to music perception/reproduction and language semantics may be involved in the pathophysiology of adult ADHD.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMelodic expectancy influences the processing of prosodic expectancy.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusical expertise modulates pitch processing in music and language.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusicians have a more refined response to pitch.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusicians' neural responses are proportional to their level of musical expertise.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectPossible association between the P200 neural component and behavioural facilitation.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectCurrent research on music processing and syntax or semantics in language suggests that music and language share partially overlapping neural resources. Pitch also constitutes a common denominator, forming melody in music and prosody in language. Further, pitch perception is modulated by musical training. The present study investigated how music and language interact on pitch dimension and whether musical training plays a role in this interaction. For this purpose, we used melodies ending on an expected or unexpected note (melodic expectancy being estimated by a computational model) paired with prosodic utterances which were either expected (statements with falling pitch) or relatively unexpected (questions with rising pitch). Participants' (22 musicians, 20 nonmusicians) ERPs and behavioural responses in a statement/question discrimination task were recorded. Participants were faster for simultaneous expectancy violations in the melodic and linguistic stimuli. Further, musicians performed better than nonmusicians, which may be related to their increased pitch tracking ability. At the neural level, prosodic violations elicited a front-central positive ERP around 150 ms after the onset of the last word/note, while musicians presented reduced P600 in response to strong incongruities (questions on low-probability notes). Critically, musicians' P800 amplitudes were proportional to their level of musical training, suggesting that expertise might shape the pitch processing of language. The beneficial aspect of expertise could be attributed to its strengthening effect of general executive functions. These findings offer novel contributions to our understanding of shared higher-order mechanisms between music and language processing on pitch dimension, and further demonstrate a potential modulation by musical expertise.Cognitive representation of “musical fractals”: Processing hierarchy and recursion in the auditory domain - ScienceDirectThe human ability to process hierarchical structures has been a longstanding research topic. However, the nature of the cognitive machinery underlying this faculty remains controversial. Recursion, the ability to embed structures within structures of the same kind, has been proposed as a key component of our ability to parse and generate complex hierarchies. Here, we investigated the cognitive representation of both recursive and iterative processes in the auditory domain. The experiment used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm: participants were exposed to three-step processes in which pure-tone sequences were built either through recursive or iterative processes, and had to choose the correct completion. Foils were constructed according to generative processes that did not match the previous steps. Both musicians and non-musicians were able to represent recursion in the auditory domain, although musicians performed better. We also observed that general ‘musical’ aptitudes played a role in both recursion and iteration, although the influence of musical training was somehow independent from melodic memory. Moreover, unlike iteration, recursion in audition was well correlated with its non-auditory (recursive) analogues in the visual and action sequencing domains. These results suggest that the cognitive machinery involved in establishing recursive representations is domain-general, even though this machinery requires access to information resulting from domain-specific processes.Embodied Processes between Maths and Gross-motor Skills - ScienceDirectOver the last fifteen years, in several research areas, there has been a lot of studies about “embodied” cognition, ie the emerging view that considers cognitive processes deeply rooted in the interaction of the body with the world (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999). Starting from this theoretical framework and from a previous study that evaluated the possible correlations between gross motor skills and marks at school, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible correlation between Maths and TGMD (Dale Urich, 1992) results. Through statistical analysis, the results showed some interesting positive correlation between these two variables, confirming the results of previous research and opening up some interesting reflections on the introductory basis theories.Embodied Processes between Maths and Gross-motor Skills - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Social Cognition: Some Historical and Theoretical Perspectives - ScienceDirectSocial cognition is established to serve as a new forum for the ever increasing numbers of investigations. This chapter examines the current theories of social cognition and the intellectual history out of which social cognition has arisen. It also reveals the pervasive and continuing influence of two generic traditions within psychology: associationism and constructionism. It is salutary in the development of social cognition to explore its intellectual history, its associationist, and its constructionist traditions to address the question of whether or not social cognition represents an important theoretical advance. In the chapter, the roots of associationism as well as its present application in social cognition research and the roots of constructionism and its present application in social cognition research are also explored. The central concerns of cognitive psychology are representation and processing. These issues require the building and testing of theoretical constructs and models. The formation or processing of representations is directly observed and introspection regarding cognitive processes is problematic. The chapter also focuses on those investigations of social cognition that explicitly apply associationist or constructionist theory.Cognitive priming in sung and instrumental music: Activation of inferior frontal cortex - ScienceDirectNeural correlates of the processing of musical syntax-like structures have been investigated via expectancy violation due to musically unrelated (i.e., unexpected) events in musical contexts. Previous studies reported the implication of inferior frontal cortex in musical structure processing. However – due to the strong musical manipulations – activations might be explained by sensory deviance detection or repetition priming. Our present study investigated neural correlates of musical structure processing with subtle musical violations in a musical priming paradigm. Instrumental and sung sequences ended on related and less-related musical targets. The material controlled sensory priming components, and differences in target processing required listeners' knowledge on musical structures. Participants were scanned with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while performing speeded phoneme and timbre identification judgments on the targets. Behavioral results acquired in the scanner replicated the facilitation effect of related over less-related targets. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal linked to target processing revealed activation of right inferior frontal areas (i.e., inferior frontal gyrus, frontal operculum, anterior insula) that was stronger for less-related than for related targets, and this was independent of the material carrying the musical structures. This outcome points to the implication of inferior frontal cortex in the processing of syntactic relations also for musical material and to its role in the processing and integration of sequential information over time. In addition to inferior frontal activation, increased activation was observed in orbital gyrus, temporal areas (anterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, posterior middle temporal gyrus) and supramarginal gyrus.Neuroscience-Inspired, Behavioral Change Program for University Students - ScienceDirectThe authors have nothing to disclose.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectAmbivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectConfigurations of inclusion, exclusion, and ambivalence define musical boundary forms.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectGenre measured indirectly by respondent classifications of favorite and least favorite artists.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectPrimary contrast in the musical field is drawing boundaries between versus within genres.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectSecondary contrast in the musical field defined by those who are indifferent to major genres.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectComparative netfield analysis connects individual-level and field-level analysis.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectThis study offers a reconceptualization of social and symbolic boundaries around music by specifying combinations of inclusion, exclusion, and ambivalence in musical tastes, producing eight ideal-typical forms of musical boundaries. These forms are investigated using data from a survey of students at the University of Mississippi measuring implicit boundary processes through respondent genre classifications of favorite and least favorite artists. These data are analyzed using comparative netfield analysis, a combination of comparative and relational methods that provides a mixed methods framework for connecting interpretations of individual-level processes to a map of the socio-musical field. The main opposition found in this musical field is between divider and ambivalent boundary forms, i.e., those who draw boundaries between versus within genres. A secondary opposition is defined by those who are indifferent to major genres. Case studies suggest that musical boundaries are often organized around racialized and gendered genre categories. I draw implications for studies of omnivorousness, genre classification, and mixed methods analysis in cultural sociology.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectJohn Sonnett is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Mississippi.

Reducing severe negative symptoms (SNS) in a clinically relevant way is a major unmet need. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Integrated Neurocognitive Therapy (INT), a group cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), reduces SNS in schizophrenia outpatients. INT was compared with Treatment As Usual (TAU) in a randomized-controlled trial (RCT). A total of 61 SNS outpatients participated in the study, 28 were allocated to the INT group and 33 to the TAU group. A test-battery was used at baseline, post-treatment at 15 weeks, and 1-year-follow-up. Remission rates of SNS after therapy were significantly higher for INT compared to TAU. A trend favoring INT was obtained at follow-up. Furthermore, INT showed significantly higher functional outcome during follow-up compared to TAU. Regarding cognition, the strongest significant effect was found in attention post-treatment. No effects between groups on more complex neurocognition and social cognition were evident. SNS outpatients seem to accept INT group intervention as suggested by the high attendance rate.Optimal Distinctiveness Theory: A Framework for Social Identity, Social Cognition, and Intergroup Relations - ScienceDirectOptimal distinctiveness theory [Brewer, M. B. (1991). The social self: on being the same and different at the same time. Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin, 17(5), 475–482] proposes that individuals have two fundamental and competing human needs—the need for inclusion and the need for differentiation—that can be met by membership in moderately inclusive (optimally distinct) groups. In this chapter, the optimal distinctiveness model and its origins are summarized, and theoretical extensions and empirical tests of the model are discussed. In particular, the empirical review summarizes the model's consequences for social identification, social cognition, and intergroup relations. The evidence strongly supports the notion that the needs for inclusion and differentiation influence self-categorization resulting in a curvilinear relation between group inclusiveness and group identification. The existing evidence also indicates that the two needs influence perceptions and judgments of the self and others and the nature of intragroup and intergroup relations. The chapter concludes by discussing the interplay of the needs for inclusion and differentiation across levels of the self and how the needs for inclusion and differentiation influence which level of self (individual or collective) is motivationally primary.Experience in Teaching Practice of Pre-service Teachers: Analysis of Written Reflections - ScienceDirectTeacher training institutions have a mission of high responsibility to train competitive educators for change and future schools. Researchers highlight the need for relation between theory and practice as well as interaction between personal and professional experiences. The article reveals the characteristics of personal professional experience gained in accomplishment of objectives of teaching practice by students studying music pedagogy. The analysis of written reflections highlights positive and negative factors that may have impact on implementation of students’ pedagogical competencies during their teaching practice.Experience in Teaching Practice of Pre-service Teachers: Analysis of Written Reflections - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of WCES 2014.Development of constructivist theory of mind from middle childhood to early adulthood and its relation to social cognition and behavior - ScienceDirectTwo studies examined the development of constructivist theory of mind (ToM) during late childhood and early adolescence. In Study 1, a new measure was developed to assess participants’ understanding of the interpretive and constructive processes embedded in memory, comprehension, attention, comparison, planning, and inference. Using this measure, Study 2 tested a mediational model in which prosocial reasoning about conflict mediated the relation between constructivist ToM and behavior problems in high school. Results showed that the onset of constructivist ToM occurs between late childhood and early adolescence and that adolescents who have more advanced constructivist ToM have more prosocial reasoning about conflict, which in turn mediated the relation with fewer serious behavior problems in high school, after controlling for academic performance and sex. In both studies, girls showed more advanced constructivist ToM than boys in high school.Does active leisure protect cognition? Evidence from a national birth cohort - ScienceDirectSocial, physical and intellectual activities are thought to facilitate cognitive performance and slow the rate of age associated cognitive decline, but little is known about this association in younger adulthood. We used multiple regression to test the association between two kinds of activity at 36 years—physical exercise and spare-time activity—and verbal memory at 43 and 53 years in 1919 males and females enrolled in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort). Both kinds of activities were significantly and positively associated with memory performance at 43 years, after controlling for sex, education, occupational social class, IQ at 15 years, and recurrent ill health and significant mental distress. Furthermore, physical exercise at 36 years (but not spare-time activity) was associated with a significantly slower rate of decline in memory from 43 to 53 years, after controlling for the same factors, with evidence that continuing physical exercise after 36 years was important for protection. We conclude that physical exercise and spare-time activity are significantly associated with benefit to memory in midlife, although these two kinds of voluntary activity may exert their effects on cognition via different paths.Effects of multisensory stimulation on cognition, depression and anxiety levels of mildly-affected alzheimer's patients - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to investigate and assess the effects of musical therapy, painting inanimate–animate object pictures, and orientation to time–place–person interventions on the cognitive state, depression, and anxiety levels of mildly-affected Alzheimer's patients.Effects of multisensory stimulation on cognition, depression and anxiety levels of mildly-affected alzheimer's patients - ScienceDirectThe study using a quasi-experimental design was conducted with 27 mildly-affected Alzheimer's patients. The effects of the multisensory stimulation were evaluated with the “Mini Mental State Examination,” the “Geriatric Depression Scale,” and the “Beck Anxiety Scale.” All of these were administered one day prior to beginning the study, immediately after its completion, and three weeks thereafter.Effects of multisensory stimulation on cognition, depression and anxiety levels of mildly-affected alzheimer's patients - ScienceDirectA significant negative correlation was determined to exist between the MMSE–depression scores and MMSE–anxiety scores; the correlation between the depression–anxiety scores, on the other hand, had a positive significance. The shifts over time in the MMSE, depression and anxiety scores were significant.Effects of multisensory stimulation on cognition, depression and anxiety levels of mildly-affected alzheimer's patients - ScienceDirectThe primary conclusion of the study is that the multisensory stimulation method applied to mildly-affected Alzheimer's patients had a positive effect on their cognitive state, depression, and anxiety, and that this effect continued for three weeks following completion of the study intervention, with a tendency to decline progressively.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectPsychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLatinos improved on panic disorder severity and asthma control in both groups.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectCBT had greater improvements on asthma medication adherence than music-relaxation.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectImprovements in panic disorder severity were mediated by anxiety sensitivity in CBT.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectDepression was a mediator of change in panic disorder severity in music-relaxation.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectConfusion between panic and asthma symptoms can result in serious self-management errors. A cognitive behavior psychophysiological therapy (CBPT) intervention was culturally adapted for Latinos consisting of CBT for panic disorder (PD), asthma education, differentiation between panic and asthma symptoms, and heart rate variability biofeedback. An RCT compared CBPT to music and relaxation therapy (MRT), which included listening to relaxing music and paced breathing at resting respiration rates. Fifty-three Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) adults with asthma and PD were randomly assigned to CBPT or MRT for 8 weekly sessions. Both groups showed improvements in PD severity, asthma control, and several other anxiety and asthma outcome measures from baseline to post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. CBPT showed an advantage over MRT for improvement in adherence to inhaled corticosteroids. Improvements in PD severity were mediated by anxiety sensitivity in CBPT and by depression in MRT, although earlier levels of these mediators did not predict subsequent improvements. Attrition was high (40%) in both groups, albeit comparable to CBT studies targeting anxiety in Latinos. Additional strategies are needed to improve retention in this high-risk population. Both CBPT and MRT may be efficacious interventions for comorbid asthma-PD, and CBPT may offer additional benefits for improving medication adherence.On the computational basis of learning and cognition: Arguments from LSA - ScienceDirectThis chapter discusses the computational basis of learning and cognition. To deal with a continuously changing environment, living things have three choices: (1) evolve unvarying processes that usually succeed, (2) evolve genetically fixed effector, perceptual, and computational functions that are contingent on the environment, and (3) learn adaptive functions during their lifetimes. The theme of this chapter is the relation between (2) and (3): the nature of evolutionarily determined computational processes that support learning. The principal goal of this chapter has been to suggest that high-dimensional vector space computations based on empirical associations among very large numbers of components could be a close model of a fundamental computational basis of most learning in both verbal and perceptual domains. More powerful representational effects can be brought about by linear inductive combinations of the elements of very large vocabularies than has often been realized. Success of one such model to demonstrate many natural properties of language commonly assumed to be essentially more complex, nonlinear, and/or unlearned, along with evidence and argument that similar computations may serve similar roles in object recognition, are taken to reaffirm the possibility that a single underlying associational mechanism lies behind many more special and complex appearing cognitive phenomena.Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectThe judgement of healthy subject rating the emotional expressions of a set of schematic drawn faces is validated (study 1) to examine the relationship between mood (depressed/elated) and judgement of emotional expressions of these faces (study 2).Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectStudy 1: 30 healthy subjects judged 12 faces with respect to the emotions they express (fear, happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, rejection and invitation). It was found that a particular face could reflect various emotions. All eigth emotions were reflected in the set of faces and the emotions were consensually judged. Moreover, gender differences in judgement could be established.Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectStudy 2: In a cross-over design, 24 healthy subjects judged the faces after listening to depressing or elating music. The faces were subdivided in six ‘ambiguous’ faces (i.e., expressing similar amounts of positive and negative emotions) and six ‘clear’ faces (i.e., faces showing a preponderance of positive or negative emotions). In addition, these two types of faces were distinguished with respect to the intensity of emotions they express.Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirect11 subjects who showed substantial differences in experienced depression after listening to the music were selected for further analysis. It was found that, when feeling more depressed, the subjects perceived more rejection/sadness in ambiguous faces (displaying less intensive emotions) and less invitation/happiness in clear faces. In addition, subjects saw more fear in clear faces that express less intensive emotions. Hence, results show a depression-related negative bias in the perception of facial displays.Apical dendrite activity in cognition and consciousness - ScienceDirectThe ongoing steady nature of consciousness in everyday life implies that the underlying neural activity possesses a high level of stability. The prolonged cognitive events of sustained attention, imagery, and working memory also imply high stability of underlying neural activity. This paper proposes that stabilization of neural activity is produced by apical dendrite activity in pyramidal neurons within recurrent corticothalamic circuits, and proposes that the wave activities of apical dendrites that stabilize ongoing activity constitute the subjective impressions of an attended object and the entire sensory background. The cortical minicolumn, as the functional unit of the cortex, is separated into an axis consisting of layer 5 pyramidal neurons and a surrounding shell consisting of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. It is proposed that apical dendrites of the axis generate sensory impressions, and basal dendrites of the shell process the brief-lasting input–output identifications of objects that give rise to ideas.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectThe style of a set of Swedish nursery tunes is described in terms of a generative rule system. A generative rule system producing melodically similar versions of an old Swedish folk song is also presented. Examples of melodies generated by these two rule systems are given.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectBoth these rule systems are similar in several respects. Thus, the marking of the hierarchical constituent structure seems to be one of the important principles in composing simple melodies.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectThe rule systems also show a number of similarities with the Chomsky & Halle (1968) generative phonology of English. For instance, the procedures used for deriving a stress contour from a tree diagram are almost identical. Moreover, in sentences as in melodies this stress, or prominence contour is of decisive importance to the generation of the surface structure, such as meter, harmony, and sequences of pitches. It is believed that such parallels between language and music reflect characteristics of man's perceptual and cognitive capacities.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectOn décrit un ensemble de comptines suédoises en termes de système génératif de règles. On présente un autre système génératif produisant des versions mélodiques analogues d'un chant folklorique suédois. On donne divers exemples de mélodies générées par les deux systèmes.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectCes deux systèmes ont des aspects similaires. Ainsi le marquage des composants hiérarchiques de la structure semble être l'un des principes importants dans la composition de mélodies simples.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectDes systèmes de règles ont également quelques similitudes avec la phonologie générative anglaise de Chomsky et Halle (1968). Par exemple, ce sont des procédures de même nature qui sont utilisées dans la dérivation de l'accentuation à partir d'un diagramme en arbre. De plus, dans les phrases et dans les mélodies cette accentuation a une très grande importance pour la génération de la structure de surface. On peut penser que de tels parallèles entre le langage et la musique reflètent en fait des caractéristiques de la perception et de la cognition humaines.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectThe authors are indebted to Professor Ingmar Bengtsson, Uppsala University, and Professor Sten Malmström, Stockholm University for valuable discussions.

In this study, 298 undergraduates were instructed either to imagine an example of an innovative product or to imagine themselves creating a product in one of three domains (art, music, or gadgetry). Following the manipulation, participants rated the fitness of a list of creative traits relative to their first or third person creative exemplar. Fitness ratings were generally higher for third person exemplars than for first person exemplars. Though ratings also varied by domain, there was a significant interaction between perspective and domain, such that first-person ratings (i.e., self ratings) did not vary by exemplar domain, while third-person ratings (i.e., an external exemplar) did vary by domain. Implications and future directions for the study of implicit theories and creative performance and achievement are discussed.Implicit theories of creativity are differentially categorized by perspective and exemplar domain - ScienceDirectRichard W. Hass is now affiliated with Philadelphia University.The place of cognition in explanations of teaching: A dialog of interpretive and cognitive approaches - ScienceDirectThis debate contrasts interpretive and cognitive approaches to explaining teachers' thoughts and actions, exploring epistemological and ontological assumptions that broadly underlie research on teaching. Fundamental to the discussion is whether cognition should be construed as individual mental processing of privately held information structures or as a social event in which thinking is situated, shared, intersubjective, and practical. Also addressed is whether an effective explanation of teaching can rest mainly on an account of a teacher's cognition or whether it must attend equally to an examination of the place in which the teaching occurs and, if the latter, how place exerts its influence.The place of cognition in explanations of teaching: A dialog of interpretive and cognitive approaches - ScienceDirectThis paper is based upon a discussion (session 49.41) that took place at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Atlanta, 1993. The authors wish to thank and acknowledge the contributions of John Mergendoller, who arranged that invited symposium, and of Jere Brophy and Lyn Corno, who were the discussants.Simulating the effects of dopamine imbalance on cognition: From positive affect to Parkinson’s disease - ScienceDirectCools (2006) suggested that prefrontal dopamine levels are related to cognitive stability whereas striatal dopamine levels are related to cognitive plasticity. With such a wide ranging role, almost all cognitive activities should be affected by dopamine levels in the brain. Not surprisingly, factors influencing brain dopamine levels have been shown to improve/worsen performance in many behavioral experiments. On the one hand, Nadler, Rabi, and Minda (2010) showed that positive affect (which is thought to increase cortical dopamine levels) improves a type of categorization that depends on explicit reasoning (rule-based) but not another type that depends on procedural learning (information-integration). On the other hand, Parkinson’s disease (which is known to decrease dopamine levels in both the striatum and cortex) produces proactive interference in the odd-man-out task (Flowers & Robertson, 1985) and renders subjects insensitive to negative feedback during reversal learning (Cools, Altamirano, & D’Esposito, 2006). This article uses the COVIS model of categorization to simulate the effects of different dopamine levels in categorization, reversal learning, and the odd-man-out task. The results show a good match between the simulated and human data, which suggests that the role of dopamine in COVIS can account for several cognitive enhancements and deficits related to dopamine levels in healthy and patient populations.Efecto ansiolítico de la musicoterapia: aspectos neurobiológicos y cognoscitivos del procesamiento musical - ScienceDirectLa música está presente en todas las culturas y nos acompaña desde los albores de la historia de la humanidad. Desde tiempos ancestrales se le ha atribuido un efecto relajante y curativo, que es evidente en los rituales de sanación mediante cantos, danzas e interpretación de instrumentos.

La activación de memorias asociativas y el análisis de la expresión emocional, ligados a la percepción tonal y temporal del módulo de procesamiento musical, son los principales componentes cognoscitivos involucrados en el efecto relajante mediado por la música. La exposición musical desencadena mecanismos neuroprotectores, al promover la expresión de neurotrofinas.

The activation of associative memories and the analysis of emotional expression, linked to the tonal and temporal perception of the musical processing module, are the main cognitive components involved in the relaxant effect mediated by music. Music exposure also acts as a neuroprotective agent by promoting the expression of neurotrophins. Music is therefore an excellent and affordable therapeutic tool, easy to use, accessible, and without side effects, which can be used as a coadjuvant in the treatment of several nosological entities.Efecto ansiolítico de la musicoterapia: aspectos neurobiológicos y cognoscitivos del procesamiento musical - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Efecto ansiolítico de la musicoterapia: aspectos neurobiológicos y cognoscitivos del procesamiento musical - ScienceDirectConflictos de interés: El autor manifiesta que no tiene conflictos de interés en este artículo.Preoperative Screening - ScienceDirectDisclosure Statement: Dr M.T.

Abstraction is universal, but rationalization first appeared in ancient Greece, theorization in Renaissance Italy, and model building in twentieth-century Europe. These four processes employ the methods of metaphor, metalingual definition, algorithm, and control, respectively. The intellectual and practical achievements of populations guided by these several processes and exploiting their different mechanisms differ so greatly as to warrant separation into cultural ranks. The fourth rank is not completely formed, while regions of the world and parts of every population continue to operate by the processes of earlier ranks.The evolution of cognition - ScienceDirectWilliam L.

The present study used an eye tracker to investigate audience members’ gazes while appreciating an audiovisual musical ensemble performance, based on evidence of the dominance of musical part in auditory attention when listening to multipart music that contains different melody lines and the joint-attention theory of gaze. We presented singing performances, by a female duo. The main findings were as follows: (1) the melody part (soprano) attracted more visual attention than the accompaniment part (alto) throughout the piece, (2) joint attention emerged when the singers shifted their gazes toward their co-performer, suggesting that inter-performer gazing interactions that play a spotlight role mediated performer-audience visual interaction, and (3) musical part (melody or accompaniment) strongly influenced the total duration of gazes among audiences, while the spotlight effect of gaze was limited to just after the singers’ gaze shifts.The power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectThe power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectMental simulation and mental imagery evoked by ad visuals enhance ad effectiveness.The power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectMulti-sensory stimulation in ad copy enhances actual taste perceptions.The power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectTouch, actual or imagined, increases consumer product evaluations.The power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectSmell enhances memory for product descriptions and affects product evaluations.The power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectMusic in advertising affects attention and increases ad persuasiveness.The power of sensory marketing in advertising - ScienceDirectThis article discusses the role of sensory marketing in driving advertisement effectiveness.

Previous studies showed that symbolic inducers (e.g., numbers, months) can modulate response according to the inducer’s relative position on the synesthetic spatial form. In the current study we tested two musical–space synesthetes and a group of matched controls on three different tasks: musical–space mapping, spatial cue detection and a spatial Stroop-like task. In the free mapping task, both synesthetes exhibited a diagonal organization of musical pitch tones rising from bottom left to the top right. This organization was found to be consistent over time. In the subsequent tasks, synesthetes were asked to ignore an auditory or visually presented musical pitch (irrelevant information) and respond to a visual target (i.e., an asterisk) on the screen (relevant information). Compatibility between musical pitch and the target’s spatial location was manipulated to be compatible or incompatible with the synesthetes’ spatial representations. In the spatial cue detection task participants had to press the space key immediately upon detecting the target. In the Stroop-like task, they had to reach the target by using a mouse cursor. In both tasks, synesthetes’ performance was modulated by the compatibility between irrelevant and relevant spatial information. Specifically, the target’s spatial location conflicted with the spatial information triggered by the irrelevant musical stimulus. These results reveal that for musical–space synesthetes, musical information automatically orients attention according to their specific spatial musical-forms. The present study demonstrates the genuineness of musical–space synesthesia by revealing its two hallmarks—automaticity and consistency. In addition, our results challenge previous findings regarding an implicit vertical representation for pitch tones in non-synesthete musicians.Musical space synesthesia: Automatic, explicit and conceptual connections between musical stimuli and space - ScienceDirectTheses authors contributed equally to this work.The experience of agency in sequence production with altered auditory feedback - ScienceDirectWhen speaking or producing music, people rely in part on auditory feedback – the sounds associated with the performed action. Three experiments investigated the degree to which alterations of auditory feedback (AAF) during music performances influence the experience of agency (i.e., the sense that your actions led to auditory events) and the possible link between agency and the disruptive effect of AAF on production. Participants performed short novel melodies from memory on a keyboard. Auditory feedback during performances was manipulated with respect to its pitch contents and/or its synchrony with actions. Participants rated their experience of agency after each trial. In all experiments, AAF reduced judgments of agency across conditions. Performance was most disrupted (measured by error rates and slowing) when AAF led to an ambiguous experience of agency, suggesting that there may be some causal relationship between agency and disruption. However, analyses revealed that these two effects were probably independent. A control experiment verified that performers can make veridical judgments of agency.The experience of agency in sequence production with altered auditory feedback - ScienceDirect► We examined the effect of altered auditory feedback on agency and disruption in a sequence-production task. ► Disruption of performance was associated with ambiguous feelings of agency. ► Manipulating inferences about the feedback source did not influence disruption. ► Both disruption and agency are probably independent effects of altered auditory feedback.The kinetic quality of store design: An Exploration of its influence on shopping experience - ScienceDirectKinetic quality of store space is the appreciation of the store with regard to the movements and gestures that can be performed during the shopping trip. Few researches have studied this concept despite its potential influence on shopping outcomes. In this paper, we show that the kinetic quality of the store has an impact on hedonic and utilitarian shopping values and on purchase. The impact on shopping value is similar in magnitude to that of atmospheric quality. Music and visual esthetics positively influence kinetic quality.The kinetic quality of store design: An Exploration of its influence on shopping experience - ScienceDirectTel.: +33 3 26 77 45 83, +33 6 19 02 18 32 (mob).Favorite Musical Styles, Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent’ Personality - ScienceDirectThis study aims to highlight the relationship between adolescents’ favourite musical styles, their level of emotional intelligence development and their personality traits. There were 97 teenagers involved, who individually note information on their favourite musical genres and the frequency of listening to their favourite music. Subjects were administered two tests as follows: the High School Personality Questionaire - HSPQ (Cattel) and the Emotional Intelligence Scale - EIS (Schutte et al., 1998). The results indicate that, according to adolescents’ preference for certain music styles, there are associations between their emotional intelligence and certain personality traits.Favorite Musical Styles, Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent’ Personality - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Committee of PSIWORLD 2014.Verbal and musical short-term memory: Variety of auditory disorders after stroke - ScienceDirectVerbal and musical short-term memory: Variety of auditory disorders after stroke - ScienceDirectStroke patients have auditory verbal and musical short-term memory deficits.Verbal and musical short-term memory: Variety of auditory disorders after stroke - ScienceDirectInferior fronto-parietal operculum is involved in auditory short-term memory.Verbal and musical short-term memory: Variety of auditory disorders after stroke - ScienceDirectCerebral networks for verbal and musical memory are to some extent distinct.Verbal and musical short-term memory: Variety of auditory disorders after stroke - ScienceDirectAuditory cognitive deficits after stroke may concern language and/or music processing, resulting in aphasia and/or amusia. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential deficits of auditory short-term memory for verbal and musical material after stroke and their underlying cerebral correlates with a Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping approach (VLSM). Patients with an ischemic stroke in the right (N = 10) or left (N = 10) middle cerebral artery territory and matched control participants (N = 14) were tested with a detailed neuropsychological assessment including global cognitive functions, music perception and language tasks. All participants then performed verbal and musical auditory short-term memory (STM) tasks that were implemented in the same way for both materials. Participants had to indicate whether series of four words or four tones presented in pairs, were the same or different. To detect domain-general STM deficits, they also had to perform a visual STM task. Behavioral results showed that patients had lower performance for the STM tasks in comparison with control participants, regardless of the material (words, tones, visual) and the lesion side. The individual patient data showed a double dissociation between some patients exhibiting verbal deficits without musical deficits or the reverse. Exploratory VLSM analyses suggested that dorsal pathways are involved in verbal (phonetic), musical (melodic), and visual STM, while the ventral auditory pathway is involved in musical STM.Electromagnetic recording of the auditory system - ScienceDirectAuditory processing is remarkably fast and sensitive to the precise temporal structure of acoustic signals over a range of scales, from submillisecond phenomena such as localization to the construction of elementary auditory attributes at tens of milliseconds to basic properties of speech and music at hundreds of milliseconds. In light of the rapid (and often transitory) nature of auditory phenomena, in order to investigate the neurocomputational basis of auditory perception and cognition, a technique with high temporal resolution is appropriate. Here we briefly outline the utility of magnetoencephalography (MEG) for the study of the neural basis of audition. The basics of MEG are outlined in brief, and some of the most-used neural responses are described. We discuss the classic transient evoked fields (e.g., M100), responses elicited by change in a stimulus (e.g., pitch-onset response), the auditory steady-state response, and neural oscillations (e.g., theta-phase tracking). Because of the high temporal resolution and the good spatial resolution of MEG, paired with the convenient location of human auditory cortex for MEG-based recording, electromagnetic recording of this type is well suited to investigate various aspects from audition, from crafted laboratory experiments on pitch perception or scene analysis to naturalistic speech and music tasks.Investigating the Relationship Between Musical Training and Mathematical Thinking in Children - ScienceDirectThis study examines the potential for music education to enhance children's mathematical thinking. Specification of potential cognitive correlates between musical and mathematical components is sought and underpins the design (3 variables x 2 conditions each = 6 groups). Nearly 200 children aged 7-8 years experienced weekly music lessons (duration = 9 months). Lessons emphasized melody, rhythm or form; in half of the classes, the teacher made the musical-mathematical parallels explicit.Investigating the Relationship Between Musical Training and Mathematical Thinking in Children - ScienceDirectApart from the specific musical-mathematical foci, the lesson content was kept as constant as possible within primary school settings. Pre-tests and post-tests in musical, creative, spatial and mathematical thinking were administered. Statistical analyses will examine improvement over time while considering differences among three musical components and two conditions for each.Investigating the Relationship Between Musical Training and Mathematical Thinking in Children - ScienceDirectThis research addresses concerns that governments’ quests for higher standards in mathematics may result in impoverished curricula with limited access to the arts. If it is shown that musical training appears to benefit logical thinking, as hypothesized, it may add to a growing body of research suggesting that policy-makers and educationalists reconsider curriculum balance.Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Exercise in Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease - ScienceDirectThe use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is growing worldwide. Well-performed, systematic evidence-based research is largely lacking in this area and many studies include various forms of CAM with small patient numbers and a lack of standardization of the approaches studied. Taichi, Qigong, dance, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and other CAM therapies are reviewed and there is some evidence for the following: Taichi in sleep and PDQ39; dance in cognition, apathy, and a mild trend to improved fatigue; yoga in PDQ39; and acupuncture in depression, PDQ39, and sleep.Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Exercise in Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease - ScienceDirectExercise including occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) has been studied in motor symptoms of PD and balance but only with small studies with a mounting evidence base for use of exercise in NMS of PD including PDQ39, sleep, fatigue, depression, and some subsets of cognition. Studies of OT and PT largely show some benefit to depression, apathy, and anxiety. Sustainability of an improvement has not been shown given short duration of follow up. Finding optimal control groups and blind for these interventions is also an issue. This is a very important area of study since patients want to be self-empowered and they want guidance on which form of exercise is the best. Additionally, evidence for PT and OT in NMS would give added weight to get these interventions covered through medical insurance.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectTurning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectAge-related decline in hearing abilities impacts speech understanding.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectMusical training enhances hearing ability for musical and non-musical tasks.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectOlder adults benefit from musical training in processing speech in noise.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectEngagement in musical activity offset age-related decline in cognitive skills.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectAge-related decline in hearing abilities is a ubiquitous part of aging, and commonly impacts speech understanding, especially when there are competing sound sources. While such age effects are partially due to changes within the cochlea, difficulties typically exist beyond measurable hearing loss, suggesting that central brain processes, as opposed to simple peripheral mechanisms (e.g., hearing sensitivity), play a critical role in governing hearing abilities late into life. Current training regimens aimed to improve central auditory processing abilities have experienced limited success in promoting listening benefits. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that in young adults, musical training positively modifies neural mechanisms, providing robust, long-lasting improvements to hearing abilities as well as to non-auditory tasks that engage cognitive control. These results offer the encouraging possibility that musical training might be used to counteract age-related changes in auditory cognition commonly observed in older adults. Here, we reviewed studies that have examined the effects of age and musical experience on auditory cognition with an emphasis on auditory scene analysis. We infer that musical training may offer potential benefits to complex listening and might be utilized as a means to delay or even attenuate declines in auditory perception and cognition that often emerge later in life.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Music: A window into the hearing brain>.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectHappy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectThe research explores task-related promotional DS content.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectThe LC4MP and resource matching theory serve as theoretical foundation.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectThe presence of DS diminishes negative emotions in utilitarian shopping contexts.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectAffective DS content evokes the most positive emotions and cognitions.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectDS can create positive shopping experiences in utilitarian shopping situations.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectRecent research has identified digital signage (DS) as a promising element for creating atmospheric value. However, extant studies have explored shoppers' reactions to DS showing advertising content in hedonic shopping environments. Considering the potential of utilitarian shopping situations to evoke negative emotions, the current research investigates whether DS positively affects consumers' responses in task-oriented shopping situations. In doing so, it incorporates assumptions from the limited capacity model and resource matching theory into a theoretical framework to explain how task-relevant DS content influences impulse purchases and store loyalty. This relationship is mediated by emotional and cognitive processes. By drawing on findings from prior studies, this research further differentiates the effects of cognitive, affective, and mixed DS content on consumer responses. A field experiment tests the theoretically derived responses. The findings suggest that affective DS content creates positive emotions and increases impulsive purchases and store loyalty.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectMarion Garaus, PhD, Marion Garaus is assistant professor in marketing at the Institute of Business Administration, University of Vienna, Austria.

Music can be used to assess a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, motor, and affective processes. We discuss how the study of musicality contributes to our understanding of each of these syndromes, drawing connections to the underling neurobiology when possible. After consideration of the methodological limitations of previous studies, we make suggestions for future areas of research within this field. Research into musicality in these developmental disorders can contribute to overarching questions about music, including domain general versus domain-specific mechanisms, development of musical interest and skill, and musical enculturation. Implications for understanding both typical and atypical development are discussed.Cross-modal influences of affect across social and non-social domains in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThe Williams syndrome (WS) cognitive profile is characterized by relative strengths in face processing, an attentional bias towards social stimuli, and an increased affinity and emotional reactivity to music. An audio-visual integration study examined the effects of auditory emotion on visual (social/non-social) affect identification in individuals with WS and typically developing (TD) and developmentally delayed (DD) controls. The social bias in WS was hypothesized to manifest as an increased ability to process social than non-social affect, and a reduced auditory influence in social contexts. The control groups were hypothesized to perform similarly across conditions. The results showed that while participants with WS exhibited indistinguishable performance to TD controls in identifying facial affect, DD controls performed significantly more poorly. The TD group outperformed the WS and DD groups in identifying non-social affect. The results suggest that emotionally evocative music facilitated the ability of participants with WS to process emotional facial expressions. These surprisingly strong facial-processing skills in individuals with WS may have been due to the effects of combining social and music stimuli and to a reduction in anxiety due to the music in particular. Several directions for future research are suggested.Cross-modal influences of affect across social and non-social domains in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectA.J.-P. and B.W.V. contributed equally to this work.The Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectThe Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectLSD-induced effects are blocked by the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserinThe Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectLSD increased the attribution of meaning to previously meaningless musicThe Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectSimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor is crucial for the generation of meaningThe Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectChanges in personal meaning attribution are mediated by cortical midline structuresThe Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectA core aspect of the human self is the attribution of personal relevance to everyday stimuli enabling us to experience our environment as meaningful [1]. However, abnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to sensory experiences are also critical features of many psychiatric disorders [2, 3]. Despite their clinical relevance, the neurochemical and anatomical substrates enabling meaningful experiences are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the neuropharmacology of personal relevance processing in humans by combining fMRI and the administration of the mixed serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptor (R) agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), well known to alter the subjective meaning of percepts, with and without pretreatment with the 5-HT2AR antagonist ketanserin. General subjective LSD effects were fully blocked by ketanserin. In addition, ketanserin inhibited the LSD-induced attribution of personal relevance to previously meaningless stimuli and modulated the processing of meaningful stimuli in cortical midline structures. These findings point to the crucial role of the 5-HT2AR subtype and cortical midline regions in the generation and attribution of personal relevance. Our results thus increase our mechanistic understanding of personal relevance processing and reveal potential targets for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in personal relevance attribution.The Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation - ScienceDirectLead ContactAlignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectAlignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectA new approach to social cognition in terms of mental alignment is proposed.Alignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectThe dynamic and graded exchange of information between agents creates alignment.Alignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectNot all forms of joint action in which the agents align will turn out to be social interactions.Alignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectShared goals are not needed for mutual alignment to occur.Alignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectTwo important theoretical developments follow from focusing on processes of mental alignment.Alignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectAccording to the prevailing paradigm in social-cognitive neuroscience, the mental states of individuals become shared when they adapt to each other in the pursuit of a shared goal. We challenge this view by proposing an alternative approach to the cognitive foundations of social interactions. The central claim of this paper is that social cognition concerns the graded and dynamic process of alignment of individual minds, even in the absence of a shared goal. When individuals reciprocally exchange information about each other's minds processes of alignment unfold over time and across space, creating a social interaction. Not all cases of joint action involve such reciprocal exchange of information. To understand the nature of social interactions, then, we propose that attention should be focused on the manner in which people align words and thoughts, bodily postures and movements, in order to take one another into account and to make full use of socially relevant information.Effects of relaxing music on agitation during meals among nursing home residents with severe cognitive impairment - ScienceDirectRelaxing music was hypothesized to buffer the general nolse level typically found in dining rooms of nursing homes, exert a calming effect, and thus reduce agitated behaviors among residents with severe cognitive impairment. Twenty-nine nursing home residents with severe cognitive deficits participated in a 4-week protocol in which, following baseline observations (week 1), relaxing music was introduced (week 2), removed (week 3), and reintroduced (week 4). Subjects were observed in terms of total number of behaviors of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory present during a given week, and the number of behaviors present on the subscales of aggressive, physically nonaggressive, verbally agitated, and hiding/hoarding behaviors. Significant reductions were observed on the cumulative incidence of total agitated behaviors (63.4%); as well as the cumulative incidence of physically nonaggressive behaviors (56.3%) and verbally agitated behaviors (74.5%). No significant reductions were noted in terms of aggressive behaviors and hiding/hoarding behaviors. Where significant reductions were achieved, a distinct pattern was observed. Agitation decreased during week 2, increased again during week 3, only to decrease again in week 4. In addition, variance effects were noted as well, as ranges and standard deviations of agitated behaviors narrowed over time. These findings are interpreted within Hall and Buckwalter's (1988) model of a progressively lowered stress threshold among dementia patients.Effects of relaxing music on agitation during meals among nursing home residents with severe cognitive impairment - ScienceDirectThis article was supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.Effects of alcohol consumption and alcohol susceptibility on cognition: a psychophysiological examination - ScienceDirectThe present study sought to examine acute effects of alcohol on cognitive processing and performance within the context of two prominent theories of alcohol's effects; namely, that alcohol restricts the focus of attention (e.g. Steele and Josephs, 1990. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 97, 196–205) and that alcohol impairs response inhibition (e.g. Fillmore and Vogel-Sprott, 1999. Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, 7, 49–55; Fillmore and Vogel-Sprott, 2000. Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 61, 239–246). Forty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo level of alcohol (0.04 g/kg), a moderate dose (0.40 g/kg), or a higher dose (0.80 g/kg). Brain electrical activity (ERPs) and behavioral responses (reaction time and accuracy) were measured while participants performed a modified flanker task, in which a target letter was flanked by response-compatible or response-incompatible letters. Analyses of behavioral data showed that alcohol increased response competition in accuracy but not response times, suggesting that alcohol influences response selection more than attentional processes per se. This finding is in-line with predictions derived from the response inhibition model. ERP latency data provided mixed support for both models. ERP amplitude data showed that the high dose of alcohol primarily influenced a mostly frontal negativity in the ERP, present on both correct and incorrect response trials. Differences in self-reported susceptibility to alcohol were most evident in the amplitude of the P3 component. Findings are discussed in terms of the differential effects of acute dose and susceptibility on information processing.Arts therapies for young offenders in secure care—A practice-based research - ScienceDirectThis article describes the results of the first phase of a research project to develop, implement, evaluate, and improve arts therapies interventions for young offenders in secure care. By means of a naturalistic/constructivistic research methodology in combination with grounded therapy methodology, practice-based evidence has been generated. Core problems of young offenders that are connected to delinquency have been described and arts therapies interventions have been developed that can be used to change these core problems. Core problems are problems with self-image, with expressing and discharging emotions, the inability to resolve interpersonal problems and finally, negative cognitions. In co-creation with practitioners, interventions have been developed for drama therapy, music therapy, art therapy and dance-movement therapy. A treatment theory has been developed that explains the working of arts therapies by means of the first author's theory of analogy. This theory explains arts therapies by means of the equality between forms of expression in art and the core self consciousness as described by Damasio and the vitality affects within the core self as described by Stern.Arts therapies for young offenders in secure care—A practice-based research - ScienceDirect▶ Best practices for all arts therapies working with juvenile offenders in the area of disturbed self-image, emotions, interaction and cognition. ▶ Best practices that can be used in regular practice. ▶ Best practices that are based on tacit knowledge, practice based evidence and evidence based practice. ▶ One valuable aspect of this study is that it has led to arts therapists from various different institutions and with different backgrounds talking to one another and developing their work. Because so much knowledge taken from practice, theory, and research is integrated by the professionals themselves, there is strong commitment to actual application of the interventions. It is also important that independent experts are involved in discussion of the usefulness and the effect of arts therapies. Arts therapists and experts with a variety of theoretical perspectives exchange views and assist one another in developing the intervention and accounting for its effect.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectA systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectMuch research has examined biomarkers of chronic stress in dementia caregivers.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectCortisol was increased in dementia caregivers in most studies examining cortisol.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectDementia caregivers displayed poorer attention and executive function performance.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectInterventions to reduce stress in caregivers may improve cognition.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectRisk of bias was generally low to moderate.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectAs the physiological impact of chronic stress is difficult to study in humans, naturalistic stressors are invaluable sources of information in this area. This review systematically evaluates the research literature examining biomarkers of chronic stress, including neurocognition, in informal dementia caregivers.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectWe identified 151 papers for inclusion in the final review, including papers examining differences between caregivers and controls as well as interventions aimed at counteracting the biological burden of chronic caregiving stress.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectResults indicate that cortisol was increased in caregivers in a majority of studies examining this biomarker. There was mixed evidence for differences in epinephrine, norepinephrine and other cardiovascular markers. There was a high level of heterogeneity in immune system measures. Caregivers performed more poorly on attention and executive functioning tests. There was mixed evidence for memory performance. Interventions to reduce stress improved cognition but had mixed effects on cortisol. Risk of bias was generally low to moderate. Given the rising need for family caregivers worldwide, the implications of these findings can no longer be neglected.A systematic review of the psychobiological burden of informal caregiving for patients with dementia: Focus on cognitive and biological markers of chronic stress - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (124KB)Download full-size imageMusicoterapia en la enfermedad de Alzheimer: efectos cognitivos, psicológicos y conductuales - ScienceDirectLa musicoterapia forma parte de los programas de envejecimiento activo que se ofrecen a las personas mayores.

Increasingly, the theories, findings, and methods of what is known as the information processing approach are being used in attempts to explain intelligence related phenomena. This article examines intelligence from a different perspective, which emphasizes domain-specific constraints on knowledge structures. It is argued that conceptions of what intelligence is and how it relates to the rest of cognition can vary considerably when viewed from the vantage points of these two perspectives. The constraints approach views intelligence as being closely related to a special subset of all of our cognitive abilities and as having unique distinguishing properties. It is also argued that the evaluation of any cognitive ability as being intelligent depends crucially on a prior specification of the formal constraints on the domain or domains of knowledge from which that ability originates.Intelligence and the rest of cognition - ScienceDirectPreparation of this paper and some of the research reported herein was supported by NSF grants BNS-78-06200 and BNS-81-02655 to the author.

The present study examined the effect of Quran tune on students’ memory. The study method was experimental with pre-test, post-test and control group. School was selected conveniently, but the subjects randomly among girls, grade 5. In order to evaluate the memory of subjects, Wechsler's digit span and alphabet succession tests (version 4) were applied. First we gave both tests to students, and then we Quran tune was played to them for 15 minutes using headphones, finally the two tests were applied once more. This procedure was done in control group with the exception that no tune was played during 15 minutes. The control subjects were monitored not to do any effective or intervening activity to influence memory. Data were analyzed using t-Test. The research findings indicated that Quran group was significantly different from control group in terms of digit span (p<0.001) as well as alphabet succession (p<0.001).Effectiveness of Quran Tune on Memory in children - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.The neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectThe neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectMRI research on instrumental and vocal improvisation is synthesized.The neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectImprovisation is most commonly related to premotor cortex activation.The neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectDefault and executive network hubs also show differential involvement.The neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectCooperation between large-scale networks may underlie creative behavior.The neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectResearchers have recently begun to examine the neural basis of musical improvisation, one of the most complex forms of creative behavior. The emerging field of improvisation neuroscience has implications not only for the study of artistic expertise, but also for understanding the neural underpinnings of domain-general processes such as motor control and language production. This review synthesizes functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) studies of musical improvisation, including vocal and instrumental improvisation, with samples of jazz pianists, classical musicians, freestyle rap artists, and non-musicians. A network of prefrontal brain regions commonly linked to improvisatory behavior is highlighted, including the pre-supplementary motor area, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal premotor cortex. Activation of premotor and lateral prefrontal regions suggests that a seemingly unconstrained behavior may actually benefit from motor planning and cognitive control. Yet activation of cortical midline regions points to a role of spontaneous cognition characteristic of the default network. Together, such results may reflect cooperation between large-scale brain networks associated with cognitive control and spontaneous thought. The improvisation literature is integrated with Pressing's theoretical model, and discussed within the broader context of research on the brain basis of creative cognition.Jazz musicians reveal role of expectancy in human creativity - ScienceDirectJazz musicians reveal role of expectancy in human creativity - ScienceDirectJazz musicians prefer unexpected chord progressions.Jazz musicians reveal role of expectancy in human creativity - ScienceDirectClassical and Jazz musicians show different brain responses to unexpected events.Jazz musicians reveal role of expectancy in human creativity - ScienceDirectEvent Related Potentials to unexpected events correlate with creative behavior.Jazz musicians reveal role of expectancy in human creativity - ScienceDirectCreativity has been defined as the ability to produce work that is novel, high in quality, and appropriate to an audience. While the nature of the creative process is under debate, many believe that creativity relies on real-time combinations of known neural and cognitive processes. One useful model of creativity comes from musical improvisation, such as in jazz, in which musicians spontaneously create novel sound sequences. Here we use jazz musicians to test the hypothesis that individuals with training in musical improvisation, which entails creative generation of musical ideas, might process expectancy differently. We compare jazz improvisers, non-improvising musicians, and non-musicians in the domain-general task of divergent thinking, as well as the musical task of preference ratings for chord progressions that vary in expectation while EEGs were recorded. Behavioral results showed for the first time that jazz musicians preferred unexpected chord progressions. ERP results showed that unexpected stimuli elicited larger early and mid-latency ERP responses (ERAN and P3b), followed by smaller long-latency responses (Late Positivity Potential) in jazz musicians. The amplitudes of these ERP components were significantly correlated with behavioral measures of fluency and originality on the divergent thinking task. Together, results highlight the role of expectancy in creativity.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectExposure to music may be useful in the P300 retest and avoid habituation.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectTo verify the influence of the exposure to different kinds of music in P300 in young females.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectClinical prospective.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectForty-five women aged from 20 to 36 years were evaluated.

It surveys the historical roots of interest in social episodes in psychology and sociology and reviews recent research on situations and episodes in personality, social, cognitive, and clinical psychology. The chapter focuses on the two currently dominant approaches to episode cognition: the sociocultural strategy based on modeling consensual episode spaces and the information processing strategy to study the cognitive and affective factors in episode cognition. In the social consensus approach, research on situation perception; studies of episode domains—subcultural, group, and individual differences in episode cognition; and elements in episode cognition are discussed in the chapter. The practical implications of this work and the prospects of episode research in social psychology are discussed in the chapter.Episode Cognition: Internal Representations of Interaction Routines - ScienceDirectFinancial support for many of the studies reported here was provided by the Australian Research Grants CommissionMusic therapy research 1: A review of the medical research literature within a general context of music therapy research - ScienceDirectDavid Aldridge, a frequent contributor, is a research consultant to the medical faculty of Universität Witten Herdecke, Germany, and European EdiThe perception of musical phrase structure: A cross-cultural ERP study - ScienceDirectElectroencephalography (EEG) was used in a cross-cultural music study investigating phrase boundary perception. Chinese and German musicians performed a cultural categorization task under Chinese and Western music listening conditions. Western music was the major subject for both groups of musicians, while Chinese music was familiar to Chinese subjects only. By manipulating the presence of pauses between two phrases in the biphrasal melodies, EEG correlates for the perception of phrase boundaries were found in both groups under both music listening conditions. Between 450 and 600 ms, the music CPS (closure positive shift), which had been found in earlier studies with a false tone detection task, was replicated for the more global categorization task and for all combinations of subject group and musical style. At short latencies (100 and 450 ms post phrase boundary offset), EEG correlates varied as a function of musical styles and subject group. Both bottom–up (style properties of the music) and top–down (acculturation of the subjects) information interacted during this early processing stage.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectDon’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectNew fMRI paradigm to investigate the influence of mood induction on self-evaluation.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectAscribing positive traits to oneself was unaffected by mood.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectAscription of negative characteristics was decreased by negative mood induction.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectHigher self-worth leads to a more positive self-evaluation under sad mood induction.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectSelf-worth is related to STG activation during self-evaluation in sad vs. neutral mood.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectSelf-evaluation affects one's own mental state, social interactions and everyday life. Mood, in turn, has an impact on self-evaluation. However, the influence of mood on self-evaluation at the neural level has barely been examined. In this fMRI study, the interaction of mood and self-perception was investigated in 20 healthy participants. Happy, sad and neutral music was presented while participants were instructed to immerse themselves in the mood of the music and to rate how well presented traits characterized themselves. In a lexical control condition, subjects had to count a specific letter in the word. Behavioral data reflected successful mood induction. While self-ascription of positive traits was unaffected by mood, self-ascription of negative characteristics was decreased by negative affect. A positive correlation was found between self-worth scores and the difference in the amount of self-ascribed positive versus negative traits during negative mood induction. At the neural level, amygdalo-hippocampal, superior and middle temporal structures were differently involved in self-evaluation (vs. lexical processing) depending on the mood. While activation of the amygdalo-hippocampal complex was found during sad in comparison to both happy and neutral mood, superior/middle temporal gyrus (STG/MTG) activation was only found when contrasting sad vs. neutral mood. Further, a correlation analysis with self-worth ratings revealed a positive relation to STG activation during self-ascription of trait adjectives in sad compared to neutral mood. Our results underscore the importance of the current emotional state for self-evaluation and identify some neural correlates of this effect. Our findings in healthy research participants suggest a compensatory mechanism during sad mood induction to maintain a positive self-image, which is supported by activation of limbic and fronto-temporal cortex. Studies in clinically depressed populations could reveal whether this compensatory mechanism is aberrant.Don’t worry, be happy - Neural correlates of the influence of musically induced mood on self-evaluation - ScienceDirectPresent Address: Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, 50923 Cologne, Germany.Two epistemologies: Music therapy and medicine in the treatment of dementia - ScienceDirectDavid Aldridge, a frequent contributor, is a research consultant to the medical faculty of Universität Witten Herdecke, Germany and European EditTwo epistemologies: Music therapy and medicine in the treatment of dementia - ScienceDirectGudrun Aldridge is a music therapist.Explaining the ineffable - ScienceDirectThe 10th Anniversary Conference of the European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music was held at Liège, Belgium, on 5–8 April 2002.Body Percussion and Voice, Time and Pitch: An Exercise in “Singing BAPNE®” Methodologically Analyzed - ScienceDirectIn this paper we examine one exercise taken by the Singing BAPNE music education program, in order to find involvement in time and pitch perception. Musical tempo is marked with the presence of strong and weak accents alternately; this alternation, caused by loop patterns in the exercise, has influence in the expectations about upcoming events. Moreover, pitch is anchored to rhythmic setting on the beat and off the beat. Our objective is to structure the connection between body movement and the use of the voice in the exercise. This analysis highlights how loops combinations of body percussion and singed patterns, systematized through the BAPNE Method, are didactically involved in perception of time and in pitch-time relation skills of the students.Body Percussion and Voice, Time and Pitch: An Exercise in “Singing BAPNE®” Methodologically Analyzed - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of EDUHEM 2016.Congenital amusia - ScienceDirectFor most people, music, like language, is acquired effortlessly in early life. But a few percent of the population have lifelong difficulties in the perception and production of music. In this chapter we discuss psycho-acoustic and behavioral studies that have attempted to delineate the nature of the auditory perceptual deficits in this group and consider whether these difficulties extend outside the musical domain. Finally, we review structural imaging studies in this group which point to subtle anomalies in temporal and frontal areas. We suggest that amusia can be considered a disorder of neural development, which has relatively specific consequences at the behavioral level. Studies of congenital amusia provide a unique window on the neurocognitive architecture of music processing.Animal Cognition: Multimodal Tactics of Orangutan Communication - ScienceDirectOrangutans select different tactics for repairing failed communication, depending upon how well they are understood: they repeat signals if they are partially understood and switch tactics entirely if completely misunderstood.Experimental Evidence for Synchronization to a Musical Beat in a Nonhuman Animal - ScienceDirectThe tendency to move in rhythmic synchrony with a musical beat (e.g., via head bobbing, foot tapping, or dance) is a human universal [1] yet is not commonly observed in other species [2]. Does this ability reflect a brain specialization for music cognition, or does it build on neural circuitry that ordinarily serves other functions? According to the “vocal learning and rhythmic synchronization” hypothesis [3], entrainment to a musical beat relies on the neural circuitry for complex vocal learning, an ability that requires a tight link between auditory and motor circuits in the brain [4, 5]. This hypothesis predicts that only vocal learning species (such as humans and some birds, cetaceans, and pinnipeds, but not nonhuman primates) are capable of synchronizing movements to a musical beat. Here we report experimental evidence for synchronization to a beat in a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita eleonora). By manipulating the tempo of a musical excerpt across a wide range, we show that the animal spontaneously adjusts the tempo of its rhythmic movements to stay synchronized with the beat. These findings indicate that synchronization to a musical beat is not uniquely human and suggest that animal models can provide insights into the neurobiology and evolution of human music [6].Spatial Agency Bias: Representing People in Space - ScienceDirectIn this chapter, we argue that the way we read and write exerts a pervasive, subtle, and generally unacknowledged influence on social cognition. We propose a theoretical model, the Spatial Agency Bias (SAB), according to which human agency is envisaged following the script direction that is prevalent in a given cultural context (for instance, left to right in English and right to left in Arabic or Hebrew). This bias is the joint function of two interrelated asymmetries, one deriving from script direction, the other from subject–object order. We report findings supporting the basic premises of the model and then discuss its pervasive role in intergroup relations and its practical applications in the areas of Website construction, advertisement, and, most importantly, stereotype change. We also address boundary conditions and moderators, with particular attention to construal level. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the SAB within the larger embodied cognition approach.Creativity and consciousness: Music therapy in intensive care - ScienceDirectDavid Aldridge is a research consultant to the medical faculty of Universität Witten Herdecke, Germany.

While previous neurophysiological research investigated cognitive and motor performance separately, findings that combine both are rare. To get a deeper understanding of the influence of motor demands as well as the difficulty of a simultaneously performed cognitive task, we investigated 20 healthy individuals. Participants performed two cognitive tasks with different levels of difficulty while sitting or standing on one leg. In addition to behavioral data, we recorded the electroencephalogram from 26Ag/AgCI scalp electrodes. The critical time-windows, predefined by visual inspection, yielded an early (200–300 ms, P2) and a subsequent positivity (350–500 ms, P3). Statistical analysis of the early time window registered a motor × cognition interaction. Resolution of this interaction revealed an effect of the cognitive task in the one-legged stance motor condition, with a more pronounced positivity for the difficult task. No significant differences between cognitive tasks emerged for the simple motor condition. The time-window between 350 and 500 ms registered main effects of the motor task and a trend for the cognitive task. While the influence of cognitive task difficulty (in the P3) is in accordance with previous studies, the motor task effect is specific to one-legged stance (cf. no effects for running in previous research). The motor-cognition interaction found in the P2 indicates that the more difficult motor task (one-legged stance) facilitates cognitive task performance.Chapter 21 Hypertext and reading cognition - ScienceDirect“Hypertext”—a term which is sometimes extended to include hypermedia in general—refers to software capabilities that allow readers supposedly non-linear forms of access to information via personal computers and terminals. A typical hypertext document would open with a top-level menu or home page which might include conventional texts, audio recordings, still pictures and/or video samples: indeed information of any kind which can be stored digitally. On selecting highlighted or colored words or phrases, or specially boxed graphic frames, a hypertext reader is led to a further screen containing more words and images that explain or expand the initially chosen item and so on, potentially indefinitely. Each verbal or graphic point can be thought of as a node in a grid of nodes, such that the path traversed in any particular session of reading will be open to the interests discovered by the reader as she or he passes through the grid. In principle, this form of information transfer should mean not only that hypertext information can flow freely to any reader whatsoever but also that, once accessed; any given document can be inspected according to the supposedly free choices of the reader. This double openness—of access to texts and of addressing their contents—has led some communications theorists to think of hypertext as revolutionary, as redistributing “power” away from text producers and toward readers. This chapter argues against such claims—principally (and perhaps ironically) because they are based on a very narrow conception of reading practices. If reading itself were (and always had been) such a narrowly-conceived social and cognitive practice, there might be some substance to the celebratory and optimistic claims of these hypertext analysts. If not, their celebrations and their optimism may be premature.Creativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectCreativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectDetermine effect of positive and neutral mood on 8–9 year-olds creativity.Creativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectPositive mood produced by upbeat music and laughter.Creativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectRepeated-measures study: two trials each in the control and experimental conditions.Creativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectStudents practiced wordplay and then created cartoons.Creativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectExperimental condition cartoons had more humor, originality, and fluency of speech.Creativity of third graders’ leadership cartoons: Comparison of mood-enhanced to neutral conditions - ScienceDirectResearch on mood related to subsequent creativity is sparse for samples of children. The current study was conducted to determine the effects of positive mood induction through upbeat music and simulated laughter on creativity. Fourteen gifted third grade students (9 female, 5 male; 10 White, 3 African American, 1 Native American; aged 8–9 years) from a low-socio-economic urban public school in the Midwest participated in the repeated-measures study with two trials in the control and two trials in the experimental conditions. Each lesson began with wordplay work in making a layout of word cards, definition cards, and objects to show homophone or words with multiple meanings concepts. Students analyzed humorous cartoons related to leadership that the researchers had made. Finally, students used paper images and wrote in speech bubbles to create their own leadership cartoons. During the experimental condition, two mood-lifting activities were added: students listened to a couple of minutes of upbeat instrumental music as they gathered for the class and later, before cartoon production occurred, they participated in simulated laughter for thirty seconds. Results showed that cartoons produced during the experimental condition contained more humor, were more original, and had greater fluency of speech or thought bubbles with very large, large, and medium effect sizes respectively. Greater creativity is attributed to positive mood allowing more working memory for complex synthesis of ideas, recognition of more diverse ideas, and a safe environment for taking creative risks.Chapter 23 The musical brain - ScienceDirectThe available evidence suggests that there are a complex array of neural circuits underlying human music perception and creation. While early pathological correlations of ‘musical agnosia’ were noted in association with lesions in one or both anterior temporal lobes, more detailed musical networks are being increasingly investigated with structural and functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, psychoacoustics, and neuropsychological testing. The results offer exciting implications for the neuroscience of learning, memory, language, neurodevelopmen, and neurodegeneration. The focus of the following discussion is deficits in music perception, supplemented by a general discussion of neurological findings in musicians versus non-musicians. The human experience of music perception and performance certainly exceeds acoustical pattern extraction, analysis, and production. For many people, music is unique in its connection with both emotional perception and emotional experience. Continued theoretical modeling of musical perception and its functional neuroanatomic correlates will certainly propel the scientific study of music forward; yet, the therapeutic potential of music, reliant upon its intimate association with human emotion and cognition, also deserves further attention. Patients with Alzheimer's disease are able to demonstrate a normal familiarity preference pattern for novel tunes, suggesting a route to access implicit memory and improve quality of life, while children with dyslexia demonstrated improvement in spelling and phonics when engaged in classroom musical programs.Odours, emotions, and cognition – how odours may affect cognitive performance - ScienceDirectThis article reviews both theoretical and anatomical positions regarding the olfactory system and its links to emotion and cognitive performance.

However, these impairments have not been jointly interpreted under a unifying rationale or integratively assessed in terms of possible clinical implications. To bridge these gaps, here we introduce the “disrupted motor grounding hypothesis”, a new framework to conceive such impairments as disturbances of embodied mechanisms (high-order domains based on the recycling of functionally germane sensorimotor circuits). We focus on two relevant lesion models: Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. First, we describe the physiopathology of both conditions as models of progressive frontostriatal impairment. Then, we summarize works assessing action language, motor-language coupling, and syntax in samples at early and preclinical disease stages. To conclude, we discuss the implications of the evidence for neurolinguistic modeling, identify key issues to be addressed in future research, and discuss potential clinical implications. In brief, our work seeks to open new theoretical and translational avenues for embodied cognition research.217 pp. £24.95 Jules Davidoff, Cognition Through Colour: A Bradford Book, The MIT Press, New York, NY (1991), ISBN: 0 262 04115 4 - ScienceDirectByron Mikellides is Senior Lecturer in Environmental Psychology at the Oxford School of Architecture, Oxford Brookes University.Music, psychology and psychotherapy - ScienceDirectEdward A.

We contrasted differences in frontal upper alpha-band activity between tasks with high and low creativity demands by recording EEGs while skilled musicians listened to, played back, and improvised jazz melodies. Neural responses were compared for skilled musicians with training in musical improvisation versus those who had no formal improvisation training. Consistent with our hypotheses, individuals showed increased frontal upper alpha-band activity during more creative tasks (i.e., improvisation) compared to during less creative tasks (i.e., rote playback). Moreover, this effect was greatest for musicians with formal improvisation training. The strength of this effect also appeared to modulate the quality of these improvisations, as evidenced by significant correlations between upper alpha EEG power and objective post-hoc ratings of individuals’ performances. These findings support a conceptualization of creativity as a distinct mental state and suggest spontaneous processing capacity is better nurtured through formal institutional training than informal.A theory of 1/f noise in human cognition - ScienceDirectThe brain is probably the most interesting example of a complex network having 1/f variability as determined through the analysis of EEG time series and magnetoencephalogram recordings. Herein we develop a theory of 1/f noise of human cognition to explain the recent experimental observations that increasing the difficultly of cognitive tasks accelerates the transition from observed 1/f noise to white noise in decision-making time series.Insights from the animal kingdom - ScienceDirectJust as we have learned a great deal in consumer psychology by focusing on understanding how different sub-groups of humans think, this paper suggests that we can also learn from examining how different types of animals think. To that end, this manuscript offers a review of literature on topics in animal cognition that have also been investigated by consumer researchers. It first reviews research that has identified ways in which animals and humans are similar and then reviews research that has identified ways in which animals differ from humans, with a focus on ways in which some animals have been shown to outperform humans. The manuscript concludes with a discussion of opportunities for future research.Insights from the animal kingdom - ScienceDirectThe author gratefully acknowledges helpful comments from Amitav Chakravarti, Anna Greenleaf, Eric Greenleaf, Leo Greenleaf, Geeta Menon, Sankar Sen, and the JCP reviewers and Research Review Area Editor.

The purpose of this study was to develop a Rasch-based tool for Multidimensional Screening in Child Development (MuSiC) for children aged 0–3 years.A developmental screening tool for toddlers with multiple domains based on Rasch analysis - ScienceDirectThe MuSic was developed by constructing items bank based on three commonly used screening tools, validating with developmental status (at risk for delay or not) on five developmental domains. Parents of a convenient sample of 632 children (aged 3–35.5 months) with and without developmental delays responded to items from the three screening tools funded by health authorities in Taiwan. Item bank was determined by item fit of Rasch analysis for each of the five developmental domains (cognitive skills, language skills, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and socioadaptive skills). Children's performance scores in logits derived in Rasch analysis were validated with developmental status for each domain using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves.A developmental screening tool for toddlers with multiple domains based on Rasch analysis - ScienceDirectMuSiC, a 75-item developmental screening tool for five domains, was derived. The diagnostic validity of all five domains was acceptable for all stages of development, except for the infant stage (≤11 months and 15 days).A developmental screening tool for toddlers with multiple domains based on Rasch analysis - ScienceDirectMuSiC can be applied simultaneously to well-child care visits as a universal screening tool for children aged 1–3 years on multiple domains. Items with sound validity for infants need to be further developed.A developmental screening tool for toddlers with multiple domains based on Rasch analysis - ScienceDirectConflicts of interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to this article.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectEarly evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectLack of methods to earlier predict therapeutic effects in patients with epilepsy.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectEpileptiform discharges in patients were decreased when listening to Mozart K.448.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectWe developed a model for discriminating music's effectiveness by quantitative EEG.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectThe predicting model might apply to other therapies for an early prediction.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectThere are many treatments being developed for patients with epilepsy, including anti-epileptic drugs, ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation. To date, there is a lack of valid methods to predict at an early stage the therapeutic effects on patients with epilepsy who receive one of these treatments. Our previous studies revealed that epileptiform discharges which were observed in patients with epilepsy were significantly decreased while listening to Mozart K.448. In this study, we attempted to develop a useful marker by utilizing a quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) method in analyzing the features of EEG to early evaluate the effect of the music on children with epilepsy, even without epileptiform discharges.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectEEG segments from 19 Taiwanese children who were selected from a large screen study of music effect (eight boys and 11 girls) diagnosed with epilepsy were analyzed. EEG examinations were performed in two parallel periods in each patient; before, and while listening to Mozart K.448's first movement (8 min 22 s) and EEG data were compared by qEEG. EEG segments were classified into music effective/ineffective group. The term “effective” was defined as patient exposure to music resulting in over a 25% reduction in epileptiform discharges. On the contrary, the term “ineffective” was defined as patient exposure to music resulting in less than a 5% reduction in epileptiform discharges.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectThere were four global feature descriptors selected for the music effective/ineffective classification. Two descriptors, DecorrTime_avg_AVG and DecorrTime_std_AVG, were related to the EEG feature “decorrelation” whereas the other two descriptors, RelPowGamma_avg_SNR and RelPowGamma_std_SNR, were related to “relative power of gamma.” There were significantly higher RelPowGamma_std_SNR (0.190 ± 0.133 vs. −0.026 ± 0.119, p = 0.0029), DecorrTime_std_AVG (0.005 ± 0.004 vs. 0.0003 ± 0.0016, p = 0.0055), DecorrTime_avg_AVG (0.005 ± 0.005 vs. −0.002 ± 0.008, p = 0.0179), and RelPowGamma_avg_SNR (0.176 ± 0.219 vs. −0.078 ± 0.244, p = 0.0222) in the effective group than in the ineffective group. The precision rate of classification was 0.953.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectUsing qEEG, we have developed a useful model for predicting therapeutic effectiveness of music in patients with epilepsy. Among the limited number of patients, the tool is of potential to predict the effectiveness in patients even without epileptiform discharges. It is worthwhile in the application of other therapeutic model.Early evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness in children with epilepsy by quantitative EEG: A model of Mozart K.448 listening—a preliminary study - ScienceDirectCo-first authors.The role of cognitions, trait anxiety and disgust sensitivity in generating faintness around blood–injury phobic stimuli - ScienceDirectThe effects on blood–injury fear and fainting of scripts concerning pain, nausea, and anger and individual differences in trait anxiety and disgust sensitivity were investigated. Eighteen participants were high in disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety, 11 were low in disgust sensitivity but high in trait anxiety, 10 were high in disgust sensitivity but low in trait anxiety, and 16 were low in disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety. Participants were exposed to pain, nausea, and anger scripts during presentation of blood–injury slides. The ability of the scripts to increase symptoms of fear and faintness, on a state version of the Blood–Injection Symptom Scale (BISS; Page, A. C., Bennett, K. S., Carter, O., Smith, J., & Woodmore, K. (1997). Blood–Injection Symptom Scale (BISS): Assessing the structure of phobic symptomatology elicited by blood and injections. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 35, 457–464) were examined. Analyses indicated that individual differences in trait anxiety and disgust sensitivity interact to generate symptoms of faintness when the pain script was read. That is, disgust sensitive and trait anxious participants reported greater faintness relative to other conditions. The implications for theory and treatment of blood–injury–injection phobia are discussed.How to interpret the music of caressing: Target and source assignment in synaesthetic genitive constructions - ScienceDirectMetaphors have traditionally been defined as mappings between two conceptual domains, the target and the source. A fundamental question here is how people assign the target and source functions in a given metaphorical expression. The present paper proposes that there are two potential mechanisms, a linguistic one and a conceptual one that people might use to assign the target and source functions in a given metaphorical expression (e.g., “a green inspiration”). The linguistic mechanism is based on certain conventions which assign the target function to certain grammatical categories (e.g., the head noun of a metaphorical noun phrase), and the source function to others (e.g., the modifying adjective). The conceptual preference mechanism favors the assignment of the source function to accessible concepts and the target function to less accessible ones.How to interpret the music of caressing: Target and source assignment in synaesthetic genitive constructions - ScienceDirectSince there are clashing cases, namely, cases where the two mechanisms yield conflicting target/source assignments, the question of interest is which of these two mechanisms, the linguistic or the conceptual one is a better predictor of the way people assign the target and source functions in metaphorical expressions. The major goal of the present paper is to investigate this issue for a specific type of figure—the synaesthetic metaphor.How to interpret the music of caressing: Target and source assignment in synaesthetic genitive constructions - ScienceDirectThe paper begins by introducing a conceptual preference principle, according to which terms belonging to lower sensory modalities (e.g., touch and taste) are generally assigned the source function, while terms belonging to higher sensory modalities (e.g., vision and hearing) are generally assigned the target function. We then introduce a linguistic convention for assigning these functions to the linguistic constituents of the Hebrew noun–noun genitive construction. We report the findings of two interpretation generation experiments which support the hypothesis that the conceptual preference principle overrules the linguistic convention in people’s assignments of the target and source functions in the synaesthetic genitive construction. The implications of these findings are elaborated in the discussion.How to interpret the music of caressing: Target and source assignment in synaesthetic genitive constructions - ScienceDirectYeshayahu Shen is a professor in the Program of Cognitive Studies of Language and its Use, and in the Department of Literature at Tel Aviv University.

In this chapter, we start out by questioning this view and argue it needs to be replaced by a dynamic neuroconstructivist approach in which genes, brain, behavior, and environment interact multidirectionally throughout development. Using examples from the recent literature, we then highlight how a static modular view of the brain remains deeply ingrained in (1) behavioral, (2) neuroimaging, and (3) genetics research on typical and atypical cognitive development. Finally, we discuss future contributions of the neuroconstructivist approach to developmental research in particular, and cognitive neuroscience in general.Brain correlates of musical and facial emotion recognition: Evidence from the dementias - ScienceDirectThe recognition of facial expressions of emotion is impaired in semantic dementia (SD) and is associated with right-sided brain atrophy in areas known to be involved in emotion processing, notably the amygdala. Whether patients with SD also experience difficulty recognizing emotions conveyed by other media, such as music, is unclear. Prior studies have used excerpts of known music from classical or film repertoire but not unfamiliar melodies designed to convey distinct emotions. Patients with SD (n=11), Alzheimer's disease (n=12) and healthy control participants (n=20) underwent tests of emotion recognition in two modalities: unfamiliar musical tunes and unknown faces as well as volumetric MRI. Patients with SD were most impaired with the recognition of facial and musical emotions, particularly for negative emotions. Voxel-based morphometry showed that the labelling of emotions, regardless of modality, correlated with the degree of atrophy in the right temporal pole, amygdala and insula. The recognition of musical (but not facial) emotions was also associated with atrophy of the left anterior and inferior temporal lobe, which overlapped with regions correlating with standardized measures of verbal semantic memory. These findings highlight the common neural substrates supporting the processing of emotions by facial and musical stimuli but also indicate that the recognition of emotions from music draws upon brain regions that are associated with semantics in language.Brain correlates of musical and facial emotion recognition: Evidence from the dementias - ScienceDirect► Recognition of musical and facial emotions are impaired in SD. ► Recognition of musical and facial emotions correlates with the right amygdala and right temporal pole. ► Recognition of musical emotions overlaps with language-based areas in the brain.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectTrails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectGroups of participants built their understanding of concepts in LEGO bricks.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectThey were scanned with fMRI while they evaluated the products of their work.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectPhysical aspects of the models yielded neural activity in motor and fusiform regions.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectMeaning-related aspects yielded activity in social cognition-related areas and IFG.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectSelf-rated relatedness to fellow group members modulate activity in the insula.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectSymbolic artifacts present a challenge to theories of neurocognitive processing due to their hybrid nature: they are at the same time physical objects and vehicles of intangible social meanings. While their physical properties can be read of their perceptual appearance, the meaning of symbolic artifacts depends on the perceiver's interpretative attitude and embeddedness in cultural practices. In this study, participants built models of LEGO bricks to illustrate their understanding of abstract concepts. They were then scanned with fMRI while presented to photographs of their own and others' models. When participants attended to the meaning of the models in contrast to their bare physical properties, we observed activations in mPFC and TPJ, areas often associated with social cognition, and IFG, possibly related to semantics. When contrasting own and others' models, we also found activations in precuneus, an area associated with autobiographical memory and agency, while looking at one's own collective models yielded interaction effects in rostral ACC, right IFG and left Insula. Interestingly, variability in the insula was predicted by individual differences in participants' feeling of relatedness to their fellow group members during LEGO construction activity. Our findings support a view of symbolic artifacts as neuro-cognitive trails of human social interactions.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectSystematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectMicroneurosurgical performance is affected by extrinsic and intrinsic factors.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectA total of 48 studies were systematically reviewed and graded.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectWe present 18 recommendations on 8 factors affecting microsurgical performance.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectMicroneurosurgical techniques involve complex manual skills and hand–eye coordination that require substantial training. Many factors affect microneurosurgical skills. The goal of this study was to use a systematic evidence-based approach to analyze the quality of evidence for intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence microneurosurgical performance and to make weighted practical recommendations.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectA literature search of factors that may affect microsurgical performance was conducted using PubMed and Embase. The criteria for inclusion were established in accordance with the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) statement.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectForty-eight studies were included in the analysis. Most of the studies used surgeons as participants. Most used endoscopic surgery simulators to assess skills, and only 12 studies focused on microsurgery. This review provides 18 practical recommendations based on a systematic literature analysis of the following 8 domains: 1) listening to music before and during microsurgery, 2) caffeine consumption, 3) β-blocker use, 4) physical exercise, 5) sleep deprivation, 6) alcohol consumption before performing surgery, 7) duration of the operation, and 8) the ergonomic position of the surgeon.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectDespite the clear value of determining the effects of various factors on surgical performance, the available body of literature is limited, and it is not possible to determine standards for each surgical field. These recommendations may be used by neurosurgical trainees and practicing neurosurgeons to improve microsurgical performance and acquisition of microsurgical skills. Randomized studies assessing the factors that influence microsurgical performance are required.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectConflict of interest statement: This research was supported by funds from the Barrow Neurological Foundation, the Women's Board of the Barrow Neurological Institute, and the Newsome Chair in Neurosurgery Research M.C.P.Spatial representation of pitch height: the SMARC effect - ScienceDirectThrough the preferential pairing of response positions to pitch, here we show that the internal representation of pitch height is spatial in nature and affects performance, especially in musically trained participants, when response alternatives are either vertically or horizontally aligned. The finding that our cognitive system maps pitch height onto an internal representation of space, which in turn affects motor performance even when this perceptual attribute is irrelevant to the task, extends previous studies on auditory perception and suggests an interesting analogy between music perception and mathematical cognition. Both the basic elements of mathematical cognition (i.e. numbers) and the basic elements of musical cognition (i.e. pitches), appear to be mapped onto a mental spatial representation in a way that affects motor performance.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectAmbiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectMethod for examining action attribution in ambiguous conditions.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectSelf-to-other continuum: manipulating the proportion of tones generated by self versus other.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectMisattribution peaked in ambiguous conditions biased towards other.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectHallucination proneness increased misattribution in ambiguous conditions.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectMusical experience reduced misattribution in ambiguous conditions.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectIndividuals differ in their ability to attribute actions to self or other. This variance is thought to explain, in part, the experience of voice-hearing. Misattribution can also be context-driven. For example, causal ambiguity can arise when the actions of two or more individuals are coordinated and produce similar effects (e.g., music-making). Experience in such challenging contexts may refine skills of action attribution. Forty participants completed a novel finger-tapping task which parametrically manipulated the proportion of control that ‘self’ versus ‘other’ possessed over resulting auditory tones. Results showed that action misattribution peaked in the middle of the self-to-other continuum and was biased towards other. This pattern was related to both high hallucination-proneness and to low musical-experience. Findings suggest not only that causal ambiguity plays a key role in agency but also that action attribution abilities may improve with practice, potentially providing an avenue for remediation of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.Trends in rhythmics — language, literature and music - ScienceDirectThe aim of this paper is twofold. First of all I want to give a somewhat rough overview concerning generative theories recently developed in phonology, metrics, and musicology. Additionally, I want to sketch some inner relations between these theories as far as possible. Secondly, there are pointed out some problems and research questions involved with the above-mentioned theories concerning aspects of cognitive psychology.Trends in rhythmics — language, literature and music - ScienceDirectAuthor's address: A.

Cognitive processing of music is a useful tool for investigating human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Although general auditory processing and perception of musical sound are hampered in patients with MDD, whether the deficits in musical processing begin from pre-attentive stage is not well investigated yet. The present study aimed to investigate the MMN of musical sound in patients with MDD.Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectMMN responses to different musical features were compared in 20 patients with MDD and 20 age-matched healthy controls. The multi-feature paradigm was used to examine automatic change detection of six different musical sound features (pitch, timbre, location, intensity, slide, rhythm) in a complex musical context. Severity of depression and co-morbid anxiety were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA).Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectMMNs were obtained with all deviants. The timbre-MMN was significantly larger in MDD patients than in healthy controls, while the other deviants (pitch, location, intensity, slide and rhythm) elicited similar MMN across groups. For MDD patients, the amplitudes and latencies of MMNs did not correlate with severity of depression or co-morbid anxiety.Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectThe sample size in this study is relatively small.Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectPatients with MDD do not perform at the same level as controls in automatic change detection of timbre. This dysfunction is considered to be a trait-dependent feature of MDD.High-Level Cognition in Phobics: Abstract Anticipatory Memory Is Associated with the Attenuation of Physiological Reactivity to Threat - ScienceDirectThe extent to which anxious people benefit from exposure-based treatments seems to depend on the degree to which they activate their fear network during exposure. This study was designed to investigate whether the cognitive processing of threat in anxious individuals is dominated by abstract anticipatory memory, and whether this abstract memory mode is related to the incomplete activation of the fear network. Activation of the fear network was assessed during phobic exposure, as evidenced by the initial autonomic reaction. Spider phobics and controls were presented with a threatening imagery script. Half of them were exposed to a real-life spider. Spider phobics memorized relatively more abstract anticipatory descriptions than concrete sensory descriptions when compared with the control subjects. Only in phobic subjects, higher recognition of abstract anticipatory descriptions was inversely related to heart rate reactivity during exposure. A preferential memory mode for abstract information was related to an attenuated heart rate reactivity to threat in spider phobics. It is suggested that the preferential memory mode for abstract information may inhibit the activation of the subcortical affective memory system, which is crucial for the complete activation of the fear network. The absence of complete fear network activation may play a role in the persistence of anxiety disorders by hindering anxious individuals to learn that the stimuli they fear are not as dangerous as they assumed.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectA repeated listening procedure was designed to monitor changes in listener's appreciation of thematic categories in musical compositions. Subjects listened to a recorded musical composition. Passages selected from the composition were then played in pairs, and listeners rated their similarity. The similarity data were submitted to INDSCAL, a multidimensional scaling procedure, which located the passages in an n-dimensional space. This procedure was repeated in three separate sessions, so that changes in the perceived musical structure could be observed. In Study 1, subjects heard Liszt's Sonata in b, and target passages were Theme A, Theme B, and three variations of each theme. While extrathematic dimensions dominated early acquaintance, a theme dimension emerged in the second and third sessions. Musicians gave higher weight to the theme dimension than did nonmusicians, and theme was the only dimension for experts on this sonata. Musicians were also more accurate in a final classification test, but only after repeated listening. The effect of repeated exposure on transfer to new theme exemplars was considered in Study 2. It is hoped this work will foster more naturalistic approaches to musical cognition.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectThis paper is based on a dissertation presented to Princeton University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectThis research was supported, in part, by National Science Foundation Grant BNS 78-27943 to Princeton University, Sam Glucksberg, Principal Investigator, and was conducted while the author held a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectThe author's address is Educational Testing Service, Research Division, Room 115, Rosedale Road, Princeton, NJ 08541.Computational geometric aspects of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading - ScienceDirectMany problems concerning the theory and technology of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading are fundamentally geometric in nature. It is therefore not surprising that the field of computational geometry can contribute greatly to these problems. The interaction between computational geometry and music yields new insights into the theories of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading, as well as new problems for research in several areas, ranging from mathematics and computer science to music theory, music perception, and musicology. Recent results on the geometric and computational aspects of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading are reviewed, connections to established areas of computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational biology, and crystallography are pointed out, and new open problems are proposed.Computational geometric aspects of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading - ScienceDirectResearch supported by NSERC.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectThis study integrates extant research relating to store-related cognitions, customer emotions (arousal and pleasure), satisfaction, and loyalty into one framework. The researchers administer a survey to 274 customers in four coffee shops of a major chain. Using these data, the researchers test the hypotheses and model with structural equation modelling. The findings suggest that (a) store-related cognitions differentially affect emotions and customer outcomes (satisfaction and loyalty) and (b) the two emotions of arousal and pleasure differentially mediate the relationships between store-related cognitions and customer outcomes.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectTel.: + 49 261 287 2852; fax + 49 261 287 2851.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectTel.: + 44 141 548 4318; fax + 44 141 552 2802.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectTel.: + 44 131 451 3968.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectTel.: + 44 121 414 48318.Improving meal context in nursing homes.

Impact of four strategies on food intake and meal pleasure - ScienceDirectIn France, in most nursing homes, the composition of menus, the time and the place at which meals are served, the choice of one's place at the table are imposed on residents. Yet, the act of eating cannot be restricted to nutritional and sensory aspects alone. It also includes a psycho-affective dimension, which relates to the context in which the meal is served. We tested the impact of four contextual factors, considered individually, on food intake and meal pleasure in elderly people living in nursing homes: the way the main course was named on the menu, the size and the variety of portions of vegetables served to residents, the presence or not of condiments in the middle of the table and the presence or not of elements to modify the surroundings such as a decorative object on the table or background music. Twelve experimental meals were served to 42 nursing home residents. For each factor, we compared a control condition with two experimental conditions. Our study showed that changing a single contextual element of the meal in nursing homes could be sufficient to improve residents' satisfaction with their meals and increase the quantities of meat or vegetables consumed, as long as this factor had a direct impact on what was going to be consumed (increased variety on the plate, condiments on the table). Factors affecting the context of the meal (names of dishes, decor) proved to be ineffective. Given the budgetary constraints faced by nursing homes, this study proposes interesting and inexpensive ideas to increase satisfaction with meals and food intake in elderly people who are dependent on others for their meals.Improving meal context in nursing homes.

It is critical for geographically distributed designers to accurately perceive and comprehend other remote team members’ intentions and activities with a high level of awareness and presence as if they were working in the same room. More specifically, distributed cognition places emphasis on the social aspects of cognition and asserts that knowledge is distributed by placing memories, facts, or knowledge on objects, individuals, and tools in the environment they work. This paper proposes a new computer-mediated remote collaborative design system, TeleAR, to enhance the distributed cognition among remote designers by integrating Augmented Reality and telepresence technologies. This system can afford a high level externalization of shared resources, which includes gestures, design tools, design elements, and design materials. This paper further investigates how this system may affect designers’ communication and collaboration with focus on distributed cognition and mutual awareness. It also explores the critical communication-related issue addressed in the proposed system, including common ground and social capitals, perspective invariance, trust and spatial faithfulness.Mutual awareness in collaborative design: An Augmented Reality integrated telepresence system - ScienceDirectProf. Xiangyu Wang is holding Curtin-Woodside Chair Professor for Oil, Gas & LNG Construction and Project Management and the Co-Director of Australasian Joint Research Centre for Building Information Modelling (BIM).

The aim of this paper is to discuss a synthesis of 30 studies in the past 20 years on atmospheric effects towards human behaviours in the commercial environment. The synthesis includes variables used as environment stimuli that widely used in past studies and the effects. In summary, spatial layout, colour, scent, lighting and music are the most discussed variables in atmospheric studies and atmospheric stimuli affected human behaviours through emotion, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions.Review on Atmospheric Effects of Commercial Environment - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Association of Malaysian Environment-Behavior Researchers, AMER (ABRA malaysia).A computational framework for conceptual blending - ScienceDirectWe present a computational framework for conceptual blending, a concept invention method that is advocated in cognitive science as a fundamental and uniquely human engine for creative thinking. Our framework treats a crucial part of the blending process, namely the generalisation of input concepts, as a search problem that is solved by means of modern answer set programming methods to find commonalities among input concepts. We also address the problem of pruning the space of possible blends by introducing metrics that capture most of the so-called optimality principles, described in the cognitive science literature as guidelines to produce meaningful and serendipitous blends. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how our system invents novel concepts and theories in domains where creativity is crucial, namely mathematics and music.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectTrials in Alzheimer's disease are increasingly focusing on prevention in asymptomatic individuals. We hypothesized that indicators of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be present in the content of spoken language in older adults and be useful in distinguishing those with MCI from those who are cognitively intact. To test this hypothesis, we performed linguistic analyses of spoken words in participants with MCI and those with intact cognition participating in a clinical trial.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectData came from a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial to examine the effect of unstructured conversation on cognitive function among older adults with either normal cognition or MCI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01571427). Unstructured conversations (but with standardized preselected topics across subjects) were recorded between interviewers and interviewees during the intervention sessions of the trial from 14 MCI and 27 cognitively intact participants. From the transcription of interviewees recordings, we grouped spoken words using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a structured table of words, which categorizes 2500 words into 68 different word subcategories such as positive and negative words, fillers, and physical states. The number of words in each LIWC word subcategory constructed a vector of 68 dimensions representing the linguistic features of each subject. We used support vector machine and random forest classifiers to distinguish MCI from cognitively intact participants.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectMCI participants were distinguished from those with intact cognition using linguistic features obtained by LIWC with 84% classification accuracy which is well above chance 60%.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectLinguistic analyses of spoken language may be a powerful tool in distinguishing MCI subjects from those with intact cognition. Further studies to assess whether spoken language derived measures could detect changes in cognitive functions in clinical trials are warrented.Knowledge technology and the arts: A personal view - ScienceDirectIn this paper, I examine the effect of knowledge technology on the creative arts.

According to our analyses of frequency, mean list rank, and the Cognitive Salience Index, beautiful and suspenseful rank highest across all target categories. For plays/comedies, funny and sad turned out to be the most relevant terms; for novels and short stories, suspenseful, interesting and romantic; and for poetry romantic, along with the music-related terms harmonious, rhythmic, and melodious. A comparison of our results with analogous studies for visual aesthetics and music yielded a comprehensive map of the distribution of aesthetic appeal dimensions across sensory modalities and aesthetic domains, with poetry and music showing the greatest overlap.Mapping the aesthetic space of literature “from below” - ScienceDirectChristine A.

They are composed of two aspects: the analysis of raw rating and rater cognition. This study employed mixed methods research to examine the two aspects of rater effects in creativity assessment that relies on raters’ personal judgment. Quantitative data were collected from 2160 raw ratings made by 45 raters in three group and were analyzed by generalizability theory. Qualitative data were collected from raters’ explanation of rationales for rating and their answers for questions about rating process as well as from 12 in-depth interviews and both were analyzed by framing analysis. The results indicated that the dependability coefficients were low for all the three rater groups, which were further explained by the variations and inconsistencies in raters’ rating procedure, use of rating scales, and their beliefs about creativity.Rater effects in creativity assessment: A mixed methods investigation - ScienceDirectTel.: +1 305 348 3228.Dream production mechanisms and cognition - ScienceDirectDreaming requires the human mind to select elements of knowledge and to arrange them synchronously and sequentially. This paper outlines a model which contains several levels of cognitive mechanisms involved in dream production and illustrates how some of these mechanisms work. These processes are related to semantic network organization, memory retrieval, and the production of narratives. The conclusion deals with the comparison of cognitive processes involved in dream production and waking thought.The power of repetition: repetitive lyrics in a song increase processing fluency and drive market success - ScienceDirectThe majority of music people listen to in their daily lives includes lyrics. This research documents how more repetitive songs lyrically are processed more fluently and thus adopted more broadly and quickly in the marketplace. Study 1 is a controlled laboratory experiment demonstrating how lexical repetition, a feature of the stimulus and not the consequence of repeated exposures, results in greater processing fluency. Study 2 replicates the effect utilizing custom-produced song excerpts holding everything constant except the lyrics. Utilizing data from Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart from 1958–2012, Study 3 documents how more repetitive songs stand a greater chance of reaching #1 as opposed to lingering at the bottom of the chart. An analysis of #1 hits reveals increased repetition decreases the time it takes to reach #1 and increases the odds of debuting in the Top 40. This research chronicles the impact of processing fluency on consumer choice in the real world while demonstrating repetition as a stimulus feature matters. It also introduces a new variable to the processing fluency literature: lexical repetition.The power of repetition: repetitive lyrics in a song increase processing fluency and drive market success - ScienceDirectThe authors contributed equally and are listed in alphabetical order.Cross-cultural perspectives on pitch memory - ScienceDirectWe examined effects of age and culture on children’s memory for the pitch level of familiar music. Canadian 9- and 10-year-olds distinguished the original pitch level of familiar television theme songs from foils that were pitch-shifted by one semitone, whereas 5- to 8-year-olds failed to do so (Experiment 1). In contrast, Japanese 5- and 6-year-olds distinguished the pitch-shifted foils from the originals, performing significantly better than same-age Canadian children (Experiment 2). Moreover, Japanese 6-year-olds were more accurate than their 5-year-old counterparts. These findings challenge the prevailing view of enhanced pitch memory during early life. We consider factors that may account for Japanese children’s superior performance such as their use of a pitch accent language (Japanese) rather than a stress accent language (English) and their experience with musical pitch labels.Training spatial ability: Comment on Pietsch and Jansen (2012) and prospective research trends - ScienceDirect► I comment on a recent paper by Pietsch and Jansen. ► The role of particular activities to complement traditional curriculums is discussed. ► In particular, I emphasize the benefits of motor activities to train spatial ability. ► I point out prospective research trends in the field of spatial ability training.Cerebellar patients demonstrate preserved implicit knowledge of association strengths in musical sequences - ScienceDirectRecent findings suggest the involvement of the cerebellum in perceptual and cognitive tasks. Our study investigated whether cerebellar patients show musical priming based on implicit knowledge of tonal-harmonic music. Participants performed speeded phoneme identification on sung target chords, which were either related or less-related to prime contexts in terms of the tonal-harmonic system. As groups, both cerebellar patients and age-matched controls showed facilitated processing for related targets, as previously observed for healthy young adults. The outcome suggests that an intact cerebellum is not mandatory for accessing implicit knowledge stored in long-term memory and for its influence on perception. One patient showed facilitated processing for less-related targets (suggesting sensory priming). The findings suggest directions for future research on auditory perception in cerebellar patients to further our understanding of cerebellar functions.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectElectrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectRandomly assigned schoolchildren discriminated syntactic violations in complex music.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectAn EEG microstate reminiscent of the N400 occurred in response to the violations.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectViolation discrimination correlated to microstate strength and to working memory.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectUnderlying generators were localized in premotor and parietal brain areas.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectChildren's processing of syntax and meaning may coincide in musical contexts.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectThe majority of studies on music processing in children used simple musical stimuli. Here, primary schoolchildren judged the appropriateness of musical closure in expressive polyphone music, while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Stimuli ended either regularly or contained refined in-key harmonic transgressions at closure. The children discriminated the transgressions well above chance. Regular and transgressed endings evoked opposite scalp voltage configurations peaking around 400 ms after stimulus onset with bilateral frontal negativity for regular and centro-posterior negativity (CPN) for transgressed endings. A positive correlation could be established between strength of the CPN response and rater sensitivity (d-prime). We also investigated whether the capacity to discriminate the transgressions was supported by auditory domain specific or general cognitive mechanisms, and found that working memory capacity predicted transgression discrimination. Latency and distribution of the CPN are reminiscent of the N400, typically observed in response to semantic incongruities in language. Therefore our observation is intriguing, as the CPN occurred here within an intra-musical context, without any symbols referring to the external world. Moreover, the harmonic in-key transgressions that we implemented may be considered syntactical as they transgress structural rules. Such structural incongruities in music are typically followed by an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) and an N5, but not so here. Putative contributive sources of the CPN were localized in left pre-motor, mid-posterior cingulate and superior parietal regions of the brain that can be linked to integration processing. These results suggest that, at least in children, processing of syntax and meaning may coincide in complex intra-musical contexts.Silent disco: dancing in synchrony leads to elevated pain thresholds and social closeness - ScienceDirectMoving in synchrony leads to cooperative behavior and feelings of social closeness, and dance (involving synchronization to others and music) may cause social bonding, possibly as a consequence of released endorphins. This study uses an experimental paradigm to determine which aspects of synchrony in dance are associated with changes in pain threshold (a proxy for endorphin release) and social bonding between strangers. Those who danced in synchrony experienced elevated pain thresholds, whereas those in the partial and asynchrony conditions experienced no analgesic effects. Similarly, those in the synchrony condition reported being more socially bonded, although they did not perform more cooperatively in an economic game. This experiment suggests that dance encourages social bonding among co-actors by stimulating the production of endorphins, but may not make people more altruistic. We conclude that dance may have been an important human behavior evolved to encourage social closeness between strangers.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectTo determine whether rhythmic music and metronome cues alter spatiotemporal gait measures and gait variability in people with Alzheimer disease (AD).Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectA repeated-measures study requiring participants to walk under different cueing conditions.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectUniversity movement laboratory.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectOf the people (N=46) who met study criteria (a diagnosis of probable AD and ability to walk 100m) at routine medical review, 30 (16 men; mean age ± SD, 80±6y; revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination range, 26–79) volunteered to participate.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectParticipants walked 4 times over an electronic walkway synchronizing to (1) rhythmic music and (2) a metronome set at individual mean baseline comfortable speed cadence.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectGait spatiotemporal measures and gait variability (coefficient of variation [CV]). Data from individual walks under each condition were combined. A 1-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare uncued baseline, cued, and retest measures.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectGait velocity decreased with both music and metronome cues compared with baseline (baseline, 110.5cm/s; music, 103.4cm/s; metronome, 105.4cm/s), primarily because of significant decreases in stride length (baseline, 120.9cm; music, 112.5cm; metronome, 114.8cm) with both cue types. This was coupled with increased stride length variability compared with baseline (baseline CV, 3.4%; music CV, 4.3%; metronome CV, 4.5%) with both cue types. These changes did not persist at (uncued) retest. Temporal variability was unchanged.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectRhythmic auditory cueing at comfortable speed tempo produced deleterious effects on gait in a single session in this group with AD.

Drawing on the cognition-affect-behavior (CAB) paradigm, this study aims to provide a conceptual framework explaining why consumers hesitate to use mobile channels for shopping and thus abandon their mobile shopping carts. Results from two studies show that mobile shopping cart abandonment is positively influenced by emotional ambivalence, a result of consumers' conflicting thoughts. More specifically, emotional ambivalence amplifies consumers' hesitation at the checkout stage, leading to cart abandonment. However, if hesitant consumers are satisfied with the choice process during shopping, they are less likely to give up their mobile shopping carts. Based on the findings, this mobile channel study provides practical and theoretical implications for marketers and e-cart abandonment researchers, respectively.Mobile shopping cart abandonment: The roles of conflicts, ambivalence, and hesitation - ScienceDirectGuei-Hua Huang is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Business Administration at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan.

Eighty participants, 32 males and 48 females, aged 66.96 ± 11.73, volunteered for this study. The participants were randomly divided into the four following groups: Resistance Group (RG; n = 20), involved in high intensity strength training; Cardiovascular Group (CVG; n = 20), involved in high intensity cardiovascular training; Postural Group (PG; n = 20) involved in low intensity training, based on postural and balance exercises; and Control Group (CG; n = 20). Exercises were performed over the course of 12 weeks. All participants were tested for their cognitive functions pre- and post-intervention using the following neurocognitive tests: the Attentive Matrices Test, Raven's Progressive Matrices, Stroop Color and Word Interference Test, Trail Making Test and Drawing Copy Test. Statistical analysis showed that the CVG group improved significantly in the Attentive Matrices Test and Raven's Progressive Matrices (both p = < 0.05), whereas the RG group improved in Drawing Copy Test time (p = < 0.05). These results confirm that different types of exercise interventions have unique effects on cognition. Cardiovascular training is effective in improving performance attentive and analytic tasks, whereas resistance training is effective in improving praxis. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the combination of the two exercise types in order to ascertain if their respective effects can be summated when performed together.Amusics can imitate what they cannot discriminate - ScienceDirectA longstanding issue in psychology is the relationship between how we perceive the world and how we act upon it. Pitch deafness provides an interesting opportunity to test for the independence of perception and production abilities in the speech domain. We tested eight amusics and eight matched controls for their ability to perceive pitch shifts in sentences and to imitate those same sentences. Congenital amusics were impaired in their ability to discriminate, but not to imitate different intonations in speech. These findings support the idea that, when we hear a vocally-imitatable sound, our brains encode it in two distinct ways- an abstract code, which allows us to identify it and compare it to other sounds, and a vocal-motor code, which allows us to imitate it.Amusics can imitate what they cannot discriminate - ScienceDirect► Amusics are impaired in their ability to discriminate pitch changes in sentences. ► Amusics show no impairment in imitating those same pitch changes in sentences. ► This is evidence for a dissociation between pitch perception and production. ► Our results support a dual-route framework for pitch perception and production. ► We demonstrate that music-relevant impairments can affect language processing.The associate impact of individual internal experiences and reference groups on buying behavior: A case study of animations, comics, and games consumers - ScienceDirectThe associate impact of individual internal experiences and reference groups on buying behavior: A case study of animations, comics, and games consumers - ScienceDirectWe analyzed the influences of both internal cognitions and external environments on the loyalty of animations, comics, and video games consumers.The associate impact of individual internal experiences and reference groups on buying behavior: A case study of animations, comics, and games consumers - ScienceDirectWe evaluated consumers’ internal cognitions through the five experiences in the strategic experiential module, and evaluated external influences through the influences of reference groups.The associate impact of individual internal experiences and reference groups on buying behavior: A case study of animations, comics, and games consumers - ScienceDirectWe applied the uncomplicated decision tree data mining method to analyze the hidden association rules between the consumer loyalty and the critical influential factors of consumer’s internal impressions and external influences.The associate impact of individual internal experiences and reference groups on buying behavior: A case study of animations, comics, and games consumers - ScienceDirectAmong the entertainment and media market, it can be observed that animations, comics, and video games (hereinafter abbreviated as ACG) have the highest output value and most market influence. Moreover, ACG also incorporates various industries and creates many derivative products. As the ACG industry emphasizes acousto-optics, imagery, and storylines, personal impressions derived from consumer experiences will influence consumer decisions. In addition, the ACG industry is mainly marketed towards younger age groups, with younger people being the main consumers; as such, these consumers’ decisions are more easily affected by peer behavior.The associate impact of individual internal experiences and reference groups on buying behavior: A case study of animations, comics, and games consumers - ScienceDirectThis study aims to analyze the effects of internal cognitions and external influences on buying behavior of ACG consumers by applying the uncomplicated decision tree data mining algorithm. We analyze and develop the target attributes on measures of customer loyalty for ACG industry to set up the decision trees from the collected questionnaire data. The decision tree data mining method is applied to analyze the hidden association rules between the target attributes (i.e., consumer loyalty) and the critical influencing factors of consumer’s internal impressions and external influences for ACG consumers. The results and suggestions of this paper can be used as a reference for enterprises in the ACG industry to help with business policies concerning products’ extensional design, marketing, and CRM, and to further strengthen customer satisfaction and loyalty, thus increasing company profits.Different types of experimentally induced sad mood? - ScienceDirectMood-induction procedures have been useful to investigate the role of dysfunctional cognitions in depression. In general, studies have shown that individuals with a history of depression endorse more dysfunctional attitudes following the induction of sad mood than never-depressed individuals. However, a recent study failed to find the expected differences between previously depressed and never-depressed participants. In the present study, two widely used mood-induction procedures were compared to investigate the possibility that different mood inductions lead to different outcomes. Forty-eight participants underwent two types of sad mood induction: focusing on a sad memory while listening to music and watching a movie fragment. Consistent with modern cognitive theory, mood-state dependency of dysfunctional cognitions (cognitive reactivity) was much higher in vulnerable individuals. This effect occurred during both mood inductions. However, the effects of the music induction were somewhat larger, and the correlation between change of mood and cognitive reactivity was significant in this condition only. Some other subtle differences between both procedures were found. In conclusion, although the effects of both inductions were largely similar, the musical induction is more sensitive, and is preferable for research into cognitive dysfunction in depression.Emotion and attention interactions in social cognition: Brain regions involved in processing anger prosody - ScienceDirectMultiple levels of processing are thought to be involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant events, with some processes being engaged relatively independently of attention, whereas other processes may depend on attention and current task goals or context. We conducted an event-related fMRI experiment to examine how processing angry voice prosody, an affectively and socially salient signal, is modulated by voluntary attention. To manipulate attention orthogonally to emotional prosody, we used a dichotic listening paradigm in which meaningless utterances, pronounced with either angry or neutral prosody, were presented simultaneously to both ears on each trial. In two successive blocks, participants selectively attended to either the left or right ear and performed a gender-decision on the voice heard on the target side. Our results revealed a functional dissociation between different brain areas. Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was heard from a to-be-attended or to-be-ignored voice, the orbitofrontal cortex and the cuneus in medial occipital cortex showed greater activation to the same emotional stimuli when the angry voice was to-be-attended rather than to-be-ignored. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed a strong correlation between orbitofrontal regions and sensitivity on a behavioral inhibition scale measuring proneness to anxiety reactions. Our results underscore the importance of emotion and attention interactions in social cognition by demonstrating that multiple levels of processing are involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant cues in voices, and by showing a modulation of some emotional responses by both the current task-demands and individual differences.Emotion and attention interactions in social cognition: Brain regions involved in processing anger prosody - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Cognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectCognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectCognitive approaches explain emotions in ways that enable people to understand their experience of them.Cognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectEmotions are caused by evaluations of events or people in relation to concerns.Cognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectAccounts are offered of three representative cognitive theories of emotions: the action-readiness theory, the core-affect theory, and the communicative theory.Cognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectThe communicative theory of emotions explains how psychological illnesses are caused.Cognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectThe communicative theory explains how emotions function in social relations, reasoning, music, and fiction.Cognitive approaches to emotions - ScienceDirectCognitive approaches offer clear links between how emotions are thought about in everyday life and how they are investigated psychologically. Cognitive researchers have focused on how emotions are caused when events or other people affect concerns and on how emotions influence processes such as reasoning, memory, and attention. Three representative cognitive theories of emotion continue to develop productively: the action-readiness theory, the core-affect theory, and the communicative theory. Some principles are common to them and divergences can be resolved by future research. Recent explanations have included how emotions structure social relationships, how they function in psychological illnesses, and how they are central to music and fiction.Music therapy assessment of emotionally disturbed children - ScienceDirectSimply viewed, the descriptive assessment outlines basic musical directions that the child may pursue. Additional observations and the interpretation of musical behaviors and preferences are anecdotal and therefore highly subjective. The descriptive assessment is in the process of being refined further for use by clinicians. It is introduced to the reader in this preliminary article in order to stimulate clinical thinking.Music therapy assessment of emotionally disturbed children - ScienceDirectKaren Goodman is full-time Assistant Professor of Music Therapy at Montclair State College, N.J. and practices music therapy privately. She wishesTesting meter, rhythm, and tempo discriminations in pigeons - ScienceDirectRhythmic grouping and discrimination is fundamental to music. When compared to the perception of pitch, rhythmic abilities in animals have received scant attention until recently. In this experiment, four pigeons were tested with three types of auditory rhythmic discriminations to investigate their processing of this aspect of sound and music. Two experiments examined a meter discrimination in which successively presented idiophonic sounds were repeated in meters of different lengths in a go/no-go discrimination task. With difficulty, the birds eventually learned to discriminate between 8/4 and 3/4 meters constructed from cymbal and tom drum sounds at 180 beats per minute. This discrimination subsequently transferred to faster tempos, but not to different drum sounds or their combination. Experiment 3 tested rhythmic and arrhythmic patterns of sounds. After 40 sessions of training, these same pigeons showed no discrimination. Experiment 4 tested repetitions of a piano sound at fast and slow tempos. This discrimination was readily learned and showed transfer to novel tempos. The pattern of results suggests that pigeons can time periodic auditory events, but their capacity to understand generalized rhythmic groupings appears limited.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectTango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectArgentine tango can improve balance in patients with Parkinson's disease.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectThere was no benefit of tango on motor severity of Parkinson's disease.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectTango has modest benefits upon cognition and fatigue.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectTango classes are highly enjoyable and give overall satisfaction.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectThe social aspects that emerged from the tango classes have positive effects.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectTo determine effects of Argentine tango on motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectRandomized control trial.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectForty patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectMovement disorder clinic and dance studio.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectTwo randomized groups: group (N = 18) with 24 partnered tango classes, and control self-directed exercise group (N = 15).Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectThe primary outcome was overall motor severity. Secondary outcomes included other motor measures, balance, cognition, fatigue, apathy, depression and quality of life.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectOn the primary intention-to-treat analysis there was no difference in motor severity between groups MDS-UPDRS-3 (1.6 vs.1.2-point reduction, p = 0.85). Patient-rated clinical global impression of change did not differ (p = 0.33), however examiner rating improved in favor of tango (p = 0.02). Mini-BESTest improved in the tango group compared to controls (0.7 ± 2.2 vs. −2.7 ± 5.9, p = 0.032). Among individual items, tango improved in both simple TUG time (−1.3 ± 1.6 s vs. 0.1 ± 2.3, p = 0.042) and TUG Dual Task score (0.4 ± 0.9 vs. −0.2 ± 0.4, p = 0.012), with borderline improvement in walk with pivot turns (0.2 ± 0.5 vs. −0.1 ± 0.5, p = 0.066).

Tango participants found the activity more enjoyable (p < 0.001) and felt more “overall” treatment satisfaction (p < 0.001). We found no significant differences in other outcomes or adverse events.Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease: A randomized control study - ScienceDirectArgentine tango can improve balance, and functional mobility, and may have modest benefits upon cognition and fatigue in Parkinson's disease. These findings must be confirmed in longer-term trials explicitly powered for cognition and fatigue.Music as a Resource to Develop Cognition - ScienceDirectThe paper focuses on cognition as an element for human development and application of musical language resources in order to stimulate and strengthen neural connections favorable for learning.

There is great variation in preference patterns for music. However, the cause of such individual differences has not been fully elucidated to date. Many behavioral traits, including personality, are known to be influenced by steroid-hormone testosterone. On this basis, we conjectured that testosterone partly determines individual differences in music preference. To examine this hypothesis, in the present study, we investigated the association between salivary testosterone concentration and strength of preference for five different music types in young males and females. The results revealed a significant negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music, such as classical and jazz in males. This relationship was not mediated by the big-five personality traits. These findings indicate the possibility that neuroendocrinological function can exert influences on music preference patterns.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectMusic exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectEarly music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of rats.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectThe BDNF/TrkB level of DH CA3 and DG was obviously increased by exposed to music.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectThe enhanced spatial memory is associated with BDNF/TrkB level of DH CA3 and DG.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectPrevious research has shown that dorsal hippocampus plays an important role in spatial memory process. Music exposure can enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression level in dorsal hippocampus (DH) and thus enhance spatial cognition ability. But whether music experience may affect different subregions of DH in the same degree remains unclear. Here, we studied the effects of exposure to Mozart K.448 on learning behavior in developing rats using the classical Morris water maze task. The results showed that early music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of the rats in the water maze test. Meanwhile, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA3 (dCA3) and dentate gyrus (dDG) was significantly enhanced in rats exposed to Mozart music as compared to those without music exposure. In contrast, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) was not affected. The results suggest that the spatial memory improvement by music exposure in rats may be associated with the enhanced BDNF/TrkB level of dCA3 and dDG.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectComplexity measures of music - ScienceDirectWe address the issue of detecting the crucial events in music by analyzing the volume change of a music piece.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectIt is found that multifractality of the Mozart piece performed by human is broader than the one played by computer.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectThe power spectrum confirms the existence of 1/f noise in studied music pieces.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectEffect of music intervention on apathy in nursing home residents with dementia - ScienceDirectEffect of music intervention on apathy in nursing home residents with dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectWe investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular on-demand music streaming services.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectOur study resulted into two variants, differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method, NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second method, NeuroPicksVQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectBeyond the feature engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems, while NeuroPicksVQ can control the selection of music tracks.

Sixteen sessions were conducted simultaneously to the pharmacological therapy.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectCognitive performances, mood, interpersonal interactions, and perceived abilities were assessed using standardized neuropsychological and psycho-behavioural measurements.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectAt baseline, the patient reported a tendency to feel tense, nervous, and angry and difficulties in memory and visuospatial performances, frequently accompanied by attention drops. The social network was a habitual component of the patient's life, but not a source of sharing of personal experiences, safety or comfort. Neuropsychological tests showed deficits in object and figure naming, verbal fluency, short and long-term verbal memory, short-term spatial memory, selective attention, and visuomotor coordination.

However, no research has previously investigated the development of music skills in this population. In this study, we used the cross-sectional developmental trajectories approach to assess the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Thus, we evaluated the role of change over time on pitch-related music skills and the developmental relationships between music skills and different cognitive areas. In the TD children, the pitch-related music skills improved with chronological age and cognitive development. In the children with WS, developmental relationships were only found between several pitch-related music skills and specific cognitive processes. We also found non-systematic relationships between chronological age and the pitch-related music skills, stabilization in the level reached in music when cognitive development was considered, and uneven associations between cognitive and music skills. In addition, the TD and WS groups differed in their patterns of pitch-related music skill development. These results suggest that the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS is atypical. Our findings stand in contrast with the views that claim innate modularity for music in WS; rather, they are consistent with neuroconstructivist accounts.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectMozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectMozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectMusic Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectWe examined effects of more vs. less time in kindergarten general music.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with stronger executive functions.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with more positive attitudes about self and school.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIndividuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectIndividuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirect12 males with major depression (MDD) completed measures of anhedonia and depression.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectAlso underwent fMRI whilst listening to preferred classical music.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectMDD group showed less activation of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) than healthy controls.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectMDD group showed attenuation of NAcc response in later compared to earlier times.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectSupports theories that MDD involves inability to sustain reward network activation.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectWe investigated the ability of preferred classical music to activate the nucleus accumbens in patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve males with MDD and 10 never mentally ill male healthy controls (HC) completed measures of anhedonia and depression severity, and listened to 90-second segments of preferred classical music during fMRI. Compared to HCs, individuals with MDD showed less activation of the left nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Individuals with MDD showed attenuation of the left NAcc response in later compared to earlier parts of the experiment, supporting theories that MDD involves an inability to sustain reward network activation. Counter intuitively, we found that NAcc activity during early music listening was associated with greater depression severity. In whole-brain analyses, anhedonia scores predicted activity in regions within the default mode network, supporting previous findings. Our results support theories that MDD involves an inability to sustain reward network activation. It also highlights that pleasant classical music can engage critical neural reward circuitry in MDD.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectMicrosaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectWe applied an attentional definition for state absorption.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectMicrosaccade rates are known to be linked to attentional processing and cognitive load.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectHere we show that microsaccade rate is also linked to state absorption during intense music listening.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectResults indicate that absorption can be measured indirectly by cross-modal interactions using eye tracking.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectThe power of music is a literary topos, which can be attributed to intense and personally significant experiences, one of them being the state of absorption. Such phenomenal states are difficult to grasp objectively. We investigated the state of musical absorption by using eye tracking. We utilized a load related definition of state absorption: multimodal resources are committed to create a unified representation of music. Resource allocation was measured indirectly by microsaccade rate, known to indicate cognitive processing load. We showed in Exp. 1 that microsaccade rate also indicates state absorption. Hence, there is cross-modal coupling between an auditory aesthetic experience and fixational eye movements. When removing the fixational stimulus in Exp. 2, saccades are no longer generated upon visual input and the cross-modal coupling disappeared. Results are interpreted in favor of the load hypothesis of microsaccade rate and against the assumption of general slowing by state absorption.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectMusic performance anxiety and perfectionism affect adult musicians.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe study examined the development of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age children.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThere was a strong correlations between music performance anxiety and perfectionism between ages 10 and 17.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectLevels of music performance anxiety and perfectionism increase with years of experience.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures?

Across three experiments, we find that vocal music leads to poorer cognitive and attitudinal outcomes for consumers lower in working memory capacity but does not affect those higher in working memory capacity. However, short-term habituation to background music helps mitigate this negative effect of vocal music on consumer ad recall. Finally, consumer performances on computing discount prices are also affected by music type depending upon whether prices are communicated in verbal or numeric form. Overall, this research lays out an executive-attention based process mechanism explaining when and how background music shapes consumer learning and memory. The outlined theory enriches the literature on music effects as well as immediate-term learning by explicating the role of selective attention in the processing of multi-modal marketing stimuli.Role of executive attention in consumer learning with background music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Brain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectBrain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectGuided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMusic and imagery was used for management of PTSD symptoms in women who had experienced Military Sexual Trauma.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectParticipants used music to regulate emotions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectImagery was a learned resource for grounding.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectEffects carried over between sessions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectThree out of four participants scored clinically significant reductions and one out of four scored a reliable reduction of PTSD symptoms.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMilitary Sexual Trauma (MST) is an issue among returning veterans that causes a significant amount of distress with a high occurrence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

The present study investigated the performance of skilled musicians on cognitively demanding sustained attention tasks, measuring both temporal and visual discrimination over a prolonged duration. Participants with extensive formal music training were found to have superior performance on a temporal discrimination task, but not a visual discrimination task, compared to participants with no music training. In addition, no differences were found between groups in vigilance decrement in either type of task. Although no differences were evident in vigilance per se, the results indicate that performance in an attention-demanding temporal discrimination task was superior in individuals with extensive music training. We speculate that this basic cognitive ability may contribute to advantages that musicians show in other cognitive measures.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectAddress: 3026 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, United States.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectNeural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectPianists imitated or listened to chord sequences with harmonic violations in fMRI.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectfMRI and rfMRI-connectivity showed dorsal motor and ventral audio streams for music.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectRight IFG is likely to integrate harmonic information in motor and audio format.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectParietal/temporal areas may be tied to motoric and auditory knowledge of harmony.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectThe ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tracting the neural basis of music: Deficient structural connectivity underlying acquired amusia - ScienceDirectAcquired amusia provides a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental neural architectures of musical processing due to the transition from a functioning to defective music processing system. Yet, the white matter (WM) deficits in amusia remain systematically unexplored. To evaluate which WM structures form the neural basis for acquired amusia and its recovery, we studied 42 stroke patients longitudinally at acute, 3-month, and 6-month post-stroke stages using DTI [tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and deterministic tractography (DT)] and the Scale and Rhythm subtests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA). Non-recovered amusia was associated with structural damage and subsequent degeneration in multiple WM tracts including the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and frontal aslant tract (FAT), as well as in the corpus callosum (CC) and its posterior part (tapetum). In a linear regression analysis, the volume of the right IFOF was the main predictor of MBEA performance across time. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the large-scale deficits in intra- and interhemispheric structural connectivity underlying amusia, and conversely highlight which pathways are crucial for normal music perception.Tracting the neural basis of music: Deficient structural connectivity underlying acquired amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectThe appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectSad music is listened to more commonly in sad moods and negative situations.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectMotivations for listening to sad music include validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectListening to sad music might be particularly helpful when people are experiencing negative life events.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectListening to sad music may be more adaptive for psychologically healthy people who are also more like to apply healthy coping strategies.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectDepressed individuals and ruminators use sad music both adaptively and maladaptive.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectAfter happiness, sadness is the most common emotion attributed to music. A recent proliferation of research has provided intense focus on the reasons why sad music is so popular. The research presented in this paper aims to summarize the results of recent studies. The findings indicate that many people report that they choose to listen to sad music when experiencing sadness, and after experiencing negative events. A range of motivations have been found as to why people choose to listen to sad music, these include the role of music in; validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation. For people who listen to sad music as an adaptive way to cope, some evidence in this review indicates that this may be a healthy strategy more applicable for psychologically healthy people, rather than those who are depressed or anxious. Findings indicate that depressed individuals, and ruminators, can use sad music adaptively, but also maladaptively. Sad music has also been shown to provide support when people are experiencing negative life events, as it enables the expression, identification, and understanding of the situation, which in turn aids the experience of consolation, and, ultimately, acceptance coping. Future directions for research, and the potential uses of sad music listening in therapeutic settings are discussed.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectMusic therapy is one of the types of active ageing programmes which are offered to elderly people.

For the perception of such structures, the detection of each boundary is crucial. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we explore the perception of hierarchical boundaries in music, and test whether musical expertise modifies such processing. Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectPast research has demonstrated that music often negatively impacts performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, including academically relevant tasks. There are, however, discrepancies in the literature, including a handful of instances where no effect of music was observed. We tested the novel hypothesis that working-memory capacity moderated the detrimental effect of music on academic performance. Undergraduate students worked on reading-comprehension and math tasks under both music and silence conditions before completing a battery of working-memory capacity assessments. Although music led to a significant decline in performance overall, working-memory capacity moderated this effect in the reading-comprehension tasks. These findings suggest that individuals who are better able to control their attention (as indexed by working-memory capacity) may be protected from music-related distraction when completing certain kinds of academically relevant tasks.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectAuthor NoteGenetic algorithms for music variation on genom platform - ScienceDirectThis paper considers the problems of algorithmic music variations and modeling of musical creativity in general with a help of genetic algorithms.

The cause of this is probably that neurosurgery had not been developed yet in the first half of the 20th century. In the past 3 decades, the neurosurgical operations of musicians show that musicians have rich associations among auditory, somatic, and sensorial systems.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectIt is clear that we have much to learn from studies about music and brain function that derive from our surgical experiences with patients. The neuronal plasticity of musicians' brains may be different from that of nonmusicians' brains. Musicians with enhanced motor skills have greater capacity for plasticity because of enriched interhemispheric connections. Listening to music and the effect of Mozart in neurosurgical practice, intensive care, or rehabilitation were documented in many studies. As authors, we mean something different: Its effectiveness should be studied. We concluded that in current neurosurgical practice, Mozart has an effect.

Three different approaches were taken. The first approach was a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of 18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identified style characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two reference pitches, the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations (for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, T. (1997). Self-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer). One model was trained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral experiment including the correct continuation tone, while another was trained with a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The convergence of the three approaches showed that both listeners and the SOM model are influenced by the statistical distributions of tones and tone sequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided evidence supporting a core set of psychological principles underlying melody formation whose relative weights appear to differ across musical styles.Cross-cultural music cognition: cognitive methodology applied to North Sami yoiks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music (e.g., Chinese, Indian) increased the recall of menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music increased the likelihood of choosing menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectClassical music increased willingness to pay for products related to social identity.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCountry music increased willingness to pay for utilitarian products.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic congruity effects on consumer behavior are conceptualized in terms of cognitive priming of semantic networks in memory, and operationalized as congruent with a product's country of origin (Experiment 1), or congruent with the utilitarian (Experiment 2) or social identity (Experiments 2 and 3) connotations of a product. Hearing a specific genre of music (e.g., classical) activates related concepts in memory (e.g., expensive, sophisticated, formal, educated), which influences the memory for, perception of, and choice of products. Consistent with this account of music congruity effects, three laboratory experiments show that playing music of a specific genre during initial product exposure improved subsequent recall of conceptually related (i.e., congruent) products compared to unrelated products (Experiment 1), affected product choice in favor of congruent products (Experiment 1), and affected how much participants were willing to pay for congruent products (Experiments 2 and 3).Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 7867.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 9279.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectBrain signals are recorded using EEG headset while listening to audio music.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectFour different emotions are recognized using hybrid features of EEG signals.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectEmotion recognition accuracy is analyzed for three different age groups.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectThe relationship between music genres and human emotions is examined.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (354KB)Download full-size imageHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectMusic streaming systems that are useful and provide enjoyment lead to adoption.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectSystems that are useful and provide enjoyment reduce digital piracy.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of creativity facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of community facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectPreventing unauthorized downloading and other forms of digital piracy has been a persistent challenge.

The results of this field study involving 139 subjects suggest that music streaming systems that incorporate features that facilitate individual creativity and community building contributes towards the enjoyment and usefulness of the system. This in turn leads to music streaming adoption. The results of the study also show that the usefulness of a music streaming system is associated with a reduction in pirating intention. Surprisingly, a link between the enjoyment of a music streaming system and a reduction in digital pirating intention was not supported.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (137KB)Download full-size imageThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectAn e-learning collaborative environment for music composing was examined.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectWe used assessment thorough video analysis and a semi-structured interview.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe technological context reshaped thinking and collaborative strategies.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCollaboration, identity and meta-cognition were critical.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe participants demonstrated awareness of the potentialities of the online tools.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectMusic and academic performance - ScienceDirectStudents who select music courses have better grades than the others in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCognitive mechanisms related to overcoming cognitive dissonances are discussed.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectEnjoyment of music might cause academic improvement.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectIn a previous study we demonstrated that listening to a pleasant music while performing an academic test helped students to overcome stress, to devote more time to more stressful and more complicated task and the grades were higher. Yet, there remained ambiguities as for the causes of the higher test performance of these students: do they perform better because they hear music during their examinations, or would they perform better anyway because they are more gifted/motivated? This motivated the current study as a preliminary step toward that general question: Do students who like/perform music have better grades than the others? Our results confirmed this hypothesis: students studying music have better grades in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing - ScienceDirectMusic notation and English word reading both involve mapping horizontally arranged visual components to components in sound, in contrast to reading in logographic languages such as Chinese. Accordingly, music-reading expertise may influence English word processing more than Chinese character processing. Here we showed that musicians named English words significantly faster than non-musicians when words were presented in the left visual field/right hemisphere (RH) or the center position, suggesting an advantage of RH processing due to music reading experience. This effect was not observed in Chinese character naming. A follow-up ERP study showed that in a sequential matching task, musicians had reduced RH N170 responses to English non-words under the processing of musical segments as compared with non-musicians, suggesting a shared visual processing mechanism in the RH between music notation and English non-word reading. This shared mechanism may be related to the letter-by-letter, serial visual processing that characterizes RH English word recognition (e.g., Lavidor & Ellis, 2001), which may consequently facilitate English word processing in the RH in musicians. Thus, music reading experience may have differential influences on the processing of different languages, depending on their similarities in the cognitive processes involved.Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectMelody similarity in music is a perception of listeners based on cognitive method. Thus, the algorithms should be based on perceptually oriented computational model. We have used computer generated synthesized tune of popular song and its variations to understand similarity notion. We have generated variations of a tune by changing musical scale or relative duration of notes or notes itself and combination of them. The proposed approach to calculate similarity relationship between two tunes will be useful to model the melody similarity notion for various applications such as QBH (Query by humming), music classification and retrieval, music plagiarism etc.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of International Conference on Advanced Computing Technologies and Applications (ICACTA-2015).Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectListening to happy music affected functional cerebral asymmetries.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectLeft hemispheric functioning was particularly sensitive to music listening.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in laterality were not mediated by changes in mood.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectTempo manipulation of the musical excerpt did not modulate the laterality effect.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectAdults with schizophrenia are less discriminative for harmonic changes in music, therefore, the perceptual and cognitive processing of understanding and responding to music may not be the same as that of healthy adults.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectSP group showed less sensitivity to the increased level of harmonic complexity within the music, suggesting that their evaluation of music complexity was not coherent.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectNo significant differences were found between groups in terms of their interest in and preference for harmonic progression in music.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe use of harmonic progression for adults with schizophrenia can be effectively considered in music selection.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectMusic therapists should incorporate an appropriate level of harmonic complexity in the music when used in mental health settings.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe first two authors are co-first authors and contributed equally to this work.Realising the potential of art-based interventions in managerial learning: Embodied cognition as an explanatory theory - ScienceDirectTeachers and consultants increasingly use art-based interventions (ABIs) to facilitate manager learning. However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which ABIs produce learning outcomes of value to organizations. This theoretical paper addresses this concern by revisiting the philosophy of art and education in light of developments in neuroscience known as embodied cognition. Specifically, we examine the role played by simulations in behavioral change and the way in which ABIs can foster the creation of simulations. This leads to two propositions, a) representing a phenomenon through new simulations can create new possibilities for interacting with this phenomenon; and b) making art is a means by which managers can construct new simulations. The significance of these propositions is illustrated by re-interpreting three accounts of art-based interventions found in the literature. These propositions have important implications for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ABIs in management education. In particular, they emphasize the need to match art medium with desired outcomes, provide support for the view that ABIs are well suited to learning about complex managerial challenges, and question the effectiveness of verbal reflection as part of ABIs.Realising the potential of art-based interventions in managerial learning: Embodied cognition as an explanatory theory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mentalising music in frontotemporal dementia - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectTen untrained subjects listened to 3 culturally different styles of music stimuli.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were measured and global and local network properties compared.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectLight music and western classical music perception manifested small world properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectChinese and western classical music perception showed right lateralization.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectFurther research is needed to understand network properties of music perception.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectGraph theoretical analysis has recently become a popular research tool in neuroscience, however, there have been very few studies on brain responses to music perception, especially when culturally different styles of music are involved.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music. For event-related potentials, phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and then constructed into correlation matrices. Clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths were evaluated for global properties, while clustering coefficients and efficiency were assessed for local network properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectPerception of light music and western classical music manifested small-world network properties, especially with a relatively low proportion of weights of correlation matrices.

The aim of this prospective study was to verify the efficacy of a Non-Instrumental Musical Training (NIMT) on the Numerical Cognition systems in children with low achievement in math. For this purpose, we examined, with a cluster analysis, whether children with low scores on Numerical Cognition would be grouped in the same cluster at pre and post-NIMT. Participants were primary school children divided into two groups according to their scores on an Arithmetic test. Results with a specialized battery of Numerical Cognition revealed improvements for Cluster 2 (children with low achievement in math) especially for number production capacity compared to normative data. Besides, the number of children with low scores in Numerical Cognition decreased at post-NIMT. These findings suggest that NIMT enhances Numerical Cognition and seems to be a useful tool for rehabilitation of children with low achievement in math.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well. However, studies in recent decades reported a lack of satisfaction in music perception with cochlear implants. This article reviews the literature on music ability of cochlear implant users by presenting a systematic outline of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant recipients with regard to their music perception as well as production. The review also evaluates the similarities and differences between electric hearing and acoustic hearing regarding music perception. We summarize the research results in terms of the individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and timbre). Finally, we briefly introduce the vocal singing of prelingually-deafened children with cochlear implants as evaluated by acoustic measures.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music has been tried in children with refractory encephalopathies.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMusic therapy decreased seizure recurrence in about 45% of children.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectAll responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in both adults and young patients.

The objective of the research is to document the experiences of music teachers in using locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study in south-eastern Estonian schools. As the main research problem, the question was posed: how and to what extent do teachers use their locality-related traditions in music lessons at the second stage of study? The research questions developed to solve the problem aimed to find out how music teachers define the concept of locality-related tradition and whether and how they utilize locality-related tradition in music lessons.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectLocal Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectMusic Spectrum: A Music Immersion Virtual Environment for Children with Autism - ScienceDirectVisual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectThis study looks into the visual perception of phrasing in a Tai Chi routine as affected by a change of music. The research aimed to investigate whether the quality of phrasing between music and movement is improved with a more congruent accompaniment. Sixty respondents, undergraduate music majors from two universities in Malaysia, were invited to participate in this study. They were asked to evaluate the phrasing between music and movement in videos of the same Tai Chi routine but with two different music accompaniments. It was found that there is a significant difference in the evaluation, and that the video with music composed to provide a better congruence in phrasing received a higher rating.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is characterized by verbal memory delays and a love of music.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWe examine if novel (unfamiliar) music can enhance verbal memory in WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThose with formal music training showed improved verbal memory.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectFormal music training may enhance educational outcomes for those with WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children performed better at auditory but not visual statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children also showed larger changes in online statistical learning ERPs.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in musical abilities are associated with capacity for statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe question whether musical training is associated with enhanced auditory and cognitive abilities in children is of considerable interest.

Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectA combination of acoustic and neurophysiological features are used to attempt to predict music-induced emotion.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectSignificant prediction results are achieved.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThese results are significantly better when a combination of features is used than either feature alone.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectFeatures selected include alpha and beta band powers and mel-cepstral coefficients.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectIt is widely acknowledged that music can communicate and induce a wide range of emotions in the listener. However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectCognition in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectAnalysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to find out the extent to which Slovenian general education teachers follow the principles of a balanced music objectives planning in the prevailing affective, psychomotor and cognitive domains.

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched.

It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectThe Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music.

We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectFree listening of music evokes ERPs similar to simplified stimuli.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectRapid changes in musical features of polyphonic music evoke N100 and P200 response.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectThe N100 and P200 responses are detected across different musical genres.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe study provides a detailed analysis of the music experiences of clients in treatment for alcohol and drug problems.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectClients of a hospital alcohol and drug service said that music listening intensified their emotional response to drug taking and vice versa.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectForty-three percent of the clients in residential rehabilitation identified a specific song or genre of music that cued an urge to use substances.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMechanisms linking music with cravings included associations with their previous substance use; music evoked emotions associated with previous substance use; and music contained lyrics concerning their primary substance.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectA majority of clients endorsed a view that music was important in their recovery from substance misuse.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMusic is commonly associated with substance use yet little is known about the music experiences of adults with substance use disorders. In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery.

It must react in realtime to audio signals from musicians, according to a timed high-level requirement called mixed score, written in a domain specific language. Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThis work has been partly supported by a DGA-MRIS scholarship and the project Inedit (ANR-12-CORD-009).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectDGA Direction Generale de l'Armement (French national defense).Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectPerceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectDavid E.

As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe show that respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectArgue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectIn spite of its importance as a life-defining rhythmic movement and its constant rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the body, respiration has not received attention in Embodied Cognition (EC) literature. Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBoth video games and music can increase physical excitement.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate a higher level than nonviolent video games.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThe excitement of background music interacts with game on aggression.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate more aggression regardless of pleasure level of music.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Matthias Rauterberg.Music as a Resource to Develop Cognition - ScienceDirectThe paper focuses on cognition as an element for human development and application of musical language resources in order to stimulate and strengthen neural connections favorable for learning.

There is great variation in preference patterns for music. However, the cause of such individual differences has not been fully elucidated to date. Many behavioral traits, including personality, are known to be influenced by steroid-hormone testosterone. On this basis, we conjectured that testosterone partly determines individual differences in music preference. To examine this hypothesis, in the present study, we investigated the association between salivary testosterone concentration and strength of preference for five different music types in young males and females. The results revealed a significant negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music, such as classical and jazz in males. This relationship was not mediated by the big-five personality traits. These findings indicate the possibility that neuroendocrinological function can exert influences on music preference patterns.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectMusic exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectEarly music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of rats.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectThe BDNF/TrkB level of DH CA3 and DG was obviously increased by exposed to music.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectThe enhanced spatial memory is associated with BDNF/TrkB level of DH CA3 and DG.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectPrevious research has shown that dorsal hippocampus plays an important role in spatial memory process. Music exposure can enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression level in dorsal hippocampus (DH) and thus enhance spatial cognition ability. But whether music experience may affect different subregions of DH in the same degree remains unclear. Here, we studied the effects of exposure to Mozart K.448 on learning behavior in developing rats using the classical Morris water maze task. The results showed that early music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of the rats in the water maze test. Meanwhile, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA3 (dCA3) and dentate gyrus (dDG) was significantly enhanced in rats exposed to Mozart music as compared to those without music exposure. In contrast, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) was not affected. The results suggest that the spatial memory improvement by music exposure in rats may be associated with the enhanced BDNF/TrkB level of dCA3 and dDG.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectComplexity measures of music - ScienceDirectWe address the issue of detecting the crucial events in music by analyzing the volume change of a music piece.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectIt is found that multifractality of the Mozart piece performed by human is broader than the one played by computer.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectThe power spectrum confirms the existence of 1/f noise in studied music pieces.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectEffect of music intervention on apathy in nursing home residents with dementia - ScienceDirectEffect of music intervention on apathy in nursing home residents with dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectWe investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular on-demand music streaming services.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectOur study resulted into two variants, differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving distinct applications in online streaming music platforms.

The social network was a habitual component of the patient's life, but not a source of sharing of personal experiences, safety or comfort. Neuropsychological tests showed deficits in object and figure naming, verbal fluency, short and long-term verbal memory, short-term spatial memory, selective attention, and visuomotor coordination.

However, no research has previously investigated the development of music skills in this population. In this study, we used the cross-sectional developmental trajectories approach to assess the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Thus, we evaluated the role of change over time on pitch-related music skills and the developmental relationships between music skills and different cognitive areas. In the TD children, the pitch-related music skills improved with chronological age and cognitive development. In the children with WS, developmental relationships were only found between several pitch-related music skills and specific cognitive processes. We also found non-systematic relationships between chronological age and the pitch-related music skills, stabilization in the level reached in music when cognitive development was considered, and uneven associations between cognitive and music skills. In addition, the TD and WS groups differed in their patterns of pitch-related music skill development. These results suggest that the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS is atypical. Our findings stand in contrast with the views that claim innate modularity for music in WS; rather, they are consistent with neuroconstructivist accounts.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectMozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectMozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectMusic Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectWe examined effects of more vs. less time in kindergarten general music.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with stronger executive functions.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with more positive attitudes about self and school.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIndividuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectIndividuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirect12 males with major depression (MDD) completed measures of anhedonia and depression.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectAlso underwent fMRI whilst listening to preferred classical music.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectMDD group showed less activation of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) than healthy controls.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectMDD group showed attenuation of NAcc response in later compared to earlier times.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectSupports theories that MDD involves inability to sustain reward network activation.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectWe investigated the ability of preferred classical music to activate the nucleus accumbens in patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve males with MDD and 10 never mentally ill male healthy controls (HC) completed measures of anhedonia and depression severity, and listened to 90-second segments of preferred classical music during fMRI. Compared to HCs, individuals with MDD showed less activation of the left nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Individuals with MDD showed attenuation of the left NAcc response in later compared to earlier parts of the experiment, supporting theories that MDD involves an inability to sustain reward network activation. Counter intuitively, we found that NAcc activity during early music listening was associated with greater depression severity. In whole-brain analyses, anhedonia scores predicted activity in regions within the default mode network, supporting previous findings. Our results support theories that MDD involves an inability to sustain reward network activation. It also highlights that pleasant classical music can engage critical neural reward circuitry in MDD.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectMicrosaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectWe applied an attentional definition for state absorption.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectMicrosaccade rates are known to be linked to attentional processing and cognitive load.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectHere we show that microsaccade rate is also linked to state absorption during intense music listening.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectResults indicate that absorption can be measured indirectly by cross-modal interactions using eye tracking.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectThe power of music is a literary topos, which can be attributed to intense and personally significant experiences, one of them being the state of absorption. Such phenomenal states are difficult to grasp objectively. We investigated the state of musical absorption by using eye tracking. We utilized a load related definition of state absorption: multimodal resources are committed to create a unified representation of music. Resource allocation was measured indirectly by microsaccade rate, known to indicate cognitive processing load. We showed in Exp. 1 that microsaccade rate also indicates state absorption. Hence, there is cross-modal coupling between an auditory aesthetic experience and fixational eye movements. When removing the fixational stimulus in Exp. 2, saccades are no longer generated upon visual input and the cross-modal coupling disappeared. Results are interpreted in favor of the load hypothesis of microsaccade rate and against the assumption of general slowing by state absorption.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectMusic performance anxiety and perfectionism affect adult musicians.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe study examined the development of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age children.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThere was a strong correlations between music performance anxiety and perfectionism between ages 10 and 17.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectLevels of music performance anxiety and perfectionism increase with years of experience.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures?

Across three experiments, we find that vocal music leads to poorer cognitive and attitudinal outcomes for consumers lower in working memory capacity but does not affect those higher in working memory capacity. However, short-term habituation to background music helps mitigate this negative effect of vocal music on consumer ad recall. Finally, consumer performances on computing discount prices are also affected by music type depending upon whether prices are communicated in verbal or numeric form. Overall, this research lays out an executive-attention based process mechanism explaining when and how background music shapes consumer learning and memory. The outlined theory enriches the literature on music effects as well as immediate-term learning by explicating the role of selective attention in the processing of multi-modal marketing stimuli.Role of executive attention in consumer learning with background music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Brain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectBrain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectGuided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMusic and imagery was used for management of PTSD symptoms in women who had experienced Military Sexual Trauma.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectParticipants used music to regulate emotions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectImagery was a learned resource for grounding.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectEffects carried over between sessions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectThree out of four participants scored clinically significant reductions and one out of four scored a reliable reduction of PTSD symptoms.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMilitary Sexual Trauma (MST) is an issue among returning veterans that causes a significant amount of distress with a high occurrence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

The present study investigated the performance of skilled musicians on cognitively demanding sustained attention tasks, measuring both temporal and visual discrimination over a prolonged duration. Participants with extensive formal music training were found to have superior performance on a temporal discrimination task, but not a visual discrimination task, compared to participants with no music training. In addition, no differences were found between groups in vigilance decrement in either type of task. Although no differences were evident in vigilance per se, the results indicate that performance in an attention-demanding temporal discrimination task was superior in individuals with extensive music training. We speculate that this basic cognitive ability may contribute to advantages that musicians show in other cognitive measures.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectAddress: 3026 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, United States.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectNeural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectPianists imitated or listened to chord sequences with harmonic violations in fMRI.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectfMRI and rfMRI-connectivity showed dorsal motor and ventral audio streams for music.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectRight IFG is likely to integrate harmonic information in motor and audio format.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectParietal/temporal areas may be tied to motoric and auditory knowledge of harmony.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectThe ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tracting the neural basis of music: Deficient structural connectivity underlying acquired amusia - ScienceDirectAcquired amusia provides a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental neural architectures of musical processing due to the transition from a functioning to defective music processing system. Yet, the white matter (WM) deficits in amusia remain systematically unexplored. To evaluate which WM structures form the neural basis for acquired amusia and its recovery, we studied 42 stroke patients longitudinally at acute, 3-month, and 6-month post-stroke stages using DTI [tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and deterministic tractography (DT)] and the Scale and Rhythm subtests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA). Non-recovered amusia was associated with structural damage and subsequent degeneration in multiple WM tracts including the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and frontal aslant tract (FAT), as well as in the corpus callosum (CC) and its posterior part (tapetum). In a linear regression analysis, the volume of the right IFOF was the main predictor of MBEA performance across time. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the large-scale deficits in intra- and interhemispheric structural connectivity underlying amusia, and conversely highlight which pathways are crucial for normal music perception.Tracting the neural basis of music: Deficient structural connectivity underlying acquired amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectThe appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectSad music is listened to more commonly in sad moods and negative situations.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectMotivations for listening to sad music include validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectListening to sad music might be particularly helpful when people are experiencing negative life events.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectListening to sad music may be more adaptive for psychologically healthy people who are also more like to apply healthy coping strategies.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectDepressed individuals and ruminators use sad music both adaptively and maladaptive.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectAfter happiness, sadness is the most common emotion attributed to music. A recent proliferation of research has provided intense focus on the reasons why sad music is so popular. The research presented in this paper aims to summarize the results of recent studies. The findings indicate that many people report that they choose to listen to sad music when experiencing sadness, and after experiencing negative events. A range of motivations have been found as to why people choose to listen to sad music, these include the role of music in; validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation. For people who listen to sad music as an adaptive way to cope, some evidence in this review indicates that this may be a healthy strategy more applicable for psychologically healthy people, rather than those who are depressed or anxious. Findings indicate that depressed individuals, and ruminators, can use sad music adaptively, but also maladaptively. Sad music has also been shown to provide support when people are experiencing negative life events, as it enables the expression, identification, and understanding of the situation, which in turn aids the experience of consolation, and, ultimately, acceptance coping. Future directions for research, and the potential uses of sad music listening in therapeutic settings are discussed.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectMusic therapy is one of the types of active ageing programmes which are offered to elderly people.

For the perception of such structures, the detection of each boundary is crucial. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we explore the perception of hierarchical boundaries in music, and test whether musical expertise modifies such processing. Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Critical Thinking and Music Education - ScienceDirectCritical Thinking and Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and/or peer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectPast research has demonstrated that music often negatively impacts performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, including academically relevant tasks. There are, however, discrepancies in the literature, including a handful of instances where no effect of music was observed. We tested the novel hypothesis that working-memory capacity moderated the detrimental effect of music on academic performance. Undergraduate students worked on reading-comprehension and math tasks under both music and silence conditions before completing a battery of working-memory capacity assessments. Although music led to a significant decline in performance overall, working-memory capacity moderated this effect in the reading-comprehension tasks. These findings suggest that individuals who are better able to control their attention (as indexed by working-memory capacity) may be protected from music-related distraction when completing certain kinds of academically relevant tasks.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectAuthor NoteGenetic algorithms for music variation on genom platform - ScienceDirectThis paper considers the problems of algorithmic music variations and modeling of musical creativity in general with a help of genetic algorithms.

The cause of this is probably that neurosurgery had not been developed yet in the first half of the 20th century. In the past 3 decades, the neurosurgical operations of musicians show that musicians have rich associations among auditory, somatic, and sensorial systems.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectIt is clear that we have much to learn from studies about music and brain function that derive from our surgical experiences with patients. The neuronal plasticity of musicians' brains may be different from that of nonmusicians' brains. Musicians with enhanced motor skills have greater capacity for plasticity because of enriched interhemispheric connections. Listening to music and the effect of Mozart in neurosurgical practice, intensive care, or rehabilitation were documented in many studies. As authors, we mean something different: Its effectiveness should be studied. We concluded that in current neurosurgical practice, Mozart has an effect.

Three different approaches were taken. The first approach was a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of 18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identified style characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two reference pitches, the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations (for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, T. (1997). Self-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer). One model was trained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral experiment including the correct continuation tone, while another was trained with a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The convergence of the three approaches showed that both listeners and the SOM model are influenced by the statistical distributions of tones and tone sequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided evidence supporting a core set of psychological principles underlying melody formation whose relative weights appear to differ across musical styles.Cross-cultural music cognition: cognitive methodology applied to North Sami yoiks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music (e.g., Chinese, Indian) increased the recall of menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music increased the likelihood of choosing menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectClassical music increased willingness to pay for products related to social identity.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCountry music increased willingness to pay for utilitarian products.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic congruity effects on consumer behavior are conceptualized in terms of cognitive priming of semantic networks in memory, and operationalized as congruent with a product's country of origin (Experiment 1), or congruent with the utilitarian (Experiment 2) or social identity (Experiments 2 and 3) connotations of a product. Hearing a specific genre of music (e.g., classical) activates related concepts in memory (e.g., expensive, sophisticated, formal, educated), which influences the memory for, perception of, and choice of products. Consistent with this account of music congruity effects, three laboratory experiments show that playing music of a specific genre during initial product exposure improved subsequent recall of conceptually related (i.e., congruent) products compared to unrelated products (Experiment 1), affected product choice in favor of congruent products (Experiment 1), and affected how much participants were willing to pay for congruent products (Experiments 2 and 3).Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 7867.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 9279.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectBrain signals are recorded using EEG headset while listening to audio music.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectFour different emotions are recognized using hybrid features of EEG signals.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectEmotion recognition accuracy is analyzed for three different age groups.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectThe relationship between music genres and human emotions is examined.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (354KB)Download full-size imageHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectMusic streaming systems that are useful and provide enjoyment lead to adoption.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectSystems that are useful and provide enjoyment reduce digital piracy.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of creativity facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of community facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectPreventing unauthorized downloading and other forms of digital piracy has been a persistent challenge.

The rising popularity of music streaming systems, however, affords the owners of digital content opportunities to experiment with alternative business models and value propositions that may also discourage digital piracy. The results of this field study involving 139 subjects suggest that music streaming systems that incorporate features that facilitate individual creativity and community building contributes towards the enjoyment and usefulness of the system. This in turn leads to music streaming adoption. The results of the study also show that the usefulness of a music streaming system is associated with a reduction in pirating intention. Surprisingly, a link between the enjoyment of a music streaming system and a reduction in digital pirating intention was not supported.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (137KB)Download full-size imageThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectAn e-learning collaborative environment for music composing was examined.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectWe used assessment thorough video analysis and a semi-structured interview.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe technological context reshaped thinking and collaborative strategies.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCollaboration, identity and meta-cognition were critical.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe participants demonstrated awareness of the potentialities of the online tools.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectMusic and academic performance - ScienceDirectStudents who select music courses have better grades than the others in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCognitive mechanisms related to overcoming cognitive dissonances are discussed.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectEnjoyment of music might cause academic improvement.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectIn a previous study we demonstrated that listening to a pleasant music while performing an academic test helped students to overcome stress, to devote more time to more stressful and more complicated task and the grades were higher. Yet, there remained ambiguities as for the causes of the higher test performance of these students: do they perform better because they hear music during their examinations, or would they perform better anyway because they are more gifted/motivated? This motivated the current study as a preliminary step toward that general question: Do students who like/perform music have better grades than the others? Our results confirmed this hypothesis: students studying music have better grades in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing - ScienceDirectMusic notation and English word reading both involve mapping horizontally arranged visual components to components in sound, in contrast to reading in logographic languages such as Chinese. Accordingly, music-reading expertise may influence English word processing more than Chinese character processing. Here we showed that musicians named English words significantly faster than non-musicians when words were presented in the left visual field/right hemisphere (RH) or the center position, suggesting an advantage of RH processing due to music reading experience. This effect was not observed in Chinese character naming. A follow-up ERP study showed that in a sequential matching task, musicians had reduced RH N170 responses to English non-words under the processing of musical segments as compared with non-musicians, suggesting a shared visual processing mechanism in the RH between music notation and English non-word reading. This shared mechanism may be related to the letter-by-letter, serial visual processing that characterizes RH English word recognition (e.g., Lavidor & Ellis, 2001), which may consequently facilitate English word processing in the RH in musicians. Thus, music reading experience may have differential influences on the processing of different languages, depending on their similarities in the cognitive processes involved.Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectMelody similarity in music is a perception of listeners based on cognitive method. Thus, the algorithms should be based on perceptually oriented computational model. We have used computer generated synthesized tune of popular song and its variations to understand similarity notion. We have generated variations of a tune by changing musical scale or relative duration of notes or notes itself and combination of them. The proposed approach to calculate similarity relationship between two tunes will be useful to model the melody similarity notion for various applications such as QBH (Query by humming), music classification and retrieval, music plagiarism etc.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of International Conference on Advanced Computing Technologies and Applications (ICACTA-2015).Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectListening to happy music affected functional cerebral asymmetries.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectLeft hemispheric functioning was particularly sensitive to music listening.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in laterality were not mediated by changes in mood.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectTempo manipulation of the musical excerpt did not modulate the laterality effect.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectAdults with schizophrenia are less discriminative for harmonic changes in music, therefore, the perceptual and cognitive processing of understanding and responding to music may not be the same as that of healthy adults.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectSP group showed less sensitivity to the increased level of harmonic complexity within the music, suggesting that their evaluation of music complexity was not coherent.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectNo significant differences were found between groups in terms of their interest in and preference for harmonic progression in music.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe use of harmonic progression for adults with schizophrenia can be effectively considered in music selection.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectMusic therapists should incorporate an appropriate level of harmonic complexity in the music when used in mental health settings.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe first two authors are co-first authors and contributed equally to this work.Realising the potential of art-based interventions in managerial learning: Embodied cognition as an explanatory theory - ScienceDirectTeachers and consultants increasingly use art-based interventions (ABIs) to facilitate manager learning. However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which ABIs produce learning outcomes of value to organizations. This theoretical paper addresses this concern by revisiting the philosophy of art and education in light of developments in neuroscience known as embodied cognition. Specifically, we examine the role played by simulations in behavioral change and the way in which ABIs can foster the creation of simulations. This leads to two propositions, a) representing a phenomenon through new simulations can create new possibilities for interacting with this phenomenon; and b) making art is a means by which managers can construct new simulations. The significance of these propositions is illustrated by re-interpreting three accounts of art-based interventions found in the literature. These propositions have important implications for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ABIs in management education. In particular, they emphasize the need to match art medium with desired outcomes, provide support for the view that ABIs are well suited to learning about complex managerial challenges, and question the effectiveness of verbal reflection as part of ABIs.Realising the potential of art-based interventions in managerial learning: Embodied cognition as an explanatory theory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mentalising music in frontotemporal dementia - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectTen untrained subjects listened to 3 culturally different styles of music stimuli.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were measured and global and local network properties compared.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectLight music and western classical music perception manifested small world properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectChinese and western classical music perception showed right lateralization.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectFurther research is needed to understand network properties of music perception.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectGraph theoretical analysis has recently become a popular research tool in neuroscience, however, there have been very few studies on brain responses to music perception, especially when culturally different styles of music are involved.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music. For event-related potentials, phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and then constructed into correlation matrices. Clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths were evaluated for global properties, while clustering coefficients and efficiency were assessed for local network properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectPerception of light music and western classical music manifested small-world network properties, especially with a relatively low proportion of weights of correlation matrices.

The aim of this prospective study was to verify the efficacy of a Non-Instrumental Musical Training (NIMT) on the Numerical Cognition systems in children with low achievement in math. For this purpose, we examined, with a cluster analysis, whether children with low scores on Numerical Cognition would be grouped in the same cluster at pre and post-NIMT. Participants were primary school children divided into two groups according to their scores on an Arithmetic test. Results with a specialized battery of Numerical Cognition revealed improvements for Cluster 2 (children with low achievement in math) especially for number production capacity compared to normative data. Besides, the number of children with low scores in Numerical Cognition decreased at post-NIMT. These findings suggest that NIMT enhances Numerical Cognition and seems to be a useful tool for rehabilitation of children with low achievement in math.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well. However, studies in recent decades reported a lack of satisfaction in music perception with cochlear implants. This article reviews the literature on music ability of cochlear implant users by presenting a systematic outline of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant recipients with regard to their music perception as well as production. The review also evaluates the similarities and differences between electric hearing and acoustic hearing regarding music perception. We summarize the research results in terms of the individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and timbre). Finally, we briefly introduce the vocal singing of prelingually-deafened children with cochlear implants as evaluated by acoustic measures.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music has been tried in children with refractory encephalopathies.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMusic therapy decreased seizure recurrence in about 45% of children.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectAll responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in both adults and young patients.

The objective of the research is to document the experiences of music teachers in using locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study in south-eastern Estonian schools. As the main research problem, the question was posed: how and to what extent do teachers use their locality-related traditions in music lessons at the second stage of study? The research questions developed to solve the problem aimed to find out how music teachers define the concept of locality-related tradition and whether and how they utilize locality-related tradition in music lessons.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectLocal Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectMusic Spectrum: A Music Immersion Virtual Environment for Children with Autism - ScienceDirectVisual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectThis study looks into the visual perception of phrasing in a Tai Chi routine as affected by a change of music. The research aimed to investigate whether the quality of phrasing between music and movement is improved with a more congruent accompaniment. Sixty respondents, undergraduate music majors from two universities in Malaysia, were invited to participate in this study. They were asked to evaluate the phrasing between music and movement in videos of the same Tai Chi routine but with two different music accompaniments. It was found that there is a significant difference in the evaluation, and that the video with music composed to provide a better congruence in phrasing received a higher rating.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is characterized by verbal memory delays and a love of music.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWe examine if novel (unfamiliar) music can enhance verbal memory in WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThose with formal music training showed improved verbal memory.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectFormal music training may enhance educational outcomes for those with WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children performed better at auditory but not visual statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children also showed larger changes in online statistical learning ERPs.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in musical abilities are associated with capacity for statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe question whether musical training is associated with enhanced auditory and cognitive abilities in children is of considerable interest.

Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectA combination of acoustic and neurophysiological features are used to attempt to predict music-induced emotion.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectSignificant prediction results are achieved.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThese results are significantly better when a combination of features is used than either feature alone.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectFeatures selected include alpha and beta band powers and mel-cepstral coefficients.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectIt is widely acknowledged that music can communicate and induce a wide range of emotions in the listener. However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectCognition in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectAnalysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to find out the extent to which Slovenian general education teachers follow the principles of a balanced music objectives planning in the prevailing affective, psychomotor and cognitive domains.

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched.

It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectThe Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music. Similarly, RPE was higher in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition, but music had no effect. On the other hand, listening to music decreased the associative thoughts regardless of fatigue status. Heart rate was not influenced by any treatment.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectThese results suggest that listening to music changes attentional focus but is not able to reverse fatigue-derived alteration of performance.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectSemantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectWe used speech-to-song illusions to assess pitch perception in music and language.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectIllusions allowed us to hold acoustic characteristics constant for speech and song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectListeners were better at detecting musically unexpected pitch changes than expected.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectThis pattern was only evident when stimuli were perceived to transform to song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectPitch processing is influenced by domain-specific knowledge, not just acoustics.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFew studies comparing music and language processing have adequately controlled for low-level acoustical differences, making it unclear whether differences in music and language processing arise from domain-specific knowledge, acoustic characteristics, or both. We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectFree listening of music evokes ERPs similar to simplified stimuli.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectRapid changes in musical features of polyphonic music evoke N100 and P200 response.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectThe N100 and P200 responses are detected across different musical genres.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe study provides a detailed analysis of the music experiences of clients in treatment for alcohol and drug problems.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectClients of a hospital alcohol and drug service said that music listening intensified their emotional response to drug taking and vice versa.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectForty-three percent of the clients in residential rehabilitation identified a specific song or genre of music that cued an urge to use substances.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMechanisms linking music with cravings included associations with their previous substance use; music evoked emotions associated with previous substance use; and music contained lyrics concerning their primary substance.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectA majority of clients endorsed a view that music was important in their recovery from substance misuse.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMusic is commonly associated with substance use yet little is known about the music experiences of adults with substance use disorders. In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery.

It must react in realtime to audio signals from musicians, according to a timed high-level requirement called mixed score, written in a domain specific language. Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThis work has been partly supported by a DGA-MRIS scholarship and the project Inedit (ANR-12-CORD-009).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectDGA Direction Generale de l'Armement (French national defense).Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectPerceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectDavid E.

As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe show that respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectArgue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectIn spite of its importance as a life-defining rhythmic movement and its constant rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the body, respiration has not received attention in Embodied Cognition (EC) literature. Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBoth video games and music can increase physical excitement.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate a higher level than nonviolent video games.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThe excitement of background music interacts with game on aggression.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate more aggression regardless of pleasure level of music.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Matthias Rauterberg.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectEnhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectOutcomes showed the importance of early diagnosis of developmental dyscalculia to provide a satisfactory rehabilitation.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectMusical Training has a differential effect of Numerical Cognition comparing children with typical development and developmental dyscalculia.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectPerformance in Number Production increased after the Musical Training.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectStudies suggest that musical training enhances spatial-temporal reasoning and leads to greater learning of mathematical concepts. The aim of this prospective study was to verify the efficacy of a Non-Instrumental Musical Training (NIMT) on the Numerical Cognition systems in children with low achievement in math. For this purpose, we examined, with a cluster analysis, whether children with low scores on Numerical Cognition would be grouped in the same cluster at pre and post-NIMT. Participants were primary school children divided into two groups according to their scores on an Arithmetic test. Results with a specialized battery of Numerical Cognition revealed improvements for Cluster 2 (children with low achievement in math) especially for number production capacity compared to normative data. Besides, the number of children with low scores in Numerical Cognition decreased at post-NIMT. These findings suggest that NIMT enhances Numerical Cognition and seems to be a useful tool for rehabilitation of children with low achievement in math.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music during mechanical ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: A review - ScienceDirectMechanical ventilation (MV) causes many distressing symptoms. Weaning, the gradual decrease in ventilator assistance leading to termination of MV, increases respiratory effort, which may exacerbate symptoms and prolong MV. Music, a non-pharmacological intervention without side effects may benefit patients during weaning from mechanical ventilatory support. A narrative review of OVID Medline, PsychINFO, and CINAHL databases was conducted to examine the evidence for the use of music intervention in MV and MV weaning. Music intervention had a positive impact on ventilated patients; 16 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies were identified. Quantitative studies included randomized clinical trials (10), case controls (3), pilot studies (2) and a feasibility study. Evidence supports music as an effective intervention that can lesson symptoms related to MV and promote effective weaning. It has potential to reduce costs and increase patient satisfaction. However, more studies are needed to establish its use during MV weaning.The influence of music during mechanical ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well. However, studies in recent decades reported a lack of satisfaction in music perception with cochlear implants. This article reviews the literature on music ability of cochlear implant users by presenting a systematic outline of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant recipients with regard to their music perception as well as production. The review also evaluates the similarities and differences between electric hearing and acoustic hearing regarding music perception. We summarize the research results in terms of the individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and timbre). Finally, we briefly introduce the vocal singing of prelingually-deafened children with cochlear implants as evaluated by acoustic measures.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music has been tried in children with refractory encephalopathies.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMusic therapy decreased seizure recurrence in about 45% of children.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectAll responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in both adults and young patients.

Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentMusic Biology: All This Useful Beauty - ScienceDirectA systematic review on the effects of active participation in rhythm-centred music making on different aspects of health - ScienceDirectRhythm-centred music making (RMM) especially drumming and percussion music has been shown to be effective in promoting personal and interpersonal well-being. It is widely used both as a treatment as well as an adjunctive therapy for various conditions. Hence, we aimed to provide a systematic review of the current literature on the effects of active participation of RMM with a focus on drumming and percussion on an individual.

However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectCognition in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectThe development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectIn the field of psychology, the first studies in experimental aesthetics were conducted approximately 140 years ago. Since then, research has mainly concentrated on aesthetic responses to visual art. Both the aesthetic experience of music and, especially, its development have received rather limited attention. Moreover, until now, very little attention has been paid to the investigation of the aesthetic experience of music using neuroscientific methods. Aesthetic experiences are multidimensional and include inter alia sensory, perceptual, affective, and cognitive components. Aesthetic processes are usually experienced as pleasing and rewarding and are, thus, important and valuable experiences for many people. Because of their multidimensional nature, these processes employ several brain areas. In the present review, we examine important psychological and neural mechanisms that are believed to contribute to the development of aesthetic experiences of music. We also discuss relevant research findings. With the present review, we wish to provoke further discussion and possible future investigations as we consider the investigation of aesthetic experiences to be important both scientifically and with respect to potential clinical applications.The development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectThe development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to find out the extent to which Slovenian general education teachers follow the principles of a balanced music objectives planning in the prevailing affective, psychomotor and cognitive domains. The research sample involves 372 Slovenian student and current general education teachers who, working in pairs, prepared 186 lesson plans for music education. The research results showed that the majority of the musical objectives planned in this study, pertained to the psychomotor domain, followed by the cognitive objectives and by the least represented objectives of the affective domain.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectHumans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched.

It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectThe Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music. Similarly, RPE was higher in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition, but music had no effect.

Changes in hearing function are generally not a major focus of concern for persons with a majority of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). However, changes in the processing of sounds may be an early, and possibly preclinical, feature of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this chapter is to review the current state of knowledge concerning hearing and music perception in persons who have a dementia as a result of a neurodegenerative disease. The review focuses on both peripheral and central auditory processing in common neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on the processing of music and other non-verbal sounds. The chapter also reviews music interventions used for persons with neurodegenerative diseases.Hearing and music in dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectSemantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectWe used speech-to-song illusions to assess pitch perception in music and language.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectIllusions allowed us to hold acoustic characteristics constant for speech and song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectListeners were better at detecting musically unexpected pitch changes than expected.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectThis pattern was only evident when stimuli were perceived to transform to song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectPitch processing is influenced by domain-specific knowledge, not just acoustics.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFew studies comparing music and language processing have adequately controlled for low-level acoustical differences, making it unclear whether differences in music and language processing arise from domain-specific knowledge, acoustic characteristics, or both. We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectTreatment and prevention of music performance anxiety - ScienceDirectTreatment and prevention of music performance anxiety - ScienceDirectIn order to avoid severe MPA, prevention in the field of music pedagogic is very important.

In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery.

It must react in realtime to audio signals from musicians, according to a timed high-level requirement called mixed score, written in a domain specific language. Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThis work has been partly supported by a DGA-MRIS scholarship and the project Inedit (ANR-12-CORD-009).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectDGA Direction Generale de l'Armement (French national defense).Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectPerceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectDavid E.

Interview and observation results revealed that the subject had typical autistic communication impairments before the music education sessions. A single-case-single-site qualitative action research design was used to inquire into the verbal and non-verbal interactions, singing as well as the reading skills of the subject. Research findings through observations, video recording and interview with the class teacher revealed that the subject had obvious improvement in his verbal and non-verbal interactions as well as his reading and singing skills after intervention. Finally, recommendations for conducting music interventions were given.Communication Responses of an Indian Student with Autism to Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of JIBES University, Jakarta.Theoretical foundations and workable assumptions for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry - ScienceDirectThis article offers a theoretical foundation for cognitive behavioral music therapy in forensic psychiatry.

As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe show that respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectArgue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectIn spite of its importance as a life-defining rhythmic movement and its constant rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the body, respiration has not received attention in Embodied Cognition (EC) literature. Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBoth video games and music can increase physical excitement.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate a higher level than nonviolent video games.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThe excitement of background music interacts with game on aggression.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate more aggression regardless of pleasure level of music.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Matthias Rauterberg.Design of Music Syllabi in Estonian and Finnish National Core Curricula for Comprehensive Schools - ScienceDirectThe fundamental document directing the teacher's action in music teaching on the comprehensive level is the music syllabus in national core curriculum.

The proposed Automated Composition for Music Education (ACME) software was developed to help the students to compose the rhythm and melody themselves, while chord configuration and arrangement are automatically generated. Subsequently, sixth-year students of a non-experimental school were recruited to use the software for the completion of its development. Analysis of learning effectiveness at the reaction level, analysis of learning-level learning effectiveness, correlation analysis of the reaction- and learning-levels learning effectiveness has been performed with a significant result. The correlations between each component of learning effectiveness at the reaction and learning levels were also found. Finally the students in the experimental group using the ACME teaching materials showed a better learning effectiveness at both reaction level and learning level, than those of the students in the comparison group.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Content Assessment of Pre-School Education Program in Turkey Towards Music Education - ScienceDirectThe pre-school period when the brain is developed the most rapidly forms a strong ground for the cognitive, language, motor, social and emotional development of the child. Therefore, children grow very quickly especially in their first six years of life which is named as the pre-school period and in these development areas, they become complete in every respect with an amazing speed. Thus, this will result in having the child achieve his/her own potential and be a productive member of the society. Education is the head of the most effective processes in shaping, directing, changing and developing individuals and societies. Contemporary education is carried out by being organised within a framework which includes the three general subject areas named as science, art and technique. As for music education, it forms one of the most important branches of fine arts education as an education of art having vocalic and auditory qualities. It has a significant place within pre-school education. In this context, the pre-school education program lastly prepared in 2013 in Turkey was studied and a content assessment was made directed towards music education in this research.The Content Assessment of Pre-School Education Program in Turkey Towards Music Education - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectEffects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectEffects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectImprovement only on tasks that involved executive control.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectFew differences between effects of the two training programs.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectDemonstrates power of short training to modify cognitive performance.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectSeparate lines of research have identified enhanced performance on nonverbal executive control (EC) tasks for bilinguals and those with music training, but little is known about the relation between them in terms of the specificity of the effects of each experience or the degree of exposure necessary to induce these changes. Using an intervention design, the current study pseudorandomly assigned 57 4- to 6-year-old children (matched on age, maternal education, and cognitive scores) to a 20-day training program offering instruction in either music or conversational French. The test battery consisted of verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring EC. All children improved on these tasks following training with some training-specific differences. No changes were observed on background or working memory measures after either training, ruling out simple practice effects. Children in both groups had better scores on the most challenging condition of a grammaticality sentence judgment task in which it was necessary to ignore conflict introduced through misleading semantic content. Children in both training groups also showed better accuracy on the easier condition of a nonverbal visual search task at post-test, but children in the French training group also showed significant improvement on the more challenging condition of this task. These results are discussed in terms of emergent EC benefits of language and music training.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Non-verbal Communication in Music Lessons - ScienceDirectIn our study, which we carried out with a group of primary-school children aged between six and nine, we were interested in how musical language is shaped through group improvisations. Narrative dimensions of improvisation were studied through activities of Orff-Schulwerk, the specific music-movement education approach which, apart from music activities, puts great emphasis on development of social competences. The research was designed as a phenomenological case study. The findings show that, contrary to Orff-Schulwerk premises, children had yet to learn musical language and how to use it. It also turned out that teacher's expectations regarding the use of non-verbal communication are inversely proportional to the successful use of musical language. In line with Orff-Schulwerk's principles, rhythm proved to be the primary musical language parameter, as it was through rhythm that children first reached the sensations of others and reflectively depicted events from everyday life.Non-verbal Communication in Music Lessons - ScienceDirectPeer-Review Under Responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectInteracting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectInteracting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Giuseppe Riva.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectRethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectMusicality persists in dementia as documented in empirical and popular sources.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectDominant approaches to understanding this phenomenon emphasize cognition.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectEmbodiment as a potential source of agency has been neglected in discourse on music.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectA relational model of citizenship offers a critical perspective on musicality.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectThis underscores the ethical imperative to more fully support musicality in dementia.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectWith the biomedicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of dementia, music programs, as with other arts- and leisure-based programs, have primarily been implemented as non-pharmacological means to generate social and behavioural changes. We argue that understanding and fully supporting the musicality of persons living with dementia requires engagement with citizenship discourse. Specifically we draw on a model of relational citizenship that recognizes that corporeality is a fundamental source of self-expression, interdependence, and reciprocal engagement. We articulate this argument with reference to the musicality of two residents living with dementia in long-term residential care; one example is drawn from an ethnographic study of selfhood in dementia and the other is from a study of elder-clowning. Relational citizenship brings a new and critical dimension to the discourse on music, ageing, and the body in contemporary society.

We reasoned that consumer characteristics such as one's gender and Need for Cognition (NFC) can affect which meaning(s) of ad background music people use when forming product perceptions. Yet, are such meanings and their use unique to music, or could they extend to other forms of aesthetics? Two studies explore these issues, revealing parallel outcomes when background materials contain either music or graphic art designs: high (low) NFC males are sensitive to only referential (embodied) meaning, whereas females use both meanings.Gender differences in the meanings consumers infer from music and other aesthetic stimuli - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gender differences in the meanings consumers infer from music and other aesthetic stimuli - ScienceDirectEffect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to examine the effect of group music therapy on brain waves, behavior, and cognitive function among patients with chronic schizophrenia.Effect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectEffect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectEffect of the Group Music Therapy on Brain Wave, Behavior, and Cognitive Function among Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe group music therapy used in this study was an effective intervention for improving emotional relaxation, cognitive processing abilities along with positive behavioral changes in patients with chronic schizophrenia.

Accordingly, many models for mechanisms of timing implement rhythmic processes as the neural and cognitive substrate of time. In recent years, neuronal as well as cognitive exploration have revealed rhythmic motifs in the mechanisms governing attention and perception. In this review, we offer a taxonomy for different rhythmic motifs for cognition and explore the utility of this taxonomy in guiding the study of temporal processes.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThe Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectWe propose that the expressive power of human thought derives from a computational system we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectUGF is a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThe language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domainsThe Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThis view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectMany have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectReview of recent developments in mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI)Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectTheoretical background on embodied brain dynamicsImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectOverview on restrictions of established imaging methodsImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectSummary of hardware and software tools for MoBIImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectThis work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research to D.F.

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom.

Cognitive Intervention Program in collaboration with music therapy has been applied to 6 children that are in the experimental group. Other 6 children in the control group received only Cognitive Intervention Program, that was developed based on PASS theory. CAS test on two groups of children was performed after the interventions. The CAS total final test scores, suggests that experimental group resulted with significant difference from control group, p=, 002. Based on the findings of this study it can be suggested that interconnection of Music Therapy with Cognitive Intervention Program enables children with learning disability to be a step ahead in four problem areas, since intervention in these areas is twofold and can cover weaknesses of each other.The Impact of Cognitive Intervention Program and Music Therapy in Learning Disabilities - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Academic World Education and Research Center.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectThe most important function of the cerebellum may be to coordinate motor function so that movements can be performed smoothly, but there are others. It has been shown that the cerebellum is involved in certain aspects of cognition and changes in affect. Also verbal deficits can be found after cerebellar lesions.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectThe cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome is described, and the evidence for its existence discussed; in particular the use of neuroimaging studies. Different areas of the cerebellum have been identified as serving the various functions, and also their connections to the relevant parts of the cerebral cortex.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectCertain conditions merit special attention. The function of spatial navigation needs a major contribution from the cerebellum, and the problems of autism and impaired cognition are no doubt related to the enlarged cerebellum described in this disorder.

How does the brain produce creative thought? A series of recently published papers has begun to provide insight into this question, reporting a strikingly similar pattern of brain activity and connectivity across a range of creative tasks and domains, from divergent thinking to poetry composition to musical improvisation. This research suggests that creative thought involves dynamic interactions of large-scale brain systems, with the most compelling finding being that the default and executive control networks, which can show an antagonistic relation, tend to cooperate during creative cognition and artistic performance. These findings have implications for understanding how brain networks interact to support complex cognitive processes, particularly those involving goal-directed, self-generated thought.Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stay Creative! - Maintaining Individual Potential through Music Education - ScienceDirecthi contemporary education an interest on musical creativity and improvisation has steadily increased.

Across different cultures and eras they have been utilized for work, show, cultural rituals, consumption, therapy, and companionship and continue to serve in many of these roles today. As one of the most commonly trained domestic animals, understanding how horses learn and how their relationship with humans and other horses impacts their ability to learn has implications for horse welfare, training, husbandry and management. Given that unlike dogs and cats, domesticated horses have evolved from prey animals, the horse-human relationship poses interesting and unique scientific questions of theoretical value. There is still much to be learned about the cognition and behaviour of horses from a scientific perspective. This review explores current research within three related areas of horse cognition: human-horse interactions, social learning and independent learning in horses. Research on these topics is summarized and suggestions for future research are provided.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Time flies with music whatever its emotional valence - ScienceDirectTime flies with music whatever its emotional valence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectImpact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectModel the effects of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectGovernment policy affects environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectRevisit reason moderates the relationship between policy and visitor loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectRevisit reason moderates the relationship between policy and environment.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectOccupation type moderates the relationship between policy and environment.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectTourists' repeat patronage is a prerequisite for sustainable festivals. Past studies have examined tourist cognition, affection, and conation to festivals. Government involvement in festivals has increased during the past decade; however, few studies have examined how government policy and environment quality influence visitor loyalty to festivals. Using sample data collected from 931 visitors during spring music festivals held in Southern Taiwan, this study used a structural equation model (SEM) with latent variables to examine these influences. The results suggest that government policy positively influences perceived environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty to festivals. Furthermore, the results from a multigroup SEM approach reveal that tourists' revisit reason (revisit festival versus other) and occupation type (student versus nonstudent) moderate the relationships between government policy and festival loyalty. Implications on festival planning and government policymaking are discussed.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectYao-Kuei Lee is an associate professor in the Department of Marketing & Distribution Management at Tajen University, PingTung, Taiwan, ROC.

In this regard, the present study developed a WM test with nonverbal sounds and compared it to the conventional verbal WM test. A total of twenty-five, non-music major, right-handed college students were presented with four different types of sounds (words, syllables, pitches, timbres) that varied from two to eight digits in length. Both accuracy and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) were measured. The results showed significant effects of number of targets on accuracy and sound type on oxyHb. A further analysis showed prefrontal asymmetry with pitch being processed by the right hemisphere (RH) and timbre by the left hemisphere (LH). These findings suggest a potential for employing musical sounds (i.e., pitch and timbre) as a complementary stimuli for conventional nonverbal WM tests, which can additionally examine its asymmetrical roles in the prefrontal regions.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectEmotional preference of people from different ethnicity would alter multimedia implicit tagging remarkably. It can be speculated that the people from each ethnic group would prefer the folk music of their own ethnicity more than the others. An emotionally intelligent system based on electroencephalography (EEG) is proposed in this study to test this hypothesis. Four channels of EEG signals of 16 healthy subjects from different ethnic groups were recorded during 4 two-minute long excerpts of folk music. Six types of features extracted and a subset of them were selected based on minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The top-ranked features were fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with various similarity metrics. The performance of the proposed method was assessed in terms of F1-score and accuracy (ACC) using random sub-sampling cross validation scheme. The highest performance for the single SVM classifier was achieved by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based RBF kernel which was significantly higher than the chance level. These results approve that the tendency of people from each ethnic group to their ethnicity is significantly reflected in their EEG signals which can be automatically detected.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.We perceive music before we understand speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectTo conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current studies to determine whether music therapy affects the cognitive function of older people.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThe Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectMusic therapy intervention offered in nursing homes, hospitals, or communities.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThe Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectCognitive outcome domains were analyzed in a systematic review.

In both studies, the researchers conducted a series of active group music therapy interventions (lyric analysis, songwriting, music game, facilitated percussion interventions, and singalong) and passive group music listening sessions (recorded music via iPod) each for five days. During the first study, a higher percentage (15.53%) of patients on the unit attended the active music therapy sessions than the passive music listening sessions. Concerning treatment perceptions, participants in the active music therapy condition tended to have slightly higher mean perceptions of enjoyment and comfort than participants in the passive music listening condition. During the second study, participants spent more time in active music therapy sessions than in passive music listening sessions. Participants in the active music therapy condition also tended to have higher perceptions of helpfulness and amount learned concerning managing their mental illnesses than participants in the passive music listening condition. Results may have implications for funding psychiatric music therapy.

Much of spatial cognition research has focused on illuminating the domain-general processes (e.g. attention, memory, or representation) active in this domain-specific field. In this chapter, we suggest that researchers view this domain-general to domain-specific relationship in the opposite direction. In other words, we review spatial cognition research within the context of its utility for understanding domain-general processes. For a cognitive process to be domain-general, it should be evident across a wide variety of domain-specific tasks, including verbal and spatial ones. Yet, the majority of data supporting domain-general models comes from verbal tasks, such as list learning. Thus, we suggest that considering spatial cognition tasks and findings along with those from other domains would enhance our understanding of truly domain-general processing.The Cognition of Spatial Cognition: Domain-General within Domain-specific - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectWhile previous research has investigated the relationship either between language and music processing or between language and arithmetic processing, the present study investigated the relationship between music and arithmetic processing. Rule-governed number series, with the final number being a correct or incorrect series ending, were visually presented in synchrony with musical sequences, with the final chord functioning as the expected tonic or the less-expected subdominant chord (i.e., tonal function manipulation). Participants were asked to judge the correctness of the final number as quickly and accurately as possible. The results revealed an interaction between the processing of series ending and the processing of the task-irrelevant chords' tonal function, thus suggesting that music and arithmetic processing share cognitive resources. These findings are discussed in terms of general temporal and structural integration resources for linguistic and non-linguistic rule-governed sequences.Shared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectShared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Listening to the calls of the wild: The role of experience in linking language and cognition in young infants - ScienceDirectListening to the calls of the wild: The role of experience in linking language and cognition in young infants - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectAnalysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectA novel music/speech analysis framework via integration of audio content and functional brain response.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectBrain response features are derived from fMRI data when participants are listening to the music/speech.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectA novel regression algorithm named ITGP is proposed to improve the quality in predicting functional brain response.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectAnalysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Influence of Progressive Rock Music on Motivation Regarding Personal Goals, Motivation Regarding Competition and Level of Aspiration on Young Students in Psychology - ScienceDirectThe study is focused on highlighting the influence of progressive rock music on motivation regarding personal goals, motivation regarding competition and level of aspiration at young students in psychology.

Evidence from structural priming across music, math, action descriptions, and language - ScienceDirectCognitive processing in many domains (e.g., sentence comprehension, music listening, and math solving) requires sequential information to be organized into an integrational structure. There appears to be some overlap in integrational processing across domains, as shown by cross-domain interference effects when for example linguistic and musical stimuli are jointly presented (Koelsch, Gunter, Wittfoth, & Sammler, 2005; Slevc, Rosenberg, & Patel, 2009). These findings support theories of overlapping resources for integrational processing across domains (cfr. SSIRH Patel, 2003; SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). However, there are some limitations to the studies mentioned above, such as the frequent use of unnaturalistic integrational difficulties. In recent years, the idea has risen that evidence for domain-generality in structural processing might also be yielded though priming paradigms (cfr. Scheepers, 2003). The rationale behind this is that integrational processing across domains regularly requires the processing of dependencies across short or long distances in the sequence, involving respectively less or more syntactic working memory resources (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010), and such processing decisions might persist over time. However, whereas recent studies have shown suggestive priming of integrational structure between language and arithmetics (though often dependent on arithmetic performance, cfr. Scheepers et al., 2011; Scheepers & Sturt, 2014), it remains to be investigated to what extent we can also find evidence for priming in other domains, such as music and action (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). Experiment 1a showed structural priming from the processing of musical sequences onto the position in the sentence structure (early or late) to which a relative clause was attached in subsequent sentence completion. Importantly, Experiment 1b showed that a similar structural manipulation based on non-hierarchically ordered color sequences did not yield any priming effect, suggesting that the priming effect is not based on linear order, but integrational dependency. Finally, Experiment 2 presented primes in four domains (relative clause sentences, music, mathematics, and structured descriptions of actions), and consistently showed priming within and across domains. These findings provide clear evidence for domain-general structural processing mechanisms.Is there a domain-general cognitive structuring system?

Polyrhythms create tension between a counter meter and the main meter. Previously, we have shown that Brodmann area 47 (BA47), a brain area associated with processing of language, is activated bilaterally when musicians tap the main meter in a polymetric context emphasizing a counter meter, suggesting that processing of metric elements in music relies on brain areas also involved in language processing. In that study, the tension was created entirely by changes in the stimulus while participants were tapping the main meter. Here we find left-hemispheric BA47 activation in response to a self-produced counter meter on top of a main meter provided by an ecological music excerpt. This data indicates that the activation is linked to polyrhythmic tension, regardless of whether it arises from the stimulus or the task.Tapping polyrhythms in music activates language areas - ScienceDirectTapping polyrhythms in music activates language areas - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Memory structures for encoding and retrieving a piece of music: an ERP investigation - ScienceDirectMemory structures for encoding and retrieving a piece of music: an ERP investigation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dynamics of brain activity underlying working memory for music in a naturalistic condition - ScienceDirectDynamics of brain activity underlying working memory for music in a naturalistic condition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.How does background music tempo work for online shopping? - ScienceDirectHow does background music tempo work for online shopping? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Texture-Music Interaction in Sculpture Work - ScienceDirectNeural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectMusic is a multifaceted psychologic phenomenon, and separating the perceptual aspects of musical experiences from other aspects of those experiences is difficult, given music's propensity to trigger memories, movements, and emotions. Given that music is primarily an auditory phenomenon, it is reasonable to assume that the auditory cortex will play a major role in the representation of musical auditory scenes. The primary objective of this chapter was to survey the literature and perform a meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature in order to determine whether a delineation of the lateral temporal lobes emerges in terms of the processing of tonal, temporal, and timbral aspects of musical information. The meta-analysis revealed both overlapping and non-overlapping areas of auditory cortex, with a tendency for melodic and harmonic manipulations to activate areas outside the primary auditory cortex. Regions of the superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus rostral and ventral to the auditory cortex appear to play an important role in the perception of melodic intervals and patterns, and harmonies, but may not play a direct role in maintaining or evaluating higher-order tonal relationships that govern key membership or relationships between major and minor keys.Neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Learning music from collaboration - ScienceDirectI draw on two traditions of research: the social psychology of collaborative groups, and the ethnographic study of improvisational performance.

In addition, music processing in general is often considered spared by the neurodegenerative effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research examining these two phenomena is limited, and no work to our knowledge has explored the effectiveness of musical mnemonics in AD. The present study sought to investigate the effect of music at encoding on the subsequent recognition of associated verbal information. Lyrics of unfamiliar children's songs were presented bimodally at encoding, and visual stimuli were accompanied by either a sung or a spoken recording. Patients with AD demonstrated better recognition accuracy for the sung lyrics than the spoken lyrics, while healthy older adults showed no significant difference between the two conditions. We propose two possible explanations for these findings: first, that the brain areas subserving music processing may be preferentially spared by AD, allowing a more holistic encoding that facilitates recognition, and second, that music heightens arousal in patients with AD, allowing better attention and improved memory.Music as a memory enhancer in patients with Alzheimer's disease - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are left fronto-temporal brain areas a prerequisite for normal music-syntactic processing? - ScienceDirectAre left fronto-temporal brain areas a prerequisite for normal music-syntactic processing? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectThe vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectIn music, professionals cite sound as most important to performance evaluation.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectVisual information actually dominates the rapid judgment of group performance.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectParticipants are able to identify competition winners through silent videos.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectPredictions are no better than chance with sound or video plus sound recordings.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectPerformance judgment is driven by visual cues about group dynamics and leadership.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectTeam effectiveness and group performance are often defined by standards set by domain experts. Professional musicians consistently report that sound output is the most important standard for evaluating the quality of group performance in the domain of music. However, across six studies, visual information dominated rapid judgments of group performance. Participants (1062 experts and novices) were able to select the actual winners of live ensemble competitions and distinguish top-ranked orchestras from non-ranked orchestras based on 6-s silent video recordings yet were unable to do so from sound recordings or recordings with both video and sound. These findings suggest that judgments of group performance in the domain of music are driven at least in part by visual cues about group dynamics and leadership.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The rewards of music listening: Response and physiological connectivity of the mesolimbic system - ScienceDirectAlthough the neural underpinnings of music cognition have been widely studied in the last 5 years, relatively little is known about the neuroscience underlying emotional reactions that music induces in listeners. Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.The rewards of music listening: Response and physiological connectivity of the mesolimbic system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations.

The impact of affects, senses, and cognition - ScienceDirectThe experience of drinking beer can be explained based in a three dimensions: cognitive, affective, and sensory.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations. The impact of affects, senses, and cognition - ScienceDirectProduct experience is shaped by the interaction between the human systems and the product. Human systems include a sensory system to perceive the surrounding world, an affective system that evokes emotional responses to certain stimuli, and a cognitive system that makes meaning and processes information. We hypothesise that experience is a combination between these three systems rather than a linear continuum of hedonic reactions. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a study measuring the experience of drinking craft and industrial beers. A total of 400 consumers were invited to drink beer, rate their liking and select a set of phrases that better described their drinking experience. Results showed no significant difference in expected liking and purchase intention between the eight beers evaluated. However, a difference between beers was observed for the CATA phrases. Cognitive phrases were more frequently checked for craft beers, while sensory, and affective phrases were more frequently checked for industrial beers. A Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables showed that the sensory and cognitive systems were more related to liking than the affective system.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations.

We show how musical meaning emerges as both an abstract and locally situated, embodied discursive activity, in which speech is connected with metaphorical hand gestures and the material world. Multimodality of musical meaning involves not only abstract gesture and speech about musical ideas, but also implies the concrete use of material objects and actions, such as the instrument, the (breathing) body of the trumpet player, as well as reference to the musical score. Viewpoint is a central issue in this conceptual process: both teacher and student constantly put themselves in the shoes of the performer, simultaneously abstracting over and embodying both their own and the other's body-in-music as they perform and both verbally and gesturally address past and future trumpet playing.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectPaul Sambre is an assistant professor of discourse studies and Italian linguistics at the University of Leuven.

Wellness in part includes an individual's positive attitude towards, and active engagement in the health environment in which they function. A focus of wellness can include techniques and methods that people can use in their lives to combat stress and facilitate relaxation. Music as a sound medium has been used as part of wellness programs in a variety of ways, including as a sonic background for relaxation experiences. In this article, the role of music listening to positively affect neurophysiological and emotional responses related to relaxation is examined. Neurological bases of music listening and sound processing are reviewed, with emphasis on how music is processed by the limbic and related biological systems, including endocrine and hormonal responses. Suggestions for how consumers may use music listening in their own wellness and relaxation regimens are provided, including descriptions of which music to consider, where to obtain it, and how to use it.Music listening to facilitate relaxation and promote wellness: Integrated aspects of our neurophysiological responses to music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Mediating Effects of Positive Cognitions on Autism Caregivers' Depression and Their Children's Challenging Behaviors - ScienceDirectCaregivers of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are prone to depression and psychological problems, which have an impact on their children's challenging behaviors. Positive cognitions include specific positive thinking patterns that enhance one's ability to effectively manage daily activities and promote mental health. The purpose of this research is to test the mediating effects of positive cognitions on the relationship between caregivers' depression and their children's challenging behaviors among 117 caregivers of persons with ASD. Positive cognitions were found to have mediating effects on the relationship between caregiver's depression and their children's challenging behaviors in this sample of caregivers of persons with ASD. Nurses are in a strategic position to include in their interventions those strategies that strengthen positive cognitions in order to improve the caregivers' positive cognitions and well-being, which, in turn will have an impact on their children's challenging behaviors.The Mediating Effects of Positive Cognitions on Autism Caregivers' Depression and Their Children's Challenging Behaviors - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectA model of online consumer behavior incorporating emotions, cognitions, flow, entertainment, online attitudes and purchase intentions was developed and tested, as well as the moderating effects of need for cognition (NFC) and optimum stimulation level (OSL). Cognitions relate to website functional characteristics, while entertainment relates to its hedonic characteristics. Emotions encompass pleasure, arousal and dominance. Findings indicate that in the context of online visiting, emotions precede cognitions. Among other findings, the dimension of dominance played a major role in the model. The moderating effects of NFC and OSL on the model were tested individually as well as the interactive effects of these moderators. Strong main and interactive effects of NFC and OSL were found. Several key differential paths were identified. Finally, the article provides a description of website visitors based on these personality variables.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectAn Architectural Symphony: Fusing Disabilities with Music - ScienceDirectThis paper aims to uncover the creative music potentials of disabled youths in Malaysia.

Here, we investigate these neural mechanisms by applying a well-defined painful stimulus while participants listened to their favorite music or to no music. Neural responses in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord were mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging spanning the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Subjective pain ratings were observed to be significantly lower when pain was administered with music than without music. The pain stimulus without music elicited neural activity in brain regions that are consistent with previous studies. Brain regions associated with pleasurable music listening included limbic, frontal, and auditory regions, when comparing music to non-music pain conditions. In addition, regions demonstrated activity indicative of descending pain modulation when contrasting the 2 conditions. These regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, periaqueductal gray matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord. This is the first imaging study to characterize the neural response of pain and how pain is mitigated by music, and it provides new insights into the neural mechanism of music-induced analgesia within the central nervous system.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectThis article presents the first investigation of neural processes underlying music analgesia in human participants.

This harmonic priming effect occurs for fine syntactic-like changes in context and is observed irrespective of the extent of participants' musical expertise (Bigand & Pineau, Perception and Psychophysics, 59 (1997) 1098). The present study investigates how the harmonic context influences the processing of phonemes in vocal music. Eight-chord sequences were presented to participants. The four notes of each chord were played with synthetic phonemes and participants were required to quickly decide whether the last chord (the target) was sung on a syllable containing the phoneme /i/ or /u/. The musical relationship of the target chord to the previous context was manipulated so that the target chord acted as a referential tonic chord or as a congruent but less structurally important subdominant chord. Phoneme monitoring was faster for the tonic chord than for the subdominant chord. This finding has several implications for music cognition and speech perception. It also suggests that musical and phonemic processing interact at some stage of processing.The effect of harmonic context on phoneme monitoring in vocal music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music in dreams - ScienceDirectMusic in dreams is rarely reported in scientific literature, while the presence of musical themes in dreams of famous musicians is anecdotally reported. We did a systematic investigation to evaluate whether the occurrence of musical dreams could be related to musical competence and practice, and to explore specific features of dreamt pieces. Thirty-five professional musicians and thirty non-musicians filled out a questionnaire about the characteristics of their musical activity and a structured dream log on the awakening for 30 consecutive days. Musicians dream of music more than twice with respect to non-musicians; musical dreams frequency is related to the age of commencement of musical instruction, but not to the daily load of musical activity. Nearly half of the recalled music was non-standard, suggesting that original music can be created in dreams.Music in dreams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectAlthough a substantial number of research projects have addressed music information retrieval over the past three decades, the field is still very immature. Few of these projects involve complex (polyphonic) music; methods for evaluation are at a very primitive stage of development; none of the projects tackles the problem of realistically large-scale databases. Many problems to be faced are due to the nature of music itself. Among these are issues in human perception and cognition of music, especially as they concern the recognizability of a musical phrase. This paper considers some of the most fundamental problems in music information retrieval, challenging the common assumption that searching on pitch (or pitch-contour) alone is likely to be satisfactory for all purposes. This assumption may indeed be true for most monophonic (single-voice) music, but it is certainly inadequate for polyphonic (multi-voice) music. Even in the monophonic case it can lead to misleading results. The fact, long recognized in projects involving monophonic music, that a recognizable passage is usually not identical with the search pattern means that approximate matching is almost always necessary, yet this too is severely complicated by the demands of polyphonic music. Almost all text-IR methods rely on identifying approximate units of meaning, that is, words. A fundamental problem in music IR is that locating such units is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectThis material is based on work supported in part by the Digital Libraries Initiative, Phase 2, under NSF grant IIS-9905842, by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee under project code JCDE/NSFKCL, and by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC-9209623.

In order to investigate how these different facets of perfectionism are related to coping, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in musicians, we asked 275 professional and amateur Japanese musicians to complete measures of perfectionism traits, perfectionism cognitions, coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. While both facets of perfectionism showed a similar pattern of correlation with coping measures, they were differently associated with effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis showed the incremental validity of perfectionism cognitions in explaining variance in performance anxiety above the variance explained by other variables, such as trait perfectionism. These findings demonstrate that perfectionism in musicians has both positive and negative elements.Traits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians - ScienceDirectTraits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Moderating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectResting state networks (RSNs) are spontaneous, synchronous, low-frequency oscillations observed in the brains of subjects who are awake but at rest. A particular RSN called the default mode network (DMN) has been shown to exhibit changes associated with neurological disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have also found that differing experimental conditions such as eyes-open versus eyes-closed can produce measurable changes in the DMN. These condition-associated changes have the potential of confounding the measurements of changes in RSNs related to or caused by disease state(s). In this study, we use fMRI measurements of resting-state connectivity paired with EEG measurements of alpha rhythm and employ independent component analysis, undirected graphs of partial spectral coherence, and spatiotemporal regression to investigate the effect of music-listening on RSNs and the DMN in particular. We observed similar patterns of DMN connectivity in subjects who were listening to music compared with those who were not, with a trend toward a more introspective pattern of resting-state connectivity during music-listening. We conclude that music-listening is a valid condition under which the DMN can be studied.Moderating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectModerating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perinatal exposure to music protects spatial memory against callosal lesions - ScienceDirectSeveral studies have indicated that the exposure of rodents to music modulates brain development and neuroplasticity, by mechanisms that involve facilitated hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotrophin synthesis and glutamatergic signaling. This study focused on the potential protection that the perinatal exposure to music, between postnatal days 2 and 32, could offer against functional deficits induced by neonatal callosotomy in rats. The spontaneous alternation and marble-burying behaviors were longitudinally measured in callosotomized and control rats that had been exposed to music or not. The results indicated that the neonatal callosotomy-induced spontaneous alternation deficits that became apparent only after postnatal day 45, about the time when the rat corpus callosum reaches its maximal levels of myelination. The perinatal exposure to music efficiently protected the spontaneous alternation performance against the deficits induced by callosotomy. The present findings may offer important insights into music-induced neuroplasticity, relevant to brain development and neurorehabilitation.Perinatal exposure to music protects spatial memory against callosal lesions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical structure modulates semantic priming in vocal music - ScienceDirectMusical structure modulates semantic priming in vocal music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats - ScienceDirectDuring the prenatal period, the development of individual is influenced by the environmental factors. In the present study, the influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats was investigated. The exposure to the noise during pregnancy caused growth retardation, decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and impaired spatial learning ability in pups. The exposure to music during pregnancy, on the other hand, caused increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and enhanced spatial learning ability in pups.

Here we address the possibility that creative cognition is a function of dopaminergic modulation in fronto-striatal brain circuitries. It is proposed that (i) creative cognition benefits from both flexible and persistent processing, (ii) striatal dopamine and the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is associated with flexible processing, while (iii) prefrontal dopamine and the integrity of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway is associated with persistent processing. We examine this possibility in light of studies linking creative ideation, divergent thinking, and creative problem-solving to polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes, indirect markers and manipulations of the dopaminergic system, and clinical populations with dysregulated dopaminergic activity. Combined, studies suggest a functional differentiation between striatal and prefrontal dopamine: moderate (but not low or high) levels of striatal dopamine benefit creative cognition by facilitating flexible processes, and moderate (but not low or high) levels of prefrontal dopamine enable persistence-driven creativity.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectThis work was facilitated by a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-451-12-023) to Matthijs Baas.Effect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectEffect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectSupported by Sigma Theta Tau International Gamma Chapter and by a University of Iowa College of Nursing Research Grant Award.Music as a Therapeutic Intervention on an Inpatient Neuroscience Unit - ScienceDirectMusic as a Therapeutic Intervention on an Inpatient Neuroscience Unit - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectEnvironmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectMobile devices enable ubiquitous working in multiple, varying environments.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectExploring a virtual environment affects work performance.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectBeing in a work-related context leads to a more risky decision-making behaviour.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectBeing in a work-related context enhances efficiency in a concentration task.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectThe term ubiquitous working describes the relocation from working in a traditional office on company premises to flexible working in the home or in other environments that were never originally conceptualized for working, such as parks or hotel lobbies. Research indicates that the environment has the potential to influence work performance. We used virtual 3D environments to examine the impact of a work-related (characteristic office) vs. a non-work related context (Tuscan garden) on attention, concentration, and decision making. We assumed that the context would influence cognitive performance. Our results showed that, compared to the non-work context, participants in the work context (1) had marginally faster reaction times in an attentional task (2) were more accurate in completing a concentration test, and (3) made decisions that were more risky. These results suggest that working in a more typical work environment enhances work performance and influences decision making.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectRecent brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the human mirror system, in addition to becoming active while viewing the actions of others, also responds to abstract visual and auditory stimuli associated with specific actions.

Thus, music is a promising tool in the rehabilitation of aging-related neurological illnesses, such as stroke and Alzheimer disease. As the population ages and the incidence and prevalence of these illnesses rapidly increases, music-based interventions that are enjoyable and effective in the everyday care of the patients are needed. In addition to formal music therapy, musical leisure activities, such as music listening and singing, which patients can do on their own or with a caregiver, are a promising way to support psychological well-being during aging and in neurological rehabilitation. This review article provides an overview of current evidence on the cognitive, emotional, and neural effects of musical leisure activities both during normal aging and in the rehabilitation and care of stroke patients and people with dementia.Cognitive, emotional, and neural benefits of musical leisure activities in aging and neurological rehabilitation: A critical review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectDysfunctional cognitions can contribute to depression and its maintenance. They may be related to a higher relapse rate and a longer duration of the depressive episode. The relevance of dysfunctional cognitions for acute inpatient treatment of unipolar depression is examined in this study and its variability by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirect222 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were evaluated during their inpatient treatment by assessing admission and discharge depression scores and their relationship to dysfunctional cognitions, using the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS). The relationship between dysfunctional cognitions and treatment outcome was examined. Primary outcome measures were the Hamilton-Rating-Scale (HRSD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectDysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectDysfunctional cognitions are relatively stable compared to other depressive symptoms and are associated with poorer treatment outcome even in combined treatment of antidepressant medication and CBT during inpatient treatment. Changes of dysfunctional cognitions seem to be a long-term treatment goal, especially because of their association with comorbid personality disorders and recurrent depressive disorders.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectAll authors contributed to and have approved the final manuscript.Walking on music - ScienceDirectWalking on music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectPitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectWe examined how pitch expertise via music or language impact sound discrimination.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectWe measured neural and behavioural correlates of pitch and timbre discrimination.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectMusicians showed enhanced pitch and timbre discrimination in both brain and behaviour.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectPitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectMusicianship benefits auditory processing more than than tone-language experience.Pitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectPitch expertise is not created equal: Cross-domain effects of musicianship and tone language experience on neural and behavioural discrimination of speech and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neural mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music: An fMRI study - ScienceDirectNumerous music cultures use nonsense syllables to represent percussive sounds. Covert reciting of these syllable sequences along with percussion music aids active listeners in keeping track of music. Owing to the acoustic dissimilarity between the representative syllables and the referent percussive sounds, associative learning is necessary for the oral representation of percussion music. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural processes underlying oral rehearsals of music. There were four music conditions in the experiment: (1) passive listening to unlearned percussion music, (2) active listening to learned percussion music, (3) active listening to the syllable representation of (2), and (4) active listening to learned melodic music. Our results specified two neural substrates of the association mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music. First, information integration of heard sounds and the auditory consequences of subvocal rehearsals may engage the right planum temporale during active listening to percussion music. Second, mapping heard sounds to articulatory and laryngeal gestures may engage the left middle premotor cortex.Neural mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music: An fMRI study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectExperience has shown that therapy using music for therapeutic purposes has certain effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (both functional and organic disorders). However, the mechanisms of action underlying music therapy remain unknown, and scientific clarification has not advanced.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectWhile that study disproved the Mozart effect, the effects of music on the human body and mind were not disproved. In fact, more scientific studies on music have been conducted in recent years, mainly in the field of neuroscience, and the level of interest among researchers is increasing. The results of past studies have clarified that music influences and affects cranial nerves in humans from fetus to adult. The effects of music at a cellular level have not been clarified, and the mechanisms of action for the effects of music on the brain have not been elucidated.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectWe propose that listening to music facilitates the neurogenesis, the regeneration and repair of cerebral nerves by adjusting the secretion of steroid hormones, ultimately leading to cerebral plasticity. Music affects levels of such steroids as cortisol (C), testosterone (T) and estrogen (E), and we believe that music also affects the receptor genes related to these substances, and related proteins.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectMusic facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual differences in music performance - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in music performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceiving temporal regularity in music - ScienceDirectPerceiving temporal regularity in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceiving speech rhythm in music: Listeners classify instrumental songs according to language of origin - ScienceDirectPerceiving speech rhythm in music: Listeners classify instrumental songs according to language of origin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recognizing group cognition - ScienceDirectRecognizing group cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Joint music making promotes prosocial behavior in 4-year-old children - ScienceDirectJoint music making promotes prosocial behavior in 4-year-old children - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Joint music making promotes prosocial behavior in 4-year-old children - ScienceDirectAuthor contributions: S.

In this chapter, selected examples from famous and unknown organ players/composers are presented to demonstrate the complexity of modified musical performances as well as the capacities of the brain to preserve artistic abilities: both authors are active organists and academic neurologists with strong clinical experience, practice, and knowledge about the challenges to play such an outstanding instrument and share their interest to explore potentially instrument-related phenomena of brain modulation in specific transient or permanent impairments. We concentrate on the sites of lesions, suggested pathophysiology, separate positive (e.g., seizures, visual or auditory hallucinations, or synesthesia [an involuntary perception produced by stimulation of another sense]) and negative phenomena (e.g., amusia, aphasia, neglect, or sensory-motor deficits) and particularly address aspects of recent concepts of temporary and permanent network disorders.Organists and organ music composers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Attending to music decreases inattentional blindness - ScienceDirectAttending to music decreases inattentional blindness - ScienceDirectAttending to music decreases inattentional blindness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectAlthough simple home-based mind-body therapies such as meditation and music listening may hold promise for improving outcomes this population, studies are lacking.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectIn this feasibility study of community-dwelling older adults with SCD, enrollment was robust, retention and compliance in both groups were excellent, and satisfaction with both programs was high.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectThese findings suggest that these simple home-based mind-body therapies were well-accepted and the practices are feasible for older adults experiencing early memory loss.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectIn this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of two simple home-based relaxation programs in adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline, a strong predictor of Alzheimer's disease.A randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial of two simple mind-body programs, Kirtan Kriya meditation and music listening, for adults with subjective cognitive decline: Feasibility and acceptability - ScienceDirectFifty-three participants (88%) completed the 6 month study.

Functional neuroimaging and lesion studies show that music-evoked emotions can modulate activity in virtually all limbic and paralimbic brain structures. These structures are crucially involved in the initiation, generation, detection, maintenance, regulation and termination of emotions that have survival value for the individual and the species. Therefore, at least some music-evoked emotions involve the very core of evolutionarily adaptive neuroaffective mechanisms. Because dysfunctions in these structures are related to emotional disorders, a better understanding of music-evoked emotions and their neural correlates can lead to a more systematic and effective use of music in therapy.Towards a neural basis of music-evoked emotions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Elements of Mental Training in Music - ScienceDirectMental training typically takes place without an instrument or the physical act of playing, and focuses on a particular activity, a conscious guiding of that activity, as well as on incorporating an emotional experience of that activity. Previous research (Immonen, 2007) showed that both modes of practicing, mental as well as physical, involve three important elements: planning, realization, and evaluation of the practice. In music, mental training aims at the most ideally possible act of playing and the creation of a musical event. The research problem is to find out the pianist carries out the mental training. The research data was collected through the interviews of four highly talented pianists of the Sibelius Academy.Music to my eyes: Cross-modal interactions in the perception of emotions in musical performance - ScienceDirectMusic to my eyes: Cross-modal interactions in the perception of emotions in musical performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Brain on music kills pain of workouts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of activity engagement in the relations between Openness/Intellect and cognition - ScienceDirectThe role of activity engagement in the relations between Openness/Intellect and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The structural neuroanatomy of music emotion recognition: Evidence from frontotemporal lobar degeneration - ScienceDirectDespite growing clinical and neurobiological interest in the brain mechanisms that process emotion in music, these mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) frequently exhibit clinical syndromes that illustrate the effects of breakdown in emotional and social functioning. Here we investigated the neuroanatomical substrate for recognition of musical emotion in a cohort of 26 patients with FTLD (16 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, bvFTD, 10 with semantic dementia, SemD) using voxel-based morphometry. On neuropsychological evaluation, patients with FTLD showed deficient recognition of canonical emotions (happiness, sadness, anger and fear) from music as well as faces and voices compared with healthy control subjects. Impaired recognition of emotions from music was specifically associated with grey matter loss in a distributed cerebral network including insula, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal and more posterior temporal and parietal cortices, amygdala and the subcortical mesolimbic system. This network constitutes an essential brain substrate for recognition of musical emotion that overlaps with brain regions previously implicated in coding emotional value, behavioural context, conceptual knowledge and theory of mind. Musical emotion recognition may probe the interface of these processes, delineating a profile of brain damage that is essential for the abstraction of complex social emotions.The structural neuroanatomy of music emotion recognition: Evidence from frontotemporal lobar degeneration - ScienceDirectSource localization of the effects of Persian classical music forms on the brain waves by QEEG - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study is investigation of the effects of Persian classical music forms on the brain waves and areas. Main tool was QEEG that registers brain waves. Independent variables include four classical music forms: Pishdaramad, Chaharmezrab, Reng and Avaz that their effects have been investigated on the 12 right handed subjects. The results indicated significant differences in the effects of Pishdaramad form on the theta band while it could affect on different brain areas in comparison with other music forms including the increase of activity in Superior Frontal Gyrus and Precentral Gyrus areas in comparison with noise and Avaz and decrease of activity on Postcentral Gyrus and Supramarginal Gyrus areas in comparison with Chaharmezrab and Reng. The results concluded from rhythmic changes in each of music forms. In other word the increase of rhythm speed can raise the brain activity. Also the results of this study shows important of frontal area during the processing of emotional music.Specific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectSpecific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectThis article presents a randomized placebo-controlled trial on music therapy in the treatment of adolescents with frequent primary headache.

One distinctive characteristic for each group is theoretically hypothesized within the cognitive dissonance framework and empirically confirmed for both movie and music downloading: A more negative attitude towards newness distinguishes downloaders who never pay, a shorter Internet use history distinguishes downloaders who always pay, and participation in a greater breadth of online activities distinguishes eclectic downloaders. By contrast, neither demographics nor factors related to movie (music) interests help explain the differences among the groups of movie (music) downloaders. Both the theoretical framework and the empirical evidence might be used to improve the effectiveness of anti-piracy campaigns by adapting their messages to the specific characteristics and expected reactions of each group of downloaders.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGenerality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectWe studied generalization of expertise to auditory perceptual and broader cognitive skills.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectMusician groups perceived auditory signal differences more finely than non-musicians.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectMusician groups differed in fine perception given a training-relevant context.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectMusical expertise did not strongly generalize to several cognitive measures (e.g., auditory scene analysis).Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectSustained attention predicted variance in fine perception of AM depth above expertise.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGenerality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectThe effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectThe authors gratefully acknowledge the suggestions and comments of two anonymous reviewers and the Special Issue Editor.Emotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectThis paper reviews the use of music as an adjuvant to the control of pain, especially in medical procedures. Surgery causes stress and anxiety that exacerbates the experience of pain. Self-report of and physiological measures on post-surgical patients indicate that music therapy or music stimulation reduces the perception of pain, both alone and when part of a multimodal pain management program, and can reduce the need for pharmaceutical interventions. However, multimodal pain therapy, including non-pharmacological interventions after surgery, is still rare in medical practice. We summarize how music can enhance medical therapies and can be used as an adjuvant with other pain-management programs to increase the effectiveness of those therapies. As summarized, we currently know that musical pieces chosen by the patient are commonly, but not always, more effective than pieces chosen by another person. Further research should focus both on finding the specific indications and contra-indications of music therapy and on the biological and neurological pathways responsible for those findings (related evidence has implicated brain opioid and oxytocin mechanisms in affective changes evoked by music). In turn, these findings will allow medical investigators and practitioners to design guidelines and reliable, standardized applications for this promising method of pain management in modern medicine.Emotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectEmotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Social Cognition in Individuals With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: Recent Advances and Trends in Research - ScienceDirectSocial Cognition in Individuals With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: Recent Advances and Trends in Research - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThe role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThis synthesis of current research characterizes the functional roles of the PHC.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectContextual associative processing is proposed as the core function of this region.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThis proposal unifies findings for the PHC, creating convergence for future research.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThe parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has been associated with many cognitive processes, including visuospatial processing and episodic memory. To characterize the role of PHC in cognition, a framework is required that unifies these disparate processes. An overarching account was proposed whereby the PHC is part of a network of brain regions that processes contextual associations. Contextual associations are the principal element underlying many higher-level cognitive processes, and thus are suitable for unifying the PHC literature. Recent findings are reviewed that provide support for the contextual associations account of PHC function. In addition to reconciling a vast breadth of literature, the synthesis presented expands the implications of the proposed account and gives rise to new and general questions about context and cognition.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectA variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectVariational analysis of brightness matching.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGives an overview on variational analysis.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectContext-driven judgements as an optimal balance between contrast and dispersion.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGeneralization of the variational framework to perceptual and cognitive phenomena.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectPossibility to derive new constraints for context-driven effects.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectStarting with a computational analysis of brightness matching, we develop a novel variational framework able to model perceptual context-driven effects that may be extended to non-physical judgments as well. The most important feature of the variational framework is the description of these phenomena as a suitable balance between contrast and dispersion. The optimal balance is defined through the simultaneous minimization of functionals characterized by two terms in opposition to each other. When the minimum is reached, the equilibrium between contrast and dispersion is attained. To show the flexibility of the proposed framework, we discuss several examples of such functionals in the field of color perception and cognition which show adherence between theoretical predictions and empirical results. With regard to social cognition theories, the simultaneous occurrence of contrast and dispersion conflicts with sequential models, thus supporting the idea of a concurrent presence of both effects in each judgment. The variational framework can serve as a view from above on perceptual and cognitive phenomena that may help in deriving new constraints for disambiguating alternative theories.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creativity, primordial cognition, and personality - ScienceDirectPotential creativity measured by the Alternate Uses Test, remoteness of word associations, and rated creativity of fantasy stories was found to be related to primordial content in the fantasy stories. Psychoticism and extraversion have been found to be related to creativity. There are theoretical reasons to think that they might also be related to use of primordial cognition. Potential creativity and primordial content were correlated with both extraversion and psychoticism. Potential creativity and primordial cognition were much more strongly related to extraversion than to psychoticism. The common trait binding these traits together may be disinhibition. Relationships among creativity, primordial cognition, and extraversion are much stronger among men than among women.Creativity, primordial cognition, and personality - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The more the better?

The current research demonstrated the widely reported Mozart Effect as only partly significant. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 16 professional classical and rock musicians during a standard 2 stimulus visual oddball task, while listening to classical and rock music. During the oddball task participants were required to discriminate between an infrequent target stimulus randomly embedded in a train of repetitive background or standard stimuli. Consistent with previous research, the P3 and N2 ERPs were elicited in response to the infrequent target stimuli. Own genre preference resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the P3 for classical musicians exposed to classical music and rock musicians exposed to rock music. Notably, at the pre-attentive stage of processing (N2) beneficial effects of exposure to classical music were observed for both groups of musicians. These data are discussed in terms of short and long-term music benefits on both conscious and unconscious cognitive processes.The effects of music exposure and own genre preference on conscious and unconscious cognitive processes: A pilot ERP study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.What do monkeys' music choices mean? - ScienceDirectMcDermott and Hauser have recently shown that although monkeys show some types of preferences for sound, preferences for music are found only in humans.

We enforced active music therapy (MT) individual session to patients with Rett syndrome. The patients were 4, 5 and 6-year-old. The active music therapy and individual session of 30 min/week were performed. It was recorded in video and description, and using the original evaluation list, six items of fact. On largest problem that is hand operation with purpose in childhood of Rett syndrome, we recorded the longest duration and frequency of hand grasping time in one session. There was the improvement of 35.0% of listening music, 33.3% play music, 13.3% singing music, 11.7% minute motion, 11.7% language, and 20.0% personal relation and sociality. The longest duration of hand grasping time was improved from 2 to 12 s in case 2 and from 7 to 80 s in case 3. Grasp frequency which showed the volition rapidly increased from 3 to 41 times, though the elongation for the duration of grasping was little for case 2. Rett syndrome is the disease in which the psychomotor performance regresses with the age, but the aspect that surely developed in the session could be evaluated. Rett syndrome has the ability understanding the music, and music therapy is suitable for them.Music therapy for children with Rett syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Environmental background music and in-store selling - ScienceDirectRetailers use background music in order to enhance the atmosphere of their stores. The present study shows, as predicted by the proposed model, that the effects of music on attitudes toward the store, the salesperson, and the visit to the store are moderated by cognitive processes (number of thoughts and depth of information processing), whereas previous studies focused on emotional moderators. Soothing music (i.e., both pleasant and low arousing) is shown, as predicted, to increase cognitive activity when other cognitive stimulation is low (mainly when sales arguments are weak). However, retailers are warned that enhancing cognitive activity is no panacea since it is found here that higher cognitive activity is associated with lower attitudes. It is proposed that music fit with the store may explain such results. Music fit and cognitive processed triggered by store music are strongly suggested as avenues of store atmospherics research.Environmental background music and in-store selling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Silent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectSilent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (149KB)Download full-size imageSilent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Silent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectAlzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Alzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectDisclosure: The author has nothing to disclose.Alzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectConflict of Interest: None.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectA framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectExternally and internally directed modes of cognition are thought to compete.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectThey only compete when both involve high levels of intentionality.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectThey can simultaneously co-occur at lower levels of intentionality.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectCompetition arises due to capacity-limited processes supported by the LPFC.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectExternally directed cognition (EDC) involves attending to stimuli in the external environment, whereas internally directed cognition (IDC) involves attending internally to thoughts, memories and mental imagery. To date, most studies have focused on the competition or trade-offs between these modes of cognition. However, both EDC and IDC include a variety of cognitive states that differ along multiple dimensions. These dimensions may influence the way in which EDC and IDC relate to each other. In this review, we present a novel framework that considers whether cognitive resources are oriented externally or internally, and also whether a given cognitive state involves intentional (i.e., voluntary) or spontaneous (i.e., involuntary) processing. Within this framework, we examine the conditions under which EDC and IDC are expected to either compete, or co-occur without interference. We argue that EDC and IDC are not inherently antagonistic, but when both involve higher levels of intentionality they are increasingly likely to compete, due to the capacity limitations of intentional processing. In contrast, if one or both involve spontaneous processing, EDC and IDC can co-occur with minimal interference given that involuntary processes are not subject to the same capacity constraints. A review of the brain regions implicated in EDC and IDC suggests that their neural substrates are partially segregated and partially convergent. Both EDC and IDC recruit the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during intentional processing, and may therefore compete over the processes and representational space it supports. However, at lower levels of intentionality, EDC and IDC rely on largely distinct neural structures, which may enable their co-occurrence without interference. The proposal that EDC and IDC can in some cases co-occur, provides a framework for understanding the complex mental states that underlie theory of mind, creativity, the influence of self-evaluative processing on cognitive control, and memory-guided attention.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Metabolic and electric brain patterns during pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by music masterpieces - ScienceDirectMetabolic and electric brain patterns during pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by music masterpieces - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Captured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectCaptured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectCaptured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectQuadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectComplex movement previously associated with improved executive function.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectParticipants undertook novel and challenging quadrupedal gait training programme.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectWCST was used to measure executive functions.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectSignificant improvements were observed in cognitive control.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectQuadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectTo determine the effects of a novel four-week quadrupedal gait training programme on markers of cognitive function and joint reposition sense in healthy adults.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectTwenty-two physically active sports science students (15 male and 7 female) were divided into two groups: a training group (TG) and a control group (CG).

Visual task data were then compared with auditory task data collected previously. In contrast with the results of the auditory task, the early (N1) and late (P300) stages exhibited no differences between Guqin and piano backgrounds during the visual task. Taking our previous study and this study together, we can conclude that: although the cultural-familiar music influenced selective attention both in the early and late stages, these effects appeared only within a sensory modality (auditory) but not in cross-sensory modalities (visual). Thus, the musical cultural factor is more obvious in intramodal than in crossmodal selective attention.Crossmodal effects of Guqin and piano music on selective attention: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multidimensional scaling of emotional responses to music in patients with temporal lobe resection - ScienceDirectThe present study investigated emotional responses to music by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis in patients with right or left medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions and matched normal controls (NC). Participants were required to evaluate emotional dissimilarities of nine musical excerpts that were selected to express graduated changes along the valence and arousal dimensions. For this purpose, they rated dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli on an eight-point scale and the resulting matrices were submitted to an MDS analysis. The results showed that patients did not differ from NC participants in evaluating emotional feelings induced by the musical excerpts, suggesting that all participants were able to distinguish refined emotions. We concluded that the ability to detect and use emotional valence and arousal when making dissimilarity judgments was not strongly impaired by a right or left MTL lesion. This finding has important clinical implications and is discussed in light of current neuropsychological studies on emotion. It suggests that emotional responses to music can be at least partially preserved at a non-verbal level in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage including the amygdala.Multidimensional scaling of emotional responses to music in patients with temporal lobe resection - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Purchase occasion influence on the role of music in advertising - ScienceDirectThe role of background music in audience responses to commercials (and other marketing elements) has received increasing attention in recent years. This article extends the discussion of music's influence in two ways: (1) by using music theory to analyze and investigate the effects of music's structural profiles on consumers' moods and emotions and (2) by examining the relationship between music's evoked moods that are congruent versus incongruent with the purchase occasion and the resulting effect on purchase intentions. The study reported provides empirical support for the notion that when music is used to evoke emotions congruent with the symbolic meaning of product purchase, the likelihood of purchasing is enhanced.Purchase occasion influence on the role of music in advertising - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectA music therapy case study is presented with a woman with Alzheimer's disease who participates in improvisation and song writing.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy research in dementia care is examined and links between person centred therapy and music therapy are highlighted.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing is identified as a potent therapeutic technique for working with people with dementia.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy afforded reminiscence, emotional self-expression and the client was able to experience herself in new ways and process what was happening in her life.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in the Attention Economy - ScienceDirectCognition in the Attention Economy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectEffects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectEffects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Attitude scale development study in relation to music teaching course - ScienceDirectThe effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectObjectives. To examine: (a) the effect of music type on running time and on sensations and thoughts experienced by the runners under high physical exertion, and (b) the role that music plays in the use of two distinct self-regulation techniques during high exertion, namely dissociative and motivational.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectDesign and procedure. Three studies were conducted. In Study 1 and Study 2, performed in the laboratory, participants ran at 90% of their maximal oxygen uptake on a motorized treadmill four times, once each with rock, dance, and inspirational music, and once without attending to music. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate (HR) were monitored during the run, and discomfort symptoms and music-specific questions were examined. In Study 3, performed in the field, participants ran a hilly course eight times, four under a competitive-pair condition, and four under a single-mode condition. Running time was the dependent variable.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectResults. Music failed to influence HR, RPE, and sensations of exertion in the three studies. However, about 30% of the participants indicated that the music helped them at the beginning of the run. The participants stated that music both directed their attention to the music and motivated them to continue. Despite the heavy workload reported by the runners, running with music was perceived as beneficial by many.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectConclusions: People engaged in high intensity running may benefit from listening to music, but may not increase their ability to sustain that effort longer than they could without music.

In order to build human-level-efficient tools for data analysis, it is necessary to have a theory of how concepts are represented in the human brain. This theory should specify (a) the structure and semantics of concept representations in the human brain, and (b) types, formats and specific patterns of neuronal activity instantiating these representations. The key to a biologically-informed human brain model begins with the mapping of (a) to (b), i.e., of the emotional Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (eBICA) to informative features and characteristics of brain activity. The result is a detailed description of the information processing level of the dynamics of emotional evaluation of other agents and relationships with them in the process of joint activities, and the role of this evaluation in decision-making and generation of behavior based on the selected emotional cognitive architecture.Toward a BICA-Model-Based Study of Cognition Using Brain Imaging Techniques - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2015.The emotional power of music: How music enhances the feeling of affective pictures - ScienceDirectThe emotional power of music: How music enhances the feeling of affective pictures - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of Need for Cognition on Internet use revisited - ScienceDirectThe effects of Need for Cognition on Internet use revisited - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectThe effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectProcessing speed and attention improved after a 3-month aerobic exercise training.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectImprovement in verbal learning occurred regardless of the type of exercise training.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectStretching exercise showed some modest improvements in cognition at follow-up.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectAerobic exercise (AE) has been shown to improve cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether these exercise-induced cognitive benefits persist beyond the training period. Accordingly, the present study sought to examine the immediate and maintenance effects of AE on a wide range of cognitive functions in 75 schizophrenia patients randomized to 12 weeks of either moderate-intensity treadmill exercise or stretching and toning exercise that served as a control. Participants completed assessments of neurocognition and cardiovascular fitness at pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. The results showed that the AE group outperformed the controls on processing speed and attention at the end of intervention. The two groups did not differ significantly in any cognitive outcome measured at follow-up; however, improvement over time was noted in certain cognitive domains in AE group. The average effect sizes at follow-up were 0.53 and 0.35 for AE and control groups, respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in aerobic fitness at posttest and follow-up, and that fitness level was not related to changes in cognitive performance. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a trend towards beneficial effects of physical activity on cognition over a short follow-up period in favor of AE.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical emotions, cognitive science, and art of music - ScienceDirectVarious proposals and criticisms are addressed.

Music-induced movement was recorded by an optical motion-capture system, the data from which 55 postural, kinematic, and kinetic movement features were computed. These features were subsequently reduced to five principal components of movement representing Local Movement, Global Movement, Hand Flux, Head Speed, and Hand Distance. Multivariate Analyses revealed significant effects on these components of both personality and genre, as well as several interactions between the two. Each personality dimension was associated with a different pattern of movement characteristics, with Extraversion and Neuroticism eliciting the clearest relationships. Latin, Techno, and Rock music, meanwhile, most clearly elicited different movement characteristics.Effects of the Big Five and musical genre on music-induced movement - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Historical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectHistorical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Historical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectTia DeNora teaches sociology at Exeter University (UK).

However, the exact source of these effects remains unclear. Given the well-known effects of sound on physiological activity, especially those of noise and of music, and on the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol in particular, we hypothesized that music may be a major source of stress during video game playing. We thus examined the effect of built-in music on cortisol secretion as a consequence of video game playing. Players were assigned quasi-randomly to either a Music or a Silence condition. Four saliva samples were taken, that is, after practice (T1), immediately after having played for 10 minutes (T2), 15 minutes after the end of the experiment (T3), and 30 minutes after the end of the experiment (T4). The results show that the Music group had significantly higher cortisol levels at T3, that is, when cortisol levels are assumed to reflect the stress induced by the game. These findings suggest for the first time that the auditory input contributes significantly to the stress response found during video game playing.Physiological stress response to video-game playing: the contribution of built-in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectReplication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectAdvanced and novice performance examined in conservatoire instrumentalists.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectA/T and SMR neurofeedback were compared with prepared and improvised pieces.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectA/T enhanced creativity/musicality, technique and communication.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectSMR improved technique and communication only in novice performance.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectNeurofeedback learning/performance outcome correlations support causation.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectReplication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Towards a neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectMusic perception involves complex brain functions underlying acoustic analysis, auditory memory, auditory scene analysis, and processing of musical syntax and semantics. Moreover, music perception potentially affects emotion, influences the autonomic nervous system, the hormonal and immune systems, and activates (pre)motor representations. During the past few years, research activities on different aspects of music processing and their neural correlates have rapidly progressed. This article provides an overview of recent developments and a framework for the perceptual side of music processing. This framework lays out a model of the cognitive modules involved in music perception, and incorporates information about the time course of activity of some of these modules, as well as research findings about where in the brain these modules might be located.Towards a neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cues for self-recognition in point-light displays of actions performed in synchrony with music - ScienceDirectCues for self-recognition in point-light displays of actions performed in synchrony with music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectSelf-recognition by musical sounds is a fertile domain for investigating agency.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectCue integration is a key process in agency attribution in musical contexts.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectMusic research on agency has implications for theories of embodied cognition.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectImplications for research designs and applied musical practice are discussed.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.From domain-generality to domain-sensitivity: 4-Month-olds learn an abstract repetition rule in music that 7-month-olds do not - ScienceDirectLearning must be constrained for it to lead to productive generalizations. Although biology is undoubtedly an important source of constraints, prior experience may be another, leading learners to represent input in ways that are more conducive to some generalizations than others, and/or to up- and down-weight features when entertaining generalizations. In two experiments, 4-month-old and 7-month-old infants were familiarized with sequences of musical chords or tones adhering either to an AAB pattern or an ABA pattern. In both cases, the 4-month-olds learned the generalization, but the 7-month-olds did not. The success of the 4-month-olds appears to contradict an account that this type of pattern learning is the provenance of a language-specific rule-learning module. It is not yet clear what drives the age-related change, but plausible candidates include differential experience with language and music, as well as interactions between general cognitive development and stimulus complexity.From domain-generality to domain-sensitivity: 4-Month-olds learn an abstract repetition rule in music that 7-month-olds do not - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The nature of music from a biological perspective - ScienceDirectMusic, as language, is a universal human trait. Throughout human history and across all cultures, people have produced and enjoyed music. Despite its ubiquity, the musical capacity is rarely studied as a biological function. Music is typically viewed as a cultural invention. In this paper, the evidence bearing on the biological perspective of the musical capacity is reviewed. Related issues, such as domain-specificity, innateness, and brain localization, are addressed in an attempt to offer a unified conceptual basis for the study of music processing. This scheme should facilitate the study of the biological foundations of music by bringing together the fields of genetics, developmental and comparative research, neurosciences, and musicology.The nature of music from a biological perspective - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectMusic listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectMusic listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of Music Therapy on Self- and Experienced Stigma in Patients on an Acute Care Psychiatric Unit: A Randomized Three Group Effectiveness Study - ScienceDirectEffects of Music Therapy on Self- and Experienced Stigma in Patients on an Acute Care Psychiatric Unit: A Randomized Three Group Effectiveness Study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Extended cognition and the space of social interaction - ScienceDirectExtended cognition and the space of social interaction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectObjectives: To examine the effects of self-selected asynchronous (background) music on flow and netball shooting performance in three netball players. Based on the research of Karageorghis and Terry (1999) it was hypothesized that music would promote flow and would therefore have a positive impact on netball shooting performance.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectDesign: An idiographic single-subject multiple baselines across-subjects design was employed (Wollman, 1986). The rationale centred upon the work of Patrick and Hrycaiko (1998) who indicated that single-subject designs were the most appropriate methodology for applied research.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectMethods: The participants comprised three collegiate netball players who were asked to complete 11 performance trials. Each trial involved taking 12 shots from lines located at three shooting positions. After each performance trial, flow and the internal experience of each player were assessed using the Flow State Scale (Jackson & Marsh, 1996) and Practical Assessment Questionnaire. Participants received the intervention of asynchronous music with the length of pre-intervention baseline increasing for each succeeding player.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectResults: Two of the participants experienced an increase in the perception of flow while all three participants improved their netball shooting performance. In addition, participants indicated that the intervention helped them to control both the emotions and cognitions that impacted upon their performance.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectConclusions: Interventions comprising self-selected music and imagery can enhance athletic performance by triggering emotions and cognitions associated with flow.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tuning the brain for music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectTo study the effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture daily in a clinical setting.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAcupuncture Unit at Shenzhen Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shenzhen City of China.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectSixty children with cerebral palsy undergoing acupuncture.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectEffects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectEffects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectThis study demonstrates that listening to music while receiving acupuncture can relieve anxiety among children with cerebral palsy; however, no effect was observed in terms of pain reduction.

It relies on converging evidence from anecdotal accounts of creativity and tightly controlled laboratory studies designed to examine the processes that are assumed to operate in those anecdotes. Specific examples of creative cognition studies are described in detail with a particular focus on research concerned with accessing conceptual information at varying levels of abstraction and combining previously separate concepts. Important aspects of the design of these studies are delineated, including the main creative tasks, properties of the materials used, characteristics of responses observed, including their originality and practicality, participant and rater attributes, and the relations among these and other study aspects. Other issues addressed are generality across materials, populations, and situations, as well as causal versus correlational connections among processes, structures and creative outcomes.Creative cognition as a window on creativity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectMusical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe identify neural markers for musical expertise using single-trial analysis of the EEG.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe show that experts and novices have different spatio-temporal neural signatures of anomaly detection.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectMusical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectWe provide evidence for the embodied cognition hypothesis.Musical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectMusical experts recruit action-related neural structures in harmonic anomaly detection: Evidence for embodied cognition in expertise - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectRhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectNeural entrainment to rhythmic stimuli is largely automatic but can be modulated.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectPotential confound between rhythmic evoked responses and entrained oscillations.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectFor hierarchically structured stimuli, entrainment to a basic organizing rhythm.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectLink between temporal processing involved in speech and music perception.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectRhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Leisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectLeisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectLeisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectIn this paper, a novel probabilistic model of harmonic progressions and a generation scheme based on such model are presented. On the basis of the large amount of publications that show the stochastic nature of the music and the possibility of modelling it by means of statistical processes, this paper shows how to create a non-homogeneous Markov chain to automatically generate harmonic progressions by building a temporal reference of the internal beat structure of music to guide the progressions. Thus, this new model develops on the classic transition matrix to include a beat-dependent / temporal layer to model the residency time.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectThe method for the automatic creation of harmonic progressions based on the model developed is presented after the model. The harmonic progressions generated by our scheme are coherent with the style of the training data employed and, thanks to the specific temporal layer designed, the musical mid-term and long-term dependencies that lead to a natural and logic cadence are taken into account. The model developed is usable for the automatic generation of harmonic patterns that can be used to enlarge the flexibility and creativity of pattern-based computational music composers.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.It's beginning to smell (and sound) a lot like Christmas: the interactive effects of ambient scent and music in a retail setting - ScienceDirectIt's beginning to smell (and sound) a lot like Christmas: the interactive effects of ambient scent and music in a retail setting - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Structure of Cognition: Attentional Episodes in Mind and Brain - ScienceDirectReactions to music, touch and object presentation in the final stage of dementia: an exploratory study - ScienceDirectTwo patients in the final stage of dementia of Alzheimer type were stimulated with music, touch and object presentation during 12 consecutive days (16 trials per patient).

There is great variation in preference patterns for music. However, the cause of such individual differences has not been fully elucidated to date. Many behavioral traits, including personality, are known to be influenced by steroid-hormone testosterone. On this basis, we conjectured that testosterone partly determines individual differences in music preference. To examine this hypothesis, in the present study, we investigated the association between salivary testosterone concentration and strength of preference for five different music types in young males and females. The results revealed a significant negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music, such as classical and jazz in males. This relationship was not mediated by the big-five personality traits. These findings indicate the possibility that neuroendocrinological function can exert influences on music preference patterns.Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectMusic exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectEarly music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of rats.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectThe BDNF/TrkB level of DH CA3 and DG was obviously increased by exposed to music.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectThe enhanced spatial memory is associated with BDNF/TrkB level of DH CA3 and DG.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectPrevious research has shown that dorsal hippocampus plays an important role in spatial memory process. Music exposure can enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression level in dorsal hippocampus (DH) and thus enhance spatial cognition ability. But whether music experience may affect different subregions of DH in the same degree remains unclear. Here, we studied the effects of exposure to Mozart K.448 on learning behavior in developing rats using the classical Morris water maze task. The results showed that early music exposure could enhance significantly learning performance of the rats in the water maze test. Meanwhile, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA3 (dCA3) and dentate gyrus (dDG) was significantly enhanced in rats exposed to Mozart music as compared to those without music exposure. In contrast, the BDNF/TrkB level of dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) was not affected. The results suggest that the spatial memory improvement by music exposure in rats may be associated with the enhanced BDNF/TrkB level of dCA3 and dDG.Music exposure improves spatial cognition by enhancing the BDNF level of dorsal hippocampal subregions in the developing rats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectComplexity measures of music - ScienceDirectWe address the issue of detecting the crucial events in music by analyzing the volume change of a music piece.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectIt is found that multifractality of the Mozart piece performed by human is broader than the one played by computer.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectThe power spectrum confirms the existence of 1/f noise in studied music pieces.Complexity measures of music - ScienceDirectEffect of music intervention on apathy in nursing home residents with dementia - ScienceDirectEffect of music intervention on apathy in nursing home residents with dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectWe investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular on-demand music streaming services.Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services - ScienceDirectOur study resulted into two variants, differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method, NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC).

The social network was a habitual component of the patient's life, but not a source of sharing of personal experiences, safety or comfort. Neuropsychological tests showed deficits in object and figure naming, verbal fluency, short and long-term verbal memory, short-term spatial memory, selective attention, and visuomotor coordination. After AMT, the cognitive profile significantly improved in attention, visuomotor coordination, and verbal and spatial memory. Such positive changes were confirmed at the three-months follow-up. An increase of the interpersonal interactions and consistent reduction of anxiety were also observed.Active music therapy improves cognition and behaviour in chronic vascular encephalopathy: A case report - ScienceDirectIn selected patients with VCI-ND, a well-structured AMT intervention added to standard therapy may contribute in determining a stable improvement of cognitive and psycho-behavioural aspects.

However, no research has previously investigated the development of music skills in this population. In this study, we used the cross-sectional developmental trajectories approach to assess the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Thus, we evaluated the role of change over time on pitch-related music skills and the developmental relationships between music skills and different cognitive areas. In the TD children, the pitch-related music skills improved with chronological age and cognitive development. In the children with WS, developmental relationships were only found between several pitch-related music skills and specific cognitive processes. We also found non-systematic relationships between chronological age and the pitch-related music skills, stabilization in the level reached in music when cognitive development was considered, and uneven associations between cognitive and music skills. In addition, the TD and WS groups differed in their patterns of pitch-related music skill development. These results suggest that the development of pitch-related music skills in children with WS is atypical. Our findings stand in contrast with the views that claim innate modularity for music in WS; rather, they are consistent with neuroconstructivist accounts.Developmental trajectories of pitch-related music skills in children with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectMozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectMozart effect, cognitive dissonance, and the pleasure of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectMusic Education: Some Aspects of Pedagogical Efficiency of Popular Music Integration - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectWe examined effects of more vs. less time in kindergarten general music.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with stronger executive functions.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectMore time was not associated with more positive attitudes about self and school.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIs more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Is more time in general music class associated with stronger extra-musical outcomes in kindergarten? - ScienceDirectIndividuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectIndividuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirect12 males with major depression (MDD) completed measures of anhedonia and depression.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectAlso underwent fMRI whilst listening to preferred classical music.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectMDD group showed less activation of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) than healthy controls.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectMDD group showed attenuation of NAcc response in later compared to earlier times.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectSupports theories that MDD involves inability to sustain reward network activation.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectWe investigated the ability of preferred classical music to activate the nucleus accumbens in patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve males with MDD and 10 never mentally ill male healthy controls (HC) completed measures of anhedonia and depression severity, and listened to 90-second segments of preferred classical music during fMRI. Compared to HCs, individuals with MDD showed less activation of the left nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Individuals with MDD showed attenuation of the left NAcc response in later compared to earlier parts of the experiment, supporting theories that MDD involves an inability to sustain reward network activation. Counter intuitively, we found that NAcc activity during early music listening was associated with greater depression severity. In whole-brain analyses, anhedonia scores predicted activity in regions within the default mode network, supporting previous findings. Our results support theories that MDD involves an inability to sustain reward network activation. It also highlights that pleasant classical music can engage critical neural reward circuitry in MDD.Individuals with more severe depression fail to sustain nucleus accumbens activity to preferred music over time - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectMicrosaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectWe applied an attentional definition for state absorption.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectMicrosaccade rates are known to be linked to attentional processing and cognitive load.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectHere we show that microsaccade rate is also linked to state absorption during intense music listening.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectResults indicate that absorption can be measured indirectly by cross-modal interactions using eye tracking.Microsaccade-rate indicates absorption by music listening - ScienceDirectThe power of music is a literary topos, which can be attributed to intense and personally significant experiences, one of them being the state of absorption. Such phenomenal states are difficult to grasp objectively. We investigated the state of musical absorption by using eye tracking. We utilized a load related definition of state absorption: multimodal resources are committed to create a unified representation of music. Resource allocation was measured indirectly by microsaccade rate, known to indicate cognitive processing load. We showed in Exp. 1 that microsaccade rate also indicates state absorption. Hence, there is cross-modal coupling between an auditory aesthetic experience and fixational eye movements. When removing the fixational stimulus in Exp. 2, saccades are no longer generated upon visual input and the cross-modal coupling disappeared. Results are interpreted in favor of the load hypothesis of microsaccade rate and against the assumption of general slowing by state absorption.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectMusic performance anxiety and perfectionism affect adult musicians.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe study examined the development of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age children.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThere was a strong correlations between music performance anxiety and perfectionism between ages 10 and 17.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectLevels of music performance anxiety and perfectionism increase with years of experience.The developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectThe developmental features of music performance anxiety and perfectionism in school age music students - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Can live music therapy reduce distress and pain in children with burns after wound care procedures?

Across three experiments, we find that vocal music leads to poorer cognitive and attitudinal outcomes for consumers lower in working memory capacity but does not affect those higher in working memory capacity. However, short-term habituation to background music helps mitigate this negative effect of vocal music on consumer ad recall. Finally, consumer performances on computing discount prices are also affected by music type depending upon whether prices are communicated in verbal or numeric form. Overall, this research lays out an executive-attention based process mechanism explaining when and how background music shapes consumer learning and memory. The outlined theory enriches the literature on music effects as well as immediate-term learning by explicating the role of selective attention in the processing of multi-modal marketing stimuli.Role of executive attention in consumer learning with background music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Brain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectBrain Hemisphericity and Music Performance Level in Undergraduate Music Students and Philharmonic Musicians - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectGuided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMusic and imagery was used for management of PTSD symptoms in women who had experienced Military Sexual Trauma.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectParticipants used music to regulate emotions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectImagery was a learned resource for grounding.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectEffects carried over between sessions.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectThree out of four participants scored clinically significant reductions and one out of four scored a reliable reduction of PTSD symptoms.Guided Imagery and Music with female military veterans: An intervention development study - ScienceDirectMilitary Sexual Trauma (MST) is an issue among returning veterans that causes a significant amount of distress with a high occurrence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

The present study investigated the performance of skilled musicians on cognitively demanding sustained attention tasks, measuring both temporal and visual discrimination over a prolonged duration. Participants with extensive formal music training were found to have superior performance on a temporal discrimination task, but not a visual discrimination task, compared to participants with no music training. In addition, no differences were found between groups in vigilance decrement in either type of task. Although no differences were evident in vigilance per se, the results indicate that performance in an attention-demanding temporal discrimination task was superior in individuals with extensive music training. We speculate that this basic cognitive ability may contribute to advantages that musicians show in other cognitive measures.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Examining the relationship between skilled music training and attention - ScienceDirectAddress: 3026 East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, United States.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectNeural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectPianists imitated or listened to chord sequences with harmonic violations in fMRI.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectfMRI and rfMRI-connectivity showed dorsal motor and ventral audio streams for music.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectRight IFG is likely to integrate harmonic information in motor and audio format.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectParietal/temporal areas may be tied to motoric and auditory knowledge of harmony.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectThe ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.Neural networks for harmonic structure in music perception and action - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tracting the neural basis of music: Deficient structural connectivity underlying acquired amusia - ScienceDirectAcquired amusia provides a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental neural architectures of musical processing due to the transition from a functioning to defective music processing system. Yet, the white matter (WM) deficits in amusia remain systematically unexplored. To evaluate which WM structures form the neural basis for acquired amusia and its recovery, we studied 42 stroke patients longitudinally at acute, 3-month, and 6-month post-stroke stages using DTI [tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and deterministic tractography (DT)] and the Scale and Rhythm subtests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA). Non-recovered amusia was associated with structural damage and subsequent degeneration in multiple WM tracts including the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and frontal aslant tract (FAT), as well as in the corpus callosum (CC) and its posterior part (tapetum). In a linear regression analysis, the volume of the right IFOF was the main predictor of MBEA performance across time.

The findings indicate that many people report that they choose to listen to sad music when experiencing sadness, and after experiencing negative events. A range of motivations have been found as to why people choose to listen to sad music, these include the role of music in; validating emotions, providing solace, providing rewarding emotional experiences, and aiding reflection and relaxation. For people who listen to sad music as an adaptive way to cope, some evidence in this review indicates that this may be a healthy strategy more applicable for psychologically healthy people, rather than those who are depressed or anxious. Findings indicate that depressed individuals, and ruminators, can use sad music adaptively, but also maladaptively. Sad music has also been shown to provide support when people are experiencing negative life events, as it enables the expression, identification, and understanding of the situation, which in turn aids the experience of consolation, and, ultimately, acceptance coping. Future directions for research, and the potential uses of sad music listening in therapeutic settings are discussed.The appeal of sad music: A brief overview of current directions in research on motivations for listening to sad music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectMusic therapy is one of the types of active ageing programmes which are offered to elderly people. The usefulness of this programme in the field of dementia is beginning to be recognised by the scientific community, since studies have reported physical, cognitive, and psychological benefits. Further studies detailing the changes resulting from the use of music therapy with Alzheimer patients are needed.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectTo determine the clinical improvement profile of Alzheimer patients who have undergone music therapy.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectForty-two patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) underwent music therapy for 6 weeks. The changes in results on the Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Barthel Index scores were studied. We also analysed whether or not these changes were influenced by the degree of dementia severity.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectSignificant improvement was observed in memory, orientation, depression and anxiety (HAD scale) in both mild and moderate cases; in anxiety (NPI scale) in mild cases; and in delirium, hallucinations, agitation, irritability, and language disorders in the group with moderate AD. The effect on cognitive measures was appreciable after only 4 music therapy sessions.Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects - ScienceDirectIn the sample studied, music therapy improved some cognitive, psychological, and behavioural alterations in patients with AD.

For the perception of such structures, the detection of each boundary is crucial. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we explore the perception of hierarchical boundaries in music, and test whether musical expertise modifies such processing. Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.Perception of hierarchical boundaries in music and its modulation by expertise - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Critical Thinking and Music Education - ScienceDirectCritical Thinking and Music Education - ScienceDirectSelection and/or peer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectPast research has demonstrated that music often negatively impacts performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, including academically relevant tasks. There are, however, discrepancies in the literature, including a handful of instances where no effect of music was observed. We tested the novel hypothesis that working-memory capacity moderated the detrimental effect of music on academic performance. Undergraduate students worked on reading-comprehension and math tasks under both music and silence conditions before completing a battery of working-memory capacity assessments. Although music led to a significant decline in performance overall, working-memory capacity moderated this effect in the reading-comprehension tasks. These findings suggest that individuals who are better able to control their attention (as indexed by working-memory capacity) may be protected from music-related distraction when completing certain kinds of academically relevant tasks.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual Differences in Working Memory Predict the Effect of Music on Student Performance - ScienceDirectAuthor NoteGenetic algorithms for music variation on genom platform - ScienceDirectThis paper considers the problems of algorithmic music variations and modeling of musical creativity in general with a help of genetic algorithms. The proposed model of algorithmic musical variations with genetic algorithms is based on analysis and adaptation of ideas about algorithmic musical variations provided by R. Kh. Zaripov. Implementation of created model is based on Genom software, the platform for experiments in modeling of musical creativity with genetic algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed model can be used to create simple musical variations. The practical application of this system lies in interactive help for composer in creationof various musical ideas for further development. Several experimental results are shown in a form of musical scores.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectNeurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectNeurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectIn the first half of the 20th century, performing neurosurgery on some musicians, such as Maurice Ravel, Josef Hassid, and George Gershwin, resulted in a fatal outcome. The cause of this is probably that neurosurgery had not been developed yet in the first half of the 20th century. In the past 3 decades, the neurosurgical operations of musicians show that musicians have rich associations among auditory, somatic, and sensorial systems.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectIt is clear that we have much to learn from studies about music and brain function that derive from our surgical experiences with patients. The neuronal plasticity of musicians' brains may be different from that of nonmusicians' brains. Musicians with enhanced motor skills have greater capacity for plasticity because of enriched interhemispheric connections. Listening to music and the effect of Mozart in neurosurgical practice, intensive care, or rehabilitation were documented in many studies. As authors, we mean something different: Its effectiveness should be studied. We concluded that in current neurosurgical practice, Mozart has an effect. More research and clinical studies are needed.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neurosurgery and Music; Effect of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - ScienceDirectConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectThe role of auditory perception for cycling safety is explored.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMusic and phone conversation negatively affect perception of traffic sounds.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectCyclists compensate for listening to music and talking on the phone.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMajority of cyclists never or seldom encounter quiet (electric) cars on the road.Mobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectMobile phone conversations, listening to music and quiet (electric) cars: Are traffic sounds important for safe cycling? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cross-cultural music cognition: cognitive methodology applied to North Sami yoiks - ScienceDirectThis article is a study of melodic expectancy in North Sami yoiks, a style of music quite distinct from Western tonal music. Three different approaches were taken. The first approach was a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of 18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identified style characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two reference pitches, the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations (for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, T. (1997). Self-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer). One model was trained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral experiment including the correct continuation tone, while another was trained with a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The convergence of the three approaches showed that both listeners and the SOM model are influenced by the statistical distributions of tones and tone sequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided evidence supporting a core set of psychological principles underlying melody formation whose relative weights appear to differ across musical styles.Cross-cultural music cognition: cognitive methodology applied to North Sami yoiks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music (e.g., Chinese, Indian) increased the recall of menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectEthnic music increased the likelihood of choosing menu items from the same country.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectClassical music increased willingness to pay for products related to social identity.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCountry music increased willingness to pay for utilitarian products.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic congruity effects on consumer behavior are conceptualized in terms of cognitive priming of semantic networks in memory, and operationalized as congruent with a product's country of origin (Experiment 1), or congruent with the utilitarian (Experiment 2) or social identity (Experiments 2 and 3) connotations of a product. Hearing a specific genre of music (e.g., classical) activates related concepts in memory (e.g., expensive, sophisticated, formal, educated), which influences the memory for, perception of, and choice of products. Consistent with this account of music congruity effects, three laboratory experiments show that playing music of a specific genre during initial product exposure improved subsequent recall of conceptually related (i.e., congruent) products compared to unrelated products (Experiment 1), affected product choice in favor of congruent products (Experiment 1), and affected how much participants were willing to pay for congruent products (Experiments 2 and 3).Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectMusic Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 7867.Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice - ScienceDirectTel.: +61 08 9266 9279.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectBrain signals are recorded using EEG headset while listening to audio music.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectFour different emotions are recognized using hybrid features of EEG signals.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectEmotion recognition accuracy is analyzed for three different age groups.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectThe relationship between music genres and human emotions is examined.Human emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (354KB)Download full-size imageHuman emotion recognition and analysis in response to audio music using brain signals - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectMusic streaming systems that are useful and provide enjoyment lead to adoption.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectSystems that are useful and provide enjoyment reduce digital piracy.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of creativity facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectUsefulness and enjoyment of a system is a function of community facilitation.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectPreventing unauthorized downloading and other forms of digital piracy has been a persistent challenge. Strategies based on deterrence, ethical arguments, or technical measures have been effective, but only to a limited extent. The rising popularity of music streaming systems, however, affords the owners of digital content opportunities to experiment with alternative business models and value propositions that may also discourage digital piracy. The results of this field study involving 139 subjects suggest that music streaming systems that incorporate features that facilitate individual creativity and community building contributes towards the enjoyment and usefulness of the system. This in turn leads to music streaming adoption. The results of the study also show that the usefulness of a music streaming system is associated with a reduction in pirating intention. Surprisingly, a link between the enjoyment of a music streaming system and a reduction in digital pirating intention was not supported.The impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (137KB)Download full-size imageThe impact of creativity and community facilitation on music streaming adoption and digital piracy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectAn e-learning collaborative environment for music composing was examined.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectWe used assessment thorough video analysis and a semi-structured interview.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe technological context reshaped thinking and collaborative strategies.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCollaboration, identity and meta-cognition were critical.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectThe participants demonstrated awareness of the potentialities of the online tools.Creativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCreativity in virtual spaces: Communication modes employed during collaborative online music composition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectMusic and academic performance - ScienceDirectStudents who select music courses have better grades than the others in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCognitive mechanisms related to overcoming cognitive dissonances are discussed.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectEnjoyment of music might cause academic improvement.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectIn a previous study we demonstrated that listening to a pleasant music while performing an academic test helped students to overcome stress, to devote more time to more stressful and more complicated task and the grades were higher. Yet, there remained ambiguities as for the causes of the higher test performance of these students: do they perform better because they hear music during their examinations, or would they perform better anyway because they are more gifted/motivated? This motivated the current study as a preliminary step toward that general question: Do students who like/perform music have better grades than the others? Our results confirmed this hypothesis: students studying music have better grades in all subjects.Music and academic performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing - ScienceDirectMusic notation and English word reading both involve mapping horizontally arranged visual components to components in sound, in contrast to reading in logographic languages such as Chinese. Accordingly, music-reading expertise may influence English word processing more than Chinese character processing. Here we showed that musicians named English words significantly faster than non-musicians when words were presented in the left visual field/right hemisphere (RH) or the center position, suggesting an advantage of RH processing due to music reading experience. This effect was not observed in Chinese character naming. A follow-up ERP study showed that in a sequential matching task, musicians had reduced RH N170 responses to English non-words under the processing of musical segments as compared with non-musicians, suggesting a shared visual processing mechanism in the RH between music notation and English non-word reading. This shared mechanism may be related to the letter-by-letter, serial visual processing that characterizes RH English word recognition (e.g., Lavidor & Ellis, 2001), which may consequently facilitate English word processing in the RH in musicians. Thus, music reading experience may have differential influences on the processing of different languages, depending on their similarities in the cognitive processes involved.Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectMelody similarity in music is a perception of listeners based on cognitive method. Thus, the algorithms should be based on perceptually oriented computational model. We have used computer generated synthesized tune of popular song and its variations to understand similarity notion. We have generated variations of a tune by changing musical scale or relative duration of notes or notes itself and combination of them. The proposed approach to calculate similarity relationship between two tunes will be useful to model the melody similarity notion for various applications such as QBH (Query by humming), music classification and retrieval, music plagiarism etc.Modeling Melody Similarity Using Music Synthesis and Perception - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of International Conference on Advanced Computing Technologies and Applications (ICACTA-2015).Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectListening to happy music affected functional cerebral asymmetries.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectLeft hemispheric functioning was particularly sensitive to music listening.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in laterality were not mediated by changes in mood.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectTempo manipulation of the musical excerpt did not modulate the laterality effect.Music-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectMusic-induced changes in functional cerebral asymmetries - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectAdults with schizophrenia are less discriminative for harmonic changes in music, therefore, the perceptual and cognitive processing of understanding and responding to music may not be the same as that of healthy adults.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectSP group showed less sensitivity to the increased level of harmonic complexity within the music, suggesting that their evaluation of music complexity was not coherent.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectNo significant differences were found between groups in terms of their interest in and preference for harmonic progression in music.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe use of harmonic progression for adults with schizophrenia can be effectively considered in music selection.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectMusic therapists should incorporate an appropriate level of harmonic complexity in the music when used in mental health settings.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectPerception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perception of complexity, interest level, and preference for harmonic progression of music for adults with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectThe first two authors are co-first authors and contributed equally to this work.Realising the potential of art-based interventions in managerial learning: Embodied cognition as an explanatory theory - ScienceDirectTeachers and consultants increasingly use art-based interventions (ABIs) to facilitate manager learning. However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which ABIs produce learning outcomes of value to organizations. This theoretical paper addresses this concern by revisiting the philosophy of art and education in light of developments in neuroscience known as embodied cognition. Specifically, we examine the role played by simulations in behavioral change and the way in which ABIs can foster the creation of simulations. This leads to two propositions, a) representing a phenomenon through new simulations can create new possibilities for interacting with this phenomenon; and b) making art is a means by which managers can construct new simulations. The significance of these propositions is illustrated by re-interpreting three accounts of art-based interventions found in the literature. These propositions have important implications for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ABIs in management education. In particular, they emphasize the need to match art medium with desired outcomes, provide support for the view that ABIs are well suited to learning about complex managerial challenges, and question the effectiveness of verbal reflection as part of ABIs.Realising the potential of art-based interventions in managerial learning: Embodied cognition as an explanatory theory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mentalising music in frontotemporal dementia - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectInvestigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectTen untrained subjects listened to 3 culturally different styles of music stimuli.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were measured and global and local network properties compared.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectLight music and western classical music perception manifested small world properties.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectChinese and western classical music perception showed right lateralization.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectFurther research is needed to understand network properties of music perception.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectGraph theoretical analysis has recently become a popular research tool in neuroscience, however, there have been very few studies on brain responses to music perception, especially when culturally different styles of music are involved.Investigation of global and local network properties of music perception with culturally different styles of music - ScienceDirectElectroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music.

The aim of this prospective study was to verify the efficacy of a Non-Instrumental Musical Training (NIMT) on the Numerical Cognition systems in children with low achievement in math. For this purpose, we examined, with a cluster analysis, whether children with low scores on Numerical Cognition would be grouped in the same cluster at pre and post-NIMT. Participants were primary school children divided into two groups according to their scores on an Arithmetic test. Results with a specialized battery of Numerical Cognition revealed improvements for Cluster 2 (children with low achievement in math) especially for number production capacity compared to normative data. Besides, the number of children with low scores in Numerical Cognition decreased at post-NIMT. These findings suggest that NIMT enhances Numerical Cognition and seems to be a useful tool for rehabilitation of children with low achievement in math.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well.

The objective of the research is to document the experiences of music teachers in using locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study in south-eastern Estonian schools. As the main research problem, the question was posed: how and to what extent do teachers use their locality-related traditions in music lessons at the second stage of study? The research questions developed to solve the problem aimed to find out how music teachers define the concept of locality-related tradition and whether and how they utilize locality-related tradition in music lessons.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectLocal Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectMusic Spectrum: A Music Immersion Virtual Environment for Children with Autism - ScienceDirectVisual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectThis study looks into the visual perception of phrasing in a Tai Chi routine as affected by a change of music.

Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectA combination of acoustic and neurophysiological features are used to attempt to predict music-induced emotion.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectSignificant prediction results are achieved.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectThese results are significantly better when a combination of features is used than either feature alone.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectFeatures selected include alpha and beta band powers and mel-cepstral coefficients.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectIt is widely acknowledged that music can communicate and induce a wide range of emotions in the listener. However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectCognition in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectAnalysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to find out the extent to which Slovenian general education teachers follow the principles of a balanced music objectives planning in the prevailing affective, psychomotor and cognitive domains. The research sample involves 372 Slovenian student and current general education teachers who, working in pairs, prepared 186 lesson plans for music education. The research results showed that the majority of the musical objectives planned in this study, pertained to the psychomotor domain, followed by the cognitive objectives and by the least represented objectives of the affective domain.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectHumans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched.

It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectThe Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music. Similarly, RPE was higher in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition, but music had no effect.

We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectFree listening of music evokes ERPs similar to simplified stimuli.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectRapid changes in musical features of polyphonic music evoke N100 and P200 response.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectThe N100 and P200 responses are detected across different musical genres.Event-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectEvent-related brain responses while listening to entire pieces of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectThe study provides a detailed analysis of the music experiences of clients in treatment for alcohol and drug problems.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectClients of a hospital alcohol and drug service said that music listening intensified their emotional response to drug taking and vice versa.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectForty-three percent of the clients in residential rehabilitation identified a specific song or genre of music that cued an urge to use substances.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMechanisms linking music with cravings included associations with their previous substance use; music evoked emotions associated with previous substance use; and music contained lyrics concerning their primary substance.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectA majority of clients endorsed a view that music was important in their recovery from substance misuse.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectMusic is commonly associated with substance use yet little is known about the music experiences of adults with substance use disorders. In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery.

Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach.

As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe show that respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectArgue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectIn spite of its importance as a life-defining rhythmic movement and its constant rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the body, respiration has not received attention in Embodied Cognition (EC) literature. Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBoth video games and music can increase physical excitement.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate a higher level than nonviolent video games.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThe excitement of background music interacts with game on aggression.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate more aggression regardless of pleasure level of music.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Matthias Rauterberg.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectEnhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectOutcomes showed the importance of early diagnosis of developmental dyscalculia to provide a satisfactory rehabilitation.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectMusical Training has a differential effect of Numerical Cognition comparing children with typical development and developmental dyscalculia.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectPerformance in Number Production increased after the Musical Training.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectStudies suggest that musical training enhances spatial-temporal reasoning and leads to greater learning of mathematical concepts. The aim of this prospective study was to verify the efficacy of a Non-Instrumental Musical Training (NIMT) on the Numerical Cognition systems in children with low achievement in math. For this purpose, we examined, with a cluster analysis, whether children with low scores on Numerical Cognition would be grouped in the same cluster at pre and post-NIMT. Participants were primary school children divided into two groups according to their scores on an Arithmetic test. Results with a specialized battery of Numerical Cognition revealed improvements for Cluster 2 (children with low achievement in math) especially for number production capacity compared to normative data. Besides, the number of children with low scores in Numerical Cognition decreased at post-NIMT. These findings suggest that NIMT enhances Numerical Cognition and seems to be a useful tool for rehabilitation of children with low achievement in math.Enhancement of numeric cognition in children with low achievement in mathematic after a non-instrumental musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music during mechanical ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: A review - ScienceDirectMechanical ventilation (MV) causes many distressing symptoms. Weaning, the gradual decrease in ventilator assistance leading to termination of MV, increases respiratory effort, which may exacerbate symptoms and prolong MV. Music, a non-pharmacological intervention without side effects may benefit patients during weaning from mechanical ventilatory support. A narrative review of OVID Medline, PsychINFO, and CINAHL databases was conducted to examine the evidence for the use of music intervention in MV and MV weaning. Music intervention had a positive impact on ventilated patients; 16 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies were identified. Quantitative studies included randomized clinical trials (10), case controls (3), pilot studies (2) and a feasibility study. Evidence supports music as an effective intervention that can lesson symptoms related to MV and promote effective weaning. It has potential to reduce costs and increase patient satisfaction. However, more studies are needed to establish its use during MV weaning.The influence of music during mechanical ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: A review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic Therapy in Adolescent Disruptive Behaviour - ScienceDirectMusic and Cochlear Implants - ScienceDirectCurrently, most people with modern multichannel cochlear implant systems can understand speech in quiet environment very well. However, studies in recent decades reported a lack of satisfaction in music perception with cochlear implants. This article reviews the literature on music ability of cochlear implant users by presenting a systematic outline of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant recipients with regard to their music perception as well as production. The review also evaluates the similarities and differences between electric hearing and acoustic hearing regarding music perception. We summarize the research results in terms of the individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and timbre). Finally, we briefly introduce the vocal singing of prelingually-deafened children with cochlear implants as evaluated by acoustic measures.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's music has been tried in children with refractory encephalopathies.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMusic therapy decreased seizure recurrence in about 45% of children.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectAll responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior.Mozart's music in children with drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathies - ScienceDirectMozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in both adults and young patients.

The objective of the research is to document the experiences of music teachers in using locality-related tradition in music lessons in the second stage of study in south-eastern Estonian schools. As the main research problem, the question was posed: how and to what extent do teachers use their locality-related traditions in music lessons at the second stage of study? The research questions developed to solve the problem aimed to find out how music teachers define the concept of locality-related tradition and whether and how they utilize locality-related tradition in music lessons.Local Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectLocal Cultural Heritage Usage in Music Studies in South-eastern Estonian Schools - ScienceDirectMusic Spectrum: A Music Immersion Virtual Environment for Children with Autism - ScienceDirectVisual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectThis study looks into the visual perception of phrasing in a Tai Chi routine as affected by a change of music. The research aimed to investigate whether the quality of phrasing between music and movement is improved with a more congruent accompaniment. Sixty respondents, undergraduate music majors from two universities in Malaysia, were invited to participate in this study. They were asked to evaluate the phrasing between music and movement in videos of the same Tai Chi routine but with two different music accompaniments. It was found that there is a significant difference in the evaluation, and that the video with music composed to provide a better congruence in phrasing received a higher rating.Visual Perception of Phrasing in a Tai Chi Routine Using Different Music Accompaniments - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WS) is characterized by verbal memory delays and a love of music.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWe examine if novel (unfamiliar) music can enhance verbal memory in WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectThose with formal music training showed improved verbal memory.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectFormal music training may enhance educational outcomes for those with WS.Music lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectMusic lessons are associated with increased verbal memory in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectStatistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children performed better at auditory but not visual statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusically trained children also showed larger changes in online statistical learning ERPs.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in musical abilities are associated with capacity for statistical learning.Statistical learning and auditory processing in children with music training: An ERP study - ScienceDirectThe question whether musical training is associated with enhanced auditory and cognitive abilities in children is of considerable interest.

Thus, it is important to have early interventions in the domains of social and affective functioning. Recent research efforts have focused on the innovative applications of Assistive Technologies (AT) for rehabilitation efforts. However, despite excellent preliminary findings, the efficacy of AT remains limited. This paper aims to fill the identified efficacy gap by proposing a framework incorporating music as a therapy which will be developed into a technological application to help children with autism to deal with their emotional dysfunctions. The proposal is also based on findings which show that this special population prefers and has successfully used technological devices such as the iPad for learning new skills.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2016.Music Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectMasterminded EasyChair and created the first stable version of this documentMusic Inspired Framework for Remediating Emotional Deficits in Autism - ScienceDirectCreated the first draft of this documentMusic Biology: All This Useful Beauty - ScienceDirectA systematic review on the effects of active participation in rhythm-centred music making on different aspects of health - ScienceDirectRhythm-centred music making (RMM) especially drumming and percussion music has been shown to be effective in promoting personal and interpersonal well-being.

However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectWe attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r=0.234,p<0.001.Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectMusic-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied responses to musical experience detected by human bio-feedback brain features in a Geminoid augmented architecture - ScienceDirectThis paper presents the conceptual framework for a study of musical experience and the associated architecture centred on Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHI). On the grounds of the theoretical and experimental literature on the biological foundation of music, the grammar of music perception and the perception and feeling of emotions in music hearing, we argue that music cognition is specific and that it is realized by a cognitive capacity for music that consists of conceptual and affective constituents. We discuss the relationship between such constituents that enables understanding, that is extracting meaning from music at the different levels of the organization of sounds that are felt as bearers of affects and emotions. To account for the way such cognitive mechanisms are realized in music hearing and extended to movements and gestures we bring in the construct of tensions and of music experience as a cognitive frame. Finally, we describe the principled approach to the design and the architecture of a BCI-controlled robotic system that can be employed to map and specify the constituents of the cognitive capacity for music as well as to simulate their contribution to music meaning understanding in the context of music experience by displaying it through the Geminoid robot movements.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectPrevious research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed.Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectA cognitive/constructive view of music is put forth that diverges from traditional conceptions of music (e.g., music as sound; music as behavior; music as communication). The present view attempts to be compatible with the evidence of historic style changes that have occurred in the notated repertory of Western music. Two levels of cognitive processing are proposed: processes on the level of particular styles (germane to a certain period, culture, or community) and processes that are generic, universal, or cross-stylistic. Twelve such generic processes are described in detail. Several problems in the research stemming from earlier definitions of music are explored. In particular, attention is given to the artifacts of theoretical analysis (e.g., scales, chords, and discrete pitches) and their influence on music-psychological research.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectCognition in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in music - ScienceDirectThe development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectIn the field of psychology, the first studies in experimental aesthetics were conducted approximately 140 years ago. Since then, research has mainly concentrated on aesthetic responses to visual art. Both the aesthetic experience of music and, especially, its development have received rather limited attention. Moreover, until now, very little attention has been paid to the investigation of the aesthetic experience of music using neuroscientific methods. Aesthetic experiences are multidimensional and include inter alia sensory, perceptual, affective, and cognitive components. Aesthetic processes are usually experienced as pleasing and rewarding and are, thus, important and valuable experiences for many people. Because of their multidimensional nature, these processes employ several brain areas. In the present review, we examine important psychological and neural mechanisms that are believed to contribute to the development of aesthetic experiences of music. We also discuss relevant research findings. With the present review, we wish to provoke further discussion and possible future investigations as we consider the investigation of aesthetic experiences to be important both scientifically and with respect to potential clinical applications.The development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectThe development of aesthetic responses to music and their underlying neural and psychological mechanisms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the study was to find out the extent to which Slovenian general education teachers follow the principles of a balanced music objectives planning in the prevailing affective, psychomotor and cognitive domains. The research sample involves 372 Slovenian student and current general education teachers who, working in pairs, prepared 186 lesson plans for music education. The research results showed that the majority of the musical objectives planned in this study, pertained to the psychomotor domain, followed by the cognitive objectives and by the least represented objectives of the affective domain.Analysis of Music Education Objectives in Learning Domains - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectHumans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectIn order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectThis scoping review summarises and characterises current research that examines the relationship between anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units and participation in planned musical activities.A scoping review of music and anxiety, depression and agitation in older people with dementia in residential facilities and specialist care units - ScienceDirectFive databases were searched.

It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.Neural responses to nostalgia-evoking music modeled by elements of dynamic musical structure and individual differences in affective traits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectThe Evolutionary Origins of Rhythm: A Top-down/bottom-up Approach to Temporal Patterning in Music and Language - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Timing and Time Perception.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectInfluence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion is not influenced by the music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectPrior fatigue reduces performance and listening to music cannot reverse this effect.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music seems draw the attentional focus away from internal sensations of fatigue.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectListening to music distracted feelings of fatigue, but the decision to finish the exercise is based on RPE.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectWe examined the effects of listening to music on time to exhaustion and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise performed in fatigued and non-fatigued conditions.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectFourteen healthy men performed moderate-intensity exercise (60% Wmax) until exhaustion under four different conditions: with and without pre-fatigue (induced by 100 drop jumps) and listening and not listening to music.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectTime to exhaustion was lower in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition regardless listening to music. Similarly, RPE was higher in the fatigued than the non-fatigued condition, but music had no effect. On the other hand, listening to music decreased the associative thoughts regardless of fatigue status. Heart rate was not influenced by any treatment.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectThese results suggest that listening to music changes attentional focus but is not able to reverse fatigue-derived alteration of performance.Influence of music on performance and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercise preceded by fatigue - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of music on metabolism - ScienceDirectThe impact of music on metabolism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of music on metabolism - ScienceDirectMs. Yamasaki and Ms. Booker contributed equally to this work.Hearing and music in dementia - ScienceDirectMusic is a complex acoustic signal that relies on a number of different brain and cognitive processes to create the sensation of hearing. Changes in hearing function are generally not a major focus of concern for persons with a majority of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). However, changes in the processing of sounds may be an early, and possibly preclinical, feature of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this chapter is to review the current state of knowledge concerning hearing and music perception in persons who have a dementia as a result of a neurodegenerative disease. The review focuses on both peripheral and central auditory processing in common neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on the processing of music and other non-verbal sounds. The chapter also reviews music interventions used for persons with neurodegenerative diseases.Hearing and music in dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Semantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectSemantic annotation of digital music - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFinding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectWe used speech-to-song illusions to assess pitch perception in music and language.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectIllusions allowed us to hold acoustic characteristics constant for speech and song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectListeners were better at detecting musically unexpected pitch changes than expected.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectThis pattern was only evident when stimuli were perceived to transform to song.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectPitch processing is influenced by domain-specific knowledge, not just acoustics.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectFew studies comparing music and language processing have adequately controlled for low-level acoustical differences, making it unclear whether differences in music and language processing arise from domain-specific knowledge, acoustic characteristics, or both. We controlled acoustic characteristics by using the speech-to-song illusion, which often results in a perceptual transformation to song after several repetitions of an utterance. Participants performed a same-different pitch discrimination task for the initial repetition (heard as speech) and the final repetition (heard as song). Better detection was observed for pitch changes that violated rather than conformed to Western musical scale structure, but only when utterances transformed to song, indicating that music-specific pitch representations were activated and influenced perception. This shows that music-specific processes can be activated when an utterance is heard as song, suggesting that the high-level status of a stimulus as either language or music can be behaviorally dissociated from low-level acoustic factors.Finding the music of speech: Musical knowledge influences pitch processing in speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectDiffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectThe neuroplasticity effects of music-cued motor training were investigated.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectParticipants completed left-handed motor training with or without musical cues.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectBilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) microstructure was compared pre and post training.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectLeft-handed music-cued motor training increased fractional anisotropy in right AF.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectAuditory cues promoted rapid microstructural change in task-relevant pathways.Diffusion tensor MRI tractography reveals increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in arcuate fasciculus following music-cued motor training - ScienceDirectTreatment and prevention of music performance anxiety - ScienceDirectTreatment and prevention of music performance anxiety - ScienceDirectIn order to avoid severe MPA, prevention in the field of music pedagogic is very important.

In particular, there has been no detailed analysis of musical influences on emotions and cravings among clients in treatment and how these influences might occur. To explore these questions, surveys of music experiences were collected from 143 clients undergoing treatment (37 private hospital clients and 106 residential rehabilitation clients). Of the hospital sample, 70% listened to music for over an hour each day, typically while alone, and their preferred genres were pop and rock. Clients stated that music listening intensified the emotional experience of drug taking and vice versa. Residential rehabilitation clients reported that their preferred music was gloomier or heavier when using substances than when in recovery. Forty-three percent said that particular music increased their urge to use substances, and there were five common explanations, including: the song was associated with past experiences of substance use; the song evoked emotions related to substance use; and the song contained lyrics about substance use. Nevertheless, most respondents believed that music was important to their recovery. The findings are considered in terms of their clinical implications.The influence of music on emotions and cravings in clients in addiction treatment: A study of two clinical samples - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectLife-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectMusic practice is known to have a positive impact on the cognition of older adults.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectWe examined the brain correlates of lifelong music practice in older musicians.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectMusicians and non-musicians underwent a go/nogo task while ERPs were recorded.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectWe found group differences in behavioral accuracy as well as N2 and P3 amplitudes.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectTherefore, music practice may increase resistance to cognitive aging.Life-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectLife-long music practice and executive control in older adults: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Franz Joseph Gall and music: the faculty and the bump - ScienceDirectFranz Joseph Gall and music: the faculty and the bump - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectCreating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectWe present a particle system to create real-time animations choreographed by music.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectA proof-of-concept implementation shows that is possible to observe visual patterns.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectThe visual patterns match the theme of the musical composition.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectUser studies also show a perceptual relation between music terms and visual patterns.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectUsage examples are visual appreciation, entertainment and composition support tool.Creating and evaluating a particle system for music visualization - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we present a simplified 3D particle system and fast translation algorithm we have designed and implemented to generate real-time animated particle emitter fountains choreographed by a classical music.

It must react in realtime to audio signals from musicians, according to a timed high-level requirement called mixed score, written in a domain specific language. Such goals imply strong requirements of temporal reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input, yet not much addressed by the computer music community.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectWe present the application of Model-Based Testing techniques and tools to a state-of-the-art IMS, including in particular: offline and on-the-fly approaches for the generation of relevant input data for testing (including timing values), with coverage criteria, the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to the semantics of a given mixed score, the black-box execution of the test data on the System Under Test and the production of a verdict. Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectThis work has been partly supported by a DGA-MRIS scholarship and the project Inedit (ANR-12-CORD-009).Model-based testing for building reliable realtime interactive music systems - ScienceDirectDGA Direction Generale de l'Armement (French national defense).Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectPerceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceptions of Brain Health and Cognition in Older African Americans and Caucasians With HIV: A Focus Group Study - ScienceDirectDavid E.

As a result, there is no guidance for applying theoretical frameworks or for developing music therapy interventions for bullies and victims of bullying. After synthesizing the literature and determining the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and victims, the authors applied social learning theory as a framework to conceptualize the behaviors and cognitions of bullies and victims and to design age appropriate music therapy interventions. Based from concepts of social learning theory and existing music therapy research with adolescents, the authors provide suggestions of music therapy interventions for both bullies and victims. It seems that a social learning theory approach to music therapy interventions might represent an appropriate approach to frame treatments for both bullies and the victims of bullying. Prevention and intervention efforts at various age and developmental levels using music therapy may be more engaging, motivating, and effective than prevention and intervention efforts without music. The proposed interventions may be a helpful initiator for music therapists working with school-aged populations on the issues of bullying.Applying a social learning theoretical framework to music therapy as a prevention and intervention for bullies and victims of bullying - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring different approaches for music genre classification - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectRhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe show that respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectWe suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectArgue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectIn spite of its importance as a life-defining rhythmic movement and its constant rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the body, respiration has not received attention in Embodied Cognition (EC) literature. Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for EC, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements.Rhythms of the body, rhythms of the brain: Respiration, neural oscillations, and embodied cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBoth video games and music can increase physical excitement.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate a higher level than nonviolent video games.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThe excitement of background music interacts with game on aggression.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectViolent games generate more aggression regardless of pleasure level of music.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectBackground music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Background music matters: Why video games lead to increased aggressive behavior? - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Matthias Rauterberg.Design of Music Syllabi in Estonian and Finnish National Core Curricula for Comprehensive Schools - ScienceDirectThe fundamental document directing the teacher's action in music teaching on the comprehensive level is the music syllabus in national core curriculum.

The proposed Automated Composition for Music Education (ACME) software was developed to help the students to compose the rhythm and melody themselves, while chord configuration and arrangement are automatically generated. Subsequently, sixth-year students of a non-experimental school were recruited to use the software for the completion of its development. Analysis of learning effectiveness at the reaction level, analysis of learning-level learning effectiveness, correlation analysis of the reaction- and learning-levels learning effectiveness has been performed with a significant result. The correlations between each component of learning effectiveness at the reaction and learning levels were also found. Finally the students in the experimental group using the ACME teaching materials showed a better learning effectiveness at both reaction level and learning level, than those of the students in the comparison group.Learning effectiveness of applying automated music composition software in the high grades of elementary school - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dialogue Possibilities in Guided Autonomous music Studies in Class-teacher Education in Finland - ScienceDirectDialogue Possibilities in Guided Autonomous music Studies in Class-teacher Education in Finland - ScienceDirectThe Content Assessment of Pre-School Education Program in Turkey Towards Music Education - ScienceDirectThe pre-school period when the brain is developed the most rapidly forms a strong ground for the cognitive, language, motor, social and emotional development of the child. Therefore, children grow very quickly especially in their first six years of life which is named as the pre-school period and in these development areas, they become complete in every respect with an amazing speed. Thus, this will result in having the child achieve his/her own potential and be a productive member of the society. Education is the head of the most effective processes in shaping, directing, changing and developing individuals and societies. Contemporary education is carried out by being organised within a framework which includes the three general subject areas named as science, art and technique. As for music education, it forms one of the most important branches of fine arts education as an education of art having vocalic and auditory qualities. It has a significant place within pre-school education. In this context, the pre-school education program lastly prepared in 2013 in Turkey was studied and a content assessment was made directed towards music education in this research.The Content Assessment of Pre-School Education Program in Turkey Towards Music Education - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectEffects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectEffects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectImprovement only on tasks that involved executive control.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectFew differences between effects of the two training programs.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectDemonstrates power of short training to modify cognitive performance.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectSeparate lines of research have identified enhanced performance on nonverbal executive control (EC) tasks for bilinguals and those with music training, but little is known about the relation between them in terms of the specificity of the effects of each experience or the degree of exposure necessary to induce these changes. Using an intervention design, the current study pseudorandomly assigned 57 4- to 6-year-old children (matched on age, maternal education, and cognitive scores) to a 20-day training program offering instruction in either music or conversational French. The test battery consisted of verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring EC. All children improved on these tasks following training with some training-specific differences. No changes were observed on background or working memory measures after either training, ruling out simple practice effects. Children in both groups had better scores on the most challenging condition of a grammaticality sentence judgment task in which it was necessary to ignore conflict introduced through misleading semantic content. Children in both training groups also showed better accuracy on the easier condition of a nonverbal visual search task at post-test, but children in the French training group also showed significant improvement on the more challenging condition of this task. These results are discussed in terms of emergent EC benefits of language and music training.Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Non-verbal Communication in Music Lessons - ScienceDirectIn our study, which we carried out with a group of primary-school children aged between six and nine, we were interested in how musical language is shaped through group improvisations. Narrative dimensions of improvisation were studied through activities of Orff-Schulwerk, the specific music-movement education approach which, apart from music activities, puts great emphasis on development of social competences. The research was designed as a phenomenological case study. The findings show that, contrary to Orff-Schulwerk premises, children had yet to learn musical language and how to use it. It also turned out that teacher's expectations regarding the use of non-verbal communication are inversely proportional to the successful use of musical language. In line with Orff-Schulwerk's principles, rhythm proved to be the primary musical language parameter, as it was through rhythm that children first reached the sensations of others and reflectively depicted events from everyday life.Non-verbal Communication in Music Lessons - ScienceDirectPeer-Review Under Responsibility of Academic World Education and Research Center.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectRethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectMusicality persists in dementia as documented in empirical and popular sources.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectDominant approaches to understanding this phenomenon emphasize cognition.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectEmbodiment as a potential source of agency has been neglected in discourse on music.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectA relational model of citizenship offers a critical perspective on musicality.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectThis underscores the ethical imperative to more fully support musicality in dementia.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectWith the biomedicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of dementia, music programs, as with other arts- and leisure-based programs, have primarily been implemented as non-pharmacological means to generate social and behavioural changes. We argue that understanding and fully supporting the musicality of persons living with dementia requires engagement with citizenship discourse. Specifically we draw on a model of relational citizenship that recognizes that corporeality is a fundamental source of self-expression, interdependence, and reciprocal engagement. We articulate this argument with reference to the musicality of two residents living with dementia in long-term residential care; one example is drawn from an ethnographic study of selfhood in dementia and the other is from a study of elder-clowning. Relational citizenship brings a new and critical dimension to the discourse on music, ageing, and the body in contemporary society. It further highlights the ethical imperative to fully support musicality through institutional policies, structures and practices.Rethinking musicality in dementia as embodied and relational - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectInteracting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectInteracting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Interacting with the Music Paint Machine: Relating the constructs of flow experience and presence - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Giuseppe Riva.Cognition and contemporary music.: Commentary on musical emotions by L.

We reasoned that consumer characteristics such as one's gender and Need for Cognition (NFC) can affect which meaning(s) of ad background music people use when forming product perceptions. Yet, are such meanings and their use unique to music, or could they extend to other forms of aesthetics? Two studies explore these issues, revealing parallel outcomes when background materials contain either music or graphic art designs: high (low) NFC males are sensitive to only referential (embodied) meaning, whereas females use both meanings.Gender differences in the meanings consumers infer from music and other aesthetic stimuli - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Gender differences in the meanings consumers infer from music and other aesthetic stimuli - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectModels for temporal processing often assume rhythmic mechanisms.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition are an emerging theme in perception and attention.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectRhythms for cognition can either be spontaneous or stimulus driven.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectWe discuss temporal processing in the context of rhythms for cognition.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectTime is often thought to consist of units that cycle rhythmically at different scales (seconds, hours, days, seasons). Accordingly, many models for mechanisms of timing implement rhythmic processes as the neural and cognitive substrate of time. In recent years, neuronal as well as cognitive exploration have revealed rhythmic motifs in the mechanisms governing attention and perception. In this review, we offer a taxonomy for different rhythmic motifs for cognition and explore the utility of this taxonomy in guiding the study of temporal processes.Rhythms for cognition: the case of temporal processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThe Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectWe propose that the expressive power of human thought derives from a computational system we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectUGF is a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThe language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domainsThe Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectThis view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectMany have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence.The Universal Generative Faculty: The source of our expressive power in language, mathematics, morality, and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectReview of recent developments in mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI)Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectTheoretical background on embodied brain dynamicsImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectOverview on restrictions of established imaging methodsImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectSummary of hardware and software tools for MoBIImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectImaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Imaging natural cognition in action - ScienceDirectThis work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research to D.F.

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom. Our results indicate that ECG, motion, and glance measurements could be particularly suitable for the investigation of collaborative music making.Using affective and behavioural sensors to explore aspects of collaborative music making - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Using affective and behavioural sensors to explore aspects of collaborative music making - ScienceDirectThis paper has been recommended for acceptance by Henrik Iskov Christensen.The Impact of Cognitive Intervention Program and Music Therapy in Learning Disabilities - ScienceDirectThe aim of this experimental study is to evaluate the impact of Cognitive Intervention Program for Children with Learning Disabilities in collaboration with music therapy. This research consisted from 12 participants, children with ages differing between 6 - 7 years. Cognitive Intervention Program in collaboration with music therapy has been applied to 6 children that are in the experimental group. Other 6 children in the control group received only Cognitive Intervention Program, that was developed based on PASS theory. CAS test on two groups of children was performed after the interventions. The CAS total final test scores, suggests that experimental group resulted with significant difference from control group, p=, 002. Based on the findings of this study it can be suggested that interconnection of Music Therapy with Cognitive Intervention Program enables children with learning disability to be a step ahead in four problem areas, since intervention in these areas is twofold and can cover weaknesses of each other.The Impact of Cognitive Intervention Program and Music Therapy in Learning Disabilities - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Academic World Education and Research Center.The cerebellum and cognition - ScienceDirectThe most important function of the cerebellum may be to coordinate motor function so that movements can be performed smoothly, but there are others.

How does the brain produce creative thought? A series of recently published papers has begun to provide insight into this question, reporting a strikingly similar pattern of brain activity and connectivity across a range of creative tasks and domains, from divergent thinking to poetry composition to musical improvisation. This research suggests that creative thought involves dynamic interactions of large-scale brain systems, with the most compelling finding being that the default and executive control networks, which can show an antagonistic relation, tend to cooperate during creative cognition and artistic performance. These findings have implications for understanding how brain networks interact to support complex cognitive processes, particularly those involving goal-directed, self-generated thought.Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stay Creative! - Maintaining Individual Potential through Music Education - ScienceDirecthi contemporary education an interest on musical creativity and improvisation has steadily increased.

Across different cultures and eras they have been utilized for work, show, cultural rituals, consumption, therapy, and companionship and continue to serve in many of these roles today. As one of the most commonly trained domestic animals, understanding how horses learn and how their relationship with humans and other horses impacts their ability to learn has implications for horse welfare, training, husbandry and management. Given that unlike dogs and cats, domesticated horses have evolved from prey animals, the horse-human relationship poses interesting and unique scientific questions of theoretical value. There is still much to be learned about the cognition and behaviour of horses from a scientific perspective. This review explores current research within three related areas of horse cognition: human-horse interactions, social learning and independent learning in horses. Research on these topics is summarized and suggestions for future research are provided.Cognition and learning in horses (Equus caballus): What we know and why we should ask more - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Time flies with music whatever its emotional valence - ScienceDirectTime flies with music whatever its emotional valence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectImpact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectModel the effects of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectGovernment policy affects environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectRevisit reason moderates the relationship between policy and visitor loyalty.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectRevisit reason moderates the relationship between policy and environment.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectOccupation type moderates the relationship between policy and environment.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectTourists' repeat patronage is a prerequisite for sustainable festivals. Past studies have examined tourist cognition, affection, and conation to festivals. Government involvement in festivals has increased during the past decade; however, few studies have examined how government policy and environment quality influence visitor loyalty to festivals. Using sample data collected from 931 visitors during spring music festivals held in Southern Taiwan, this study used a structural equation model (SEM) with latent variables to examine these influences. The results suggest that government policy positively influences perceived environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty to festivals. Furthermore, the results from a multigroup SEM approach reveal that tourists' revisit reason (revisit festival versus other) and occupation type (student versus nonstudent) moderate the relationships between government policy and festival loyalty. Implications on festival planning and government policymaking are discussed.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of government policy and environment quality on visitor loyalty to Taiwan music festivals: Moderating effects of revisit reason and occupation type - ScienceDirectYao-Kuei Lee is an associate professor in the Department of Marketing & Distribution Management at Tajen University, PingTung, Taiwan, ROC.

In this regard, the present study developed a WM test with nonverbal sounds and compared it to the conventional verbal WM test. A total of twenty-five, non-music major, right-handed college students were presented with four different types of sounds (words, syllables, pitches, timbres) that varied from two to eight digits in length. Both accuracy and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) were measured. The results showed significant effects of number of targets on accuracy and sound type on oxyHb. A further analysis showed prefrontal asymmetry with pitch being processed by the right hemisphere (RH) and timbre by the left hemisphere (LH). These findings suggest a potential for employing musical sounds (i.e., pitch and timbre) as a complementary stimuli for conventional nonverbal WM tests, which can additionally examine its asymmetrical roles in the prefrontal regions.Nonverbal auditory working memory: Can music indicate the capacity? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectEmotional preference of people from different ethnicity would alter multimedia implicit tagging remarkably. It can be speculated that the people from each ethnic group would prefer the folk music of their own ethnicity more than the others. An emotionally intelligent system based on electroencephalography (EEG) is proposed in this study to test this hypothesis. Four channels of EEG signals of 16 healthy subjects from different ethnic groups were recorded during 4 two-minute long excerpts of folk music. Six types of features extracted and a subset of them were selected based on minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The top-ranked features were fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with various similarity metrics. The performance of the proposed method was assessed in terms of F1-score and accuracy (ACC) using random sub-sampling cross validation scheme. The highest performance for the single SVM classifier was achieved by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based RBF kernel which was significantly higher than the chance level. These results approve that the tendency of people from each ethnic group to their ethnicity is significantly reflected in their EEG signals which can be automatically detected.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of folk music preference of people from different ethnic groups using kernel-based methods on EEG signals - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.We perceive music before we understand speech - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectTo conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current studies to determine whether music therapy affects the cognitive function of older people.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThe Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectMusic therapy intervention offered in nursing homes, hospitals, or communities.The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThe Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectCognitive outcome domains were analyzed in a systematic review.

In both studies, the researchers conducted a series of active group music therapy interventions (lyric analysis, songwriting, music game, facilitated percussion interventions, and singalong) and passive group music listening sessions (recorded music via iPod) each for five days. During the first study, a higher percentage (15.53%) of patients on the unit attended the active music therapy sessions than the passive music listening sessions. Concerning treatment perceptions, participants in the active music therapy condition tended to have slightly higher mean perceptions of enjoyment and comfort than participants in the passive music listening condition. During the second study, participants spent more time in active music therapy sessions than in passive music listening sessions. Participants in the active music therapy condition also tended to have higher perceptions of helpfulness and amount learned concerning managing their mental illnesses than participants in the passive music listening condition. Results may have implications for funding psychiatric music therapy.

Much of spatial cognition research has focused on illuminating the domain-general processes (e.g. attention, memory, or representation) active in this domain-specific field. In this chapter, we suggest that researchers view this domain-general to domain-specific relationship in the opposite direction. In other words, we review spatial cognition research within the context of its utility for understanding domain-general processes. For a cognitive process to be domain-general, it should be evident across a wide variety of domain-specific tasks, including verbal and spatial ones. Yet, the majority of data supporting domain-general models comes from verbal tasks, such as list learning. Thus, we suggest that considering spatial cognition tasks and findings along with those from other domains would enhance our understanding of truly domain-general processing.The Cognition of Spatial Cognition: Domain-General within Domain-specific - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Shared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectWhile previous research has investigated the relationship either between language and music processing or between language and arithmetic processing, the present study investigated the relationship between music and arithmetic processing. Rule-governed number series, with the final number being a correct or incorrect series ending, were visually presented in synchrony with musical sequences, with the final chord functioning as the expected tonic or the less-expected subdominant chord (i.e., tonal function manipulation). Participants were asked to judge the correctness of the final number as quickly and accurately as possible. The results revealed an interaction between the processing of series ending and the processing of the task-irrelevant chords' tonal function, thus suggesting that music and arithmetic processing share cognitive resources. These findings are discussed in terms of general temporal and structural integration resources for linguistic and non-linguistic rule-governed sequences.Shared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectShared structural and temporal integration resources for music and arithmetic processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Listening to the calls of the wild: The role of experience in linking language and cognition in young infants - ScienceDirectListening to the calls of the wild: The role of experience in linking language and cognition in young infants - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectAnalysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectA novel music/speech analysis framework via integration of audio content and functional brain response.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectBrain response features are derived from fMRI data when participants are listening to the music/speech.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectA novel regression algorithm named ITGP is proposed to improve the quality in predicting functional brain response.Analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectAnalysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Influence of Progressive Rock Music on Motivation Regarding Personal Goals, Motivation Regarding Competition and Level of Aspiration on Young Students in Psychology - ScienceDirectThe study is focused on highlighting the influence of progressive rock music on motivation regarding personal goals, motivation regarding competition and level of aspiration at young students in psychology.

Previously, we have shown that Brodmann area 47 (BA47), a brain area associated with processing of language, is activated bilaterally when musicians tap the main meter in a polymetric context emphasizing a counter meter, suggesting that processing of metric elements in music relies on brain areas also involved in language processing. In that study, the tension was created entirely by changes in the stimulus while participants were tapping the main meter. Here we find left-hemispheric BA47 activation in response to a self-produced counter meter on top of a main meter provided by an ecological music excerpt. This data indicates that the activation is linked to polyrhythmic tension, regardless of whether it arises from the stimulus or the task.Tapping polyrhythms in music activates language areas - ScienceDirectTapping polyrhythms in music activates language areas - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Is there a domain-general cognitive structuring system? Evidence from structural priming across music, math, action descriptions, and language - ScienceDirectCognitive processing in many domains (e.g., sentence comprehension, music listening, and math solving) requires sequential information to be organized into an integrational structure. There appears to be some overlap in integrational processing across domains, as shown by cross-domain interference effects when for example linguistic and musical stimuli are jointly presented (Koelsch, Gunter, Wittfoth, & Sammler, 2005; Slevc, Rosenberg, & Patel, 2009). These findings support theories of overlapping resources for integrational processing across domains (cfr. SSIRH Patel, 2003; SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). However, there are some limitations to the studies mentioned above, such as the frequent use of unnaturalistic integrational difficulties. In recent years, the idea has risen that evidence for domain-generality in structural processing might also be yielded though priming paradigms (cfr. Scheepers, 2003). The rationale behind this is that integrational processing across domains regularly requires the processing of dependencies across short or long distances in the sequence, involving respectively less or more syntactic working memory resources (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010), and such processing decisions might persist over time. However, whereas recent studies have shown suggestive priming of integrational structure between language and arithmetics (though often dependent on arithmetic performance, cfr. Scheepers et al., 2011; Scheepers & Sturt, 2014), it remains to be investigated to what extent we can also find evidence for priming in other domains, such as music and action (cfr. SWM, Kljajevic, 2010). Experiment 1a showed structural priming from the processing of musical sequences onto the position in the sentence structure (early or late) to which a relative clause was attached in subsequent sentence completion. Importantly, Experiment 1b showed that a similar structural manipulation based on non-hierarchically ordered color sequences did not yield any priming effect, suggesting that the priming effect is not based on linear order, but integrational dependency. Finally, Experiment 2 presented primes in four domains (relative clause sentences, music, mathematics, and structured descriptions of actions), and consistently showed priming within and across domains. These findings provide clear evidence for domain-general structural processing mechanisms.Is there a domain-general cognitive structuring system?

Given that music is primarily an auditory phenomenon, it is reasonable to assume that the auditory cortex will play a major role in the representation of musical auditory scenes. The primary objective of this chapter was to survey the literature and perform a meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature in order to determine whether a delineation of the lateral temporal lobes emerges in terms of the processing of tonal, temporal, and timbral aspects of musical information. The meta-analysis revealed both overlapping and non-overlapping areas of auditory cortex, with a tendency for melodic and harmonic manipulations to activate areas outside the primary auditory cortex. Regions of the superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus rostral and ventral to the auditory cortex appear to play an important role in the perception of melodic intervals and patterns, and harmonies, but may not play a direct role in maintaining or evaluating higher-order tonal relationships that govern key membership or relationships between major and minor keys.Neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Learning music from collaboration - ScienceDirectI draw on two traditions of research: the social psychology of collaborative groups, and the ethnographic study of improvisational performance.

Mental rotation performance is the ability to rotate a three-dimensional object using the imagination. Three groups, each consisting of 40 students, and divided by the subjects, music, sports, and education, solved a psychometrical mental rotation task with three-dimensional block figures. The results showed a better mental rotation performance for music and sports students compared to the education students. Furthermore, the well known gender difference favoring males was found for both sports and education students but not for music students.Different mental rotation performance in students of music, sport and education - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectWhen self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectThe Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis is supported in six experiments.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectSocial norms entitle experts to be more closed-minded or dogmatic.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectSelf-perception of high expertise increases closed-mindedness.When self-perceptions of expertise increase closed-minded cognition: The earned dogmatism effect - ScienceDirectAlthough cultural values generally prescribe open-mindedness, open-minded cognition systematically varies across individuals and situations.

In addition, music processing in general is often considered spared by the neurodegenerative effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research examining these two phenomena is limited, and no work to our knowledge has explored the effectiveness of musical mnemonics in AD. The present study sought to investigate the effect of music at encoding on the subsequent recognition of associated verbal information. Lyrics of unfamiliar children's songs were presented bimodally at encoding, and visual stimuli were accompanied by either a sung or a spoken recording. Patients with AD demonstrated better recognition accuracy for the sung lyrics than the spoken lyrics, while healthy older adults showed no significant difference between the two conditions. We propose two possible explanations for these findings: first, that the brain areas subserving music processing may be preferentially spared by AD, allowing a more holistic encoding that facilitates recognition, and second, that music heightens arousal in patients with AD, allowing better attention and improved memory.Music as a memory enhancer in patients with Alzheimer's disease - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are left fronto-temporal brain areas a prerequisite for normal music-syntactic processing? - ScienceDirectAre left fronto-temporal brain areas a prerequisite for normal music-syntactic processing? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectThe vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectIn music, professionals cite sound as most important to performance evaluation.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectVisual information actually dominates the rapid judgment of group performance.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectParticipants are able to identify competition winners through silent videos.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectPredictions are no better than chance with sound or video plus sound recordings.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectPerformance judgment is driven by visual cues about group dynamics and leadership.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectTeam effectiveness and group performance are often defined by standards set by domain experts. Professional musicians consistently report that sound output is the most important standard for evaluating the quality of group performance in the domain of music. However, across six studies, visual information dominated rapid judgments of group performance. Participants (1062 experts and novices) were able to select the actual winners of live ensemble competitions and distinguish top-ranked orchestras from non-ranked orchestras based on 6-s silent video recordings yet were unable to do so from sound recordings or recordings with both video and sound. These findings suggest that judgments of group performance in the domain of music are driven at least in part by visual cues about group dynamics and leadership.The vision heuristic: Judging music ensembles by sight alone - ScienceDirectThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations.

The impact of affects, senses, and cognition - ScienceDirectProduct experience is shaped by the interaction between the human systems and the product. Human systems include a sensory system to perceive the surrounding world, an affective system that evokes emotional responses to certain stimuli, and a cognitive system that makes meaning and processes information. We hypothesise that experience is a combination between these three systems rather than a linear continuum of hedonic reactions. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a study measuring the experience of drinking craft and industrial beers. A total of 400 consumers were invited to drink beer, rate their liking and select a set of phrases that better described their drinking experience. Results showed no significant difference in expected liking and purchase intention between the eight beers evaluated. However, a difference between beers was observed for the CATA phrases. Cognitive phrases were more frequently checked for craft beers, while sensory, and affective phrases were more frequently checked for industrial beers. A Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables showed that the sensory and cognitive systems were more related to liking than the affective system.Measuring the drinking experience of beer in real context situations.

Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.The rewards of music listening: Response and physiological connectivity of the mesolimbic system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectFunding: None.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectConflict of Interest: None.Music as Medicine - ScienceDirectAuthorship: The author had access to the data and played a role in writing this manuscript.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectEmbodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectMusical instruction integrates conceptual information in multimodal viewpoints.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectSuch viewpoints exploit speech, visuospatial gesture and the performing body.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectMultimodal viewpoints need to consider material artefacts and embodiment.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectThe corpus exploits authentic music instruction in a trumpet master class.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectThis paper analyzes how an instructor in a trumpet master class exploits multimodal viewpoints while addressing sound in verbal and/or visuospatial terms in order to conceptualize the interpretation of a piece of music. We show how musical meaning emerges as both an abstract and locally situated, embodied discursive activity, in which speech is connected with metaphorical hand gestures and the material world. Multimodality of musical meaning involves not only abstract gesture and speech about musical ideas, but also implies the concrete use of material objects and actions, such as the instrument, the (breathing) body of the trumpet player, as well as reference to the musical score. Viewpoint is a central issue in this conceptual process: both teacher and student constantly put themselves in the shoes of the performer, simultaneously abstracting over and embodying both their own and the other's body-in-music as they perform and both verbally and gesturally address past and future trumpet playing.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied musical meaning-making and multimodal viewpoints in a trumpet master class - ScienceDirectPaul Sambre is an assistant professor of discourse studies and Italian linguistics at the University of Leuven.

Wellness in part includes an individual's positive attitude towards, and active engagement in the health environment in which they function. A focus of wellness can include techniques and methods that people can use in their lives to combat stress and facilitate relaxation. Music as a sound medium has been used as part of wellness programs in a variety of ways, including as a sonic background for relaxation experiences. In this article, the role of music listening to positively affect neurophysiological and emotional responses related to relaxation is examined. Neurological bases of music listening and sound processing are reviewed, with emphasis on how music is processed by the limbic and related biological systems, including endocrine and hormonal responses. Suggestions for how consumers may use music listening in their own wellness and relaxation regimens are provided, including descriptions of which music to consider, where to obtain it, and how to use it.Music listening to facilitate relaxation and promote wellness: Integrated aspects of our neurophysiological responses to music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Mediating Effects of Positive Cognitions on Autism Caregivers' Depression and Their Children's Challenging Behaviors - ScienceDirectCaregivers of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are prone to depression and psychological problems, which have an impact on their children's challenging behaviors. Positive cognitions include specific positive thinking patterns that enhance one's ability to effectively manage daily activities and promote mental health. The purpose of this research is to test the mediating effects of positive cognitions on the relationship between caregivers' depression and their children's challenging behaviors among 117 caregivers of persons with ASD. Positive cognitions were found to have mediating effects on the relationship between caregiver's depression and their children's challenging behaviors in this sample of caregivers of persons with ASD. Nurses are in a strategic position to include in their interventions those strategies that strengthen positive cognitions in order to improve the caregivers' positive cognitions and well-being, which, in turn will have an impact on their children's challenging behaviors.The Mediating Effects of Positive Cognitions on Autism Caregivers' Depression and Their Children's Challenging Behaviors - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectA model of online consumer behavior incorporating emotions, cognitions, flow, entertainment, online attitudes and purchase intentions was developed and tested, as well as the moderating effects of need for cognition (NFC) and optimum stimulation level (OSL). Cognitions relate to website functional characteristics, while entertainment relates to its hedonic characteristics. Emotions encompass pleasure, arousal and dominance. Findings indicate that in the context of online visiting, emotions precede cognitions. Among other findings, the dimension of dominance played a major role in the model. The moderating effects of NFC and OSL on the model were tested individually as well as the interactive effects of these moderators. Strong main and interactive effects of NFC and OSL were found. Several key differential paths were identified. Finally, the article provides a description of website visitors based on these personality variables.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling online consumer behavior: Preeminence of emotions and moderating influences of need for cognition and optimal stimulation level - ScienceDirectAn Architectural Symphony: Fusing Disabilities with Music - ScienceDirectThis paper aims to uncover the creative music potentials of disabled youths in Malaysia.

Here, we investigate these neural mechanisms by applying a well-defined painful stimulus while participants listened to their favorite music or to no music. Neural responses in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord were mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging spanning the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Subjective pain ratings were observed to be significantly lower when pain was administered with music than without music. The pain stimulus without music elicited neural activity in brain regions that are consistent with previous studies. Brain regions associated with pleasurable music listening included limbic, frontal, and auditory regions, when comparing music to non-music pain conditions. In addition, regions demonstrated activity indicative of descending pain modulation when contrasting the 2 conditions. These regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, periaqueductal gray matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord. This is the first imaging study to characterize the neural response of pain and how pain is mitigated by music, and it provides new insights into the neural mechanism of music-induced analgesia within the central nervous system.Music Modulation of Pain Perception and Pain-Related Activity in the Brain, Brain Stem, and Spinal Cord: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study - ScienceDirectThis article presents the first investigation of neural processes underlying music analgesia in human participants.

This harmonic priming effect occurs for fine syntactic-like changes in context and is observed irrespective of the extent of participants' musical expertise (Bigand & Pineau, Perception and Psychophysics, 59 (1997) 1098). The present study investigates how the harmonic context influences the processing of phonemes in vocal music. Eight-chord sequences were presented to participants. The four notes of each chord were played with synthetic phonemes and participants were required to quickly decide whether the last chord (the target) was sung on a syllable containing the phoneme /i/ or /u/. The musical relationship of the target chord to the previous context was manipulated so that the target chord acted as a referential tonic chord or as a congruent but less structurally important subdominant chord. Phoneme monitoring was faster for the tonic chord than for the subdominant chord. This finding has several implications for music cognition and speech perception. It also suggests that musical and phonemic processing interact at some stage of processing.The effect of harmonic context on phoneme monitoring in vocal music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music in dreams - ScienceDirectMusic in dreams is rarely reported in scientific literature, while the presence of musical themes in dreams of famous musicians is anecdotally reported. We did a systematic investigation to evaluate whether the occurrence of musical dreams could be related to musical competence and practice, and to explore specific features of dreamt pieces. Thirty-five professional musicians and thirty non-musicians filled out a questionnaire about the characteristics of their musical activity and a structured dream log on the awakening for 30 consecutive days. Musicians dream of music more than twice with respect to non-musicians; musical dreams frequency is related to the age of commencement of musical instruction, but not to the daily load of musical activity. Nearly half of the recalled music was non-standard, suggesting that original music can be created in dreams.Music in dreams - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.VirSchool: The effect of background music and immersive display systems on memory for facts learned in an educational virtual environment - ScienceDirectVirSchool: The effect of background music and immersive display systems on memory for facts learned in an educational virtual environment - ScienceDirectVirSchool: The effect of background music and immersive display systems on memory for facts learned in an educational virtual environment - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectAlthough a substantial number of research projects have addressed music information retrieval over the past three decades, the field is still very immature. Few of these projects involve complex (polyphonic) music; methods for evaluation are at a very primitive stage of development; none of the projects tackles the problem of realistically large-scale databases. Many problems to be faced are due to the nature of music itself. Among these are issues in human perception and cognition of music, especially as they concern the recognizability of a musical phrase. This paper considers some of the most fundamental problems in music information retrieval, challenging the common assumption that searching on pitch (or pitch-contour) alone is likely to be satisfactory for all purposes. This assumption may indeed be true for most monophonic (single-voice) music, but it is certainly inadequate for polyphonic (multi-voice) music. Even in the monophonic case it can lead to misleading results. The fact, long recognized in projects involving monophonic music, that a recognizable passage is usually not identical with the search pattern means that approximate matching is almost always necessary, yet this too is severely complicated by the demands of polyphonic music. Almost all text-IR methods rely on identifying approximate units of meaning, that is, words. A fundamental problem in music IR is that locating such units is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Problems of music information retrieval in the real world - ScienceDirectThis material is based on work supported in part by the Digital Libraries Initiative, Phase 2, under NSF grant IIS-9905842, by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee under project code JCDE/NSFKCL, and by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC-9209623.

In order to investigate how these different facets of perfectionism are related to coping, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in musicians, we asked 275 professional and amateur Japanese musicians to complete measures of perfectionism traits, perfectionism cognitions, coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. While both facets of perfectionism showed a similar pattern of correlation with coping measures, they were differently associated with effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis showed the incremental validity of perfectionism cognitions in explaining variance in performance anxiety above the variance explained by other variables, such as trait perfectionism. These findings demonstrate that perfectionism in musicians has both positive and negative elements.Traits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians - ScienceDirectTraits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Moderating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectResting state networks (RSNs) are spontaneous, synchronous, low-frequency oscillations observed in the brains of subjects who are awake but at rest. A particular RSN called the default mode network (DMN) has been shown to exhibit changes associated with neurological disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have also found that differing experimental conditions such as eyes-open versus eyes-closed can produce measurable changes in the DMN. These condition-associated changes have the potential of confounding the measurements of changes in RSNs related to or caused by disease state(s). In this study, we use fMRI measurements of resting-state connectivity paired with EEG measurements of alpha rhythm and employ independent component analysis, undirected graphs of partial spectral coherence, and spatiotemporal regression to investigate the effect of music-listening on RSNs and the DMN in particular. We observed similar patterns of DMN connectivity in subjects who were listening to music compared with those who were not, with a trend toward a more introspective pattern of resting-state connectivity during music-listening. We conclude that music-listening is a valid condition under which the DMN can be studied.Moderating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectModerating effects of music on resting state networks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perinatal exposure to music protects spatial memory against callosal lesions - ScienceDirectSeveral studies have indicated that the exposure of rodents to music modulates brain development and neuroplasticity, by mechanisms that involve facilitated hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotrophin synthesis and glutamatergic signaling. This study focused on the potential protection that the perinatal exposure to music, between postnatal days 2 and 32, could offer against functional deficits induced by neonatal callosotomy in rats. The spontaneous alternation and marble-burying behaviors were longitudinally measured in callosotomized and control rats that had been exposed to music or not. The results indicated that the neonatal callosotomy-induced spontaneous alternation deficits that became apparent only after postnatal day 45, about the time when the rat corpus callosum reaches its maximal levels of myelination. The perinatal exposure to music efficiently protected the spontaneous alternation performance against the deficits induced by callosotomy. The present findings may offer important insights into music-induced neuroplasticity, relevant to brain development and neurorehabilitation.Perinatal exposure to music protects spatial memory against callosal lesions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats - ScienceDirectDuring the prenatal period, the development of individual is influenced by the environmental factors. In the present study, the influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats was investigated. The exposure to the noise during pregnancy caused growth retardation, decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and impaired spatial learning ability in pups. The exposure to music during pregnancy, on the other hand, caused increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and enhanced spatial learning ability in pups. The present study has shown the importance of the prenatal environmental conditions for the cognition and brain development.Influence of prenatal noise and music on the spatial memory and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of developing rats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical structure modulates semantic priming in vocal music - ScienceDirectMusical structure modulates semantic priming in vocal music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Expert music performance: cognitive, neural, and developmental bases - ScienceDirectExpert music performance: cognitive, neural, and developmental bases - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectEffects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy can be effective treatment for blood and marrow transplant patients.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectCognitive-behavioral music therapy may be an effective treatment concerning multidimensional aspects of fatigue.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectExperimental participants had more favorable scores than control participants.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectPatient-preferred live music can be an effective intervention on fatigue.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectQualitative results support cognitive-behavioral music therapy with patients on a blood and marrow unit.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectEffects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of cognitive-behavioral music therapy on fatigue in patients in a blood and marrow transplantation unit: A mixed-method pilot study - ScienceDirectPostal address: University of Minnesota, School of Music, 100 Ferguson Hall, 2106 4th Street South, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

Here we address the possibility that creative cognition is a function of dopaminergic modulation in fronto-striatal brain circuitries. It is proposed that (i) creative cognition benefits from both flexible and persistent processing, (ii) striatal dopamine and the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is associated with flexible processing, while (iii) prefrontal dopamine and the integrity of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway is associated with persistent processing. We examine this possibility in light of studies linking creative ideation, divergent thinking, and creative problem-solving to polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes, indirect markers and manipulations of the dopaminergic system, and clinical populations with dysregulated dopaminergic activity. Combined, studies suggest a functional differentiation between striatal and prefrontal dopamine: moderate (but not low or high) levels of striatal dopamine benefit creative cognition by facilitating flexible processes, and moderate (but not low or high) levels of prefrontal dopamine enable persistence-driven creativity.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creative cognition and dopaminergic modulation of fronto-striatal networks: Integrative review and research agenda - ScienceDirectThis work was facilitated by a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-451-12-023) to Matthijs Baas.Effect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectEffect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of Music on Pain for Home-Dwelling Persons with Dementia - ScienceDirectSupported by Sigma Theta Tau International Gamma Chapter and by a University of Iowa College of Nursing Research Grant Award.Music as a Therapeutic Intervention on an Inpatient Neuroscience Unit - ScienceDirectMusic as a Therapeutic Intervention on an Inpatient Neuroscience Unit - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectEnvironmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectMobile devices enable ubiquitous working in multiple, varying environments.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectExploring a virtual environment affects work performance.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectBeing in a work-related context leads to a more risky decision-making behaviour.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectBeing in a work-related context enhances efficiency in a concentration task.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectThe term ubiquitous working describes the relocation from working in a traditional office on company premises to flexible working in the home or in other environments that were never originally conceptualized for working, such as parks or hotel lobbies. Research indicates that the environment has the potential to influence work performance. We used virtual 3D environments to examine the impact of a work-related (characteristic office) vs. a non-work related context (Tuscan garden) on attention, concentration, and decision making. We assumed that the context would influence cognitive performance. Our results showed that, compared to the non-work context, participants in the work context (1) had marginally faster reaction times in an attentional task (2) were more accurate in completing a concentration test, and (3) made decisions that were more risky. These results suggest that working in a more typical work environment enhances work performance and influences decision making.Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectRecent brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the human mirror system, in addition to becoming active while viewing the actions of others, also responds to abstract visual and auditory stimuli associated with specific actions. Here, we test the hypothesis that when musicians read sheet music an associated motor act is automatically recruited in the same way as when we observe the actions of others.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectUsing EEG, we measured event related desynchronization of the sensorimotor mu rhythm (mu-ERD) while musicians and non-musicians listened to music, observed movies of a musical instrument being played and observed a static image of the corresponding sheet music.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectMusicians showed significantly greater mu-ERD than non-musicians when observing sheet music and musical performances.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectOur results demonstrate that the human motor system aids in the process of perception and understanding by forming functional links between arbitrary, abstract percepts and associated acts.Reading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectReading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectReading sheet music facilitates sensorimotor mu-desynchronization in musicians - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music congruency in a service setting: The mediating role of emotional and cognitive responses - ScienceDirectMusic congruency in a service setting: The mediating role of emotional and cognitive responses - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognitive, emotional, and neural benefits of musical leisure activities in aging and neurological rehabilitation: A critical review - ScienceDirectMusic has the capacity to engage auditory, cognitive, motor, and emotional functions across cortical and subcortical brain regions and is relatively preserved in aging and dementia. Thus, music is a promising tool in the rehabilitation of aging-related neurological illnesses, such as stroke and Alzheimer disease. As the population ages and the incidence and prevalence of these illnesses rapidly increases, music-based interventions that are enjoyable and effective in the everyday care of the patients are needed. In addition to formal music therapy, musical leisure activities, such as music listening and singing, which patients can do on their own or with a caregiver, are a promising way to support psychological well-being during aging and in neurological rehabilitation. This review article provides an overview of current evidence on the cognitive, emotional, and neural effects of musical leisure activities both during normal aging and in the rehabilitation and care of stroke patients and people with dementia.Cognitive, emotional, and neural benefits of musical leisure activities in aging and neurological rehabilitation: A critical review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Walking on music - ScienceDirectWalking on music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirectDysfunctional cognitions can contribute to depression and its maintenance. They may be related to a higher relapse rate and a longer duration of the depressive episode. The relevance of dysfunctional cognitions for acute inpatient treatment of unipolar depression is examined in this study and its variability by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).Dysfunctional cognitions of depressive inpatients and their relationship with treatment outcome - ScienceDirect222 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were evaluated during their inpatient treatment by assessing admission and discharge depression scores and their relationship to dysfunctional cognitions, using the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS).

Covert reciting of these syllable sequences along with percussion music aids active listeners in keeping track of music. Owing to the acoustic dissimilarity between the representative syllables and the referent percussive sounds, associative learning is necessary for the oral representation of percussion music. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural processes underlying oral rehearsals of music. There were four music conditions in the experiment: (1) passive listening to unlearned percussion music, (2) active listening to learned percussion music, (3) active listening to the syllable representation of (2), and (4) active listening to learned melodic music. Our results specified two neural substrates of the association mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music. First, information integration of heard sounds and the auditory consequences of subvocal rehearsals may engage the right planum temporale during active listening to percussion music. Second, mapping heard sounds to articulatory and laryngeal gestures may engage the left middle premotor cortex.Neural mechanisms involved in the oral representation of percussion music: An fMRI study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectExperience has shown that therapy using music for therapeutic purposes has certain effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (both functional and organic disorders). However, the mechanisms of action underlying music therapy remain unknown, and scientific clarification has not advanced.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectWhile that study disproved the Mozart effect, the effects of music on the human body and mind were not disproved. In fact, more scientific studies on music have been conducted in recent years, mainly in the field of neuroscience, and the level of interest among researchers is increasing. The results of past studies have clarified that music influences and affects cranial nerves in humans from fetus to adult. The effects of music at a cellular level have not been clarified, and the mechanisms of action for the effects of music on the brain have not been elucidated.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectWe propose that listening to music facilitates the neurogenesis, the regeneration and repair of cerebral nerves by adjusting the secretion of steroid hormones, ultimately leading to cerebral plasticity. Music affects levels of such steroids as cortisol (C), testosterone (T) and estrogen (E), and we believe that music also affects the receptor genes related to these substances, and related proteins.Music facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectMusic facilitate the neurogenesis, regeneration and repair of neurons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Individual differences in music performance - ScienceDirectIndividual differences in music performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceiving temporal regularity in music - ScienceDirectPerceiving temporal regularity in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Perceiving speech rhythm in music: Listeners classify instrumental songs according to language of origin - ScienceDirectPerceiving speech rhythm in music: Listeners classify instrumental songs according to language of origin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recognizing group cognition - ScienceDirectRecognizing group cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Organists and organ music composers - ScienceDirectClinical case reports of patients with exceptional musical talent and education provide clues as to how the brain processes musical ability and aptitude.

Functional neuroimaging and lesion studies show that music-evoked emotions can modulate activity in virtually all limbic and paralimbic brain structures. These structures are crucially involved in the initiation, generation, detection, maintenance, regulation and termination of emotions that have survival value for the individual and the species. Therefore, at least some music-evoked emotions involve the very core of evolutionarily adaptive neuroaffective mechanisms. Because dysfunctions in these structures are related to emotional disorders, a better understanding of music-evoked emotions and their neural correlates can lead to a more systematic and effective use of music in therapy.Towards a neural basis of music-evoked emotions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Elements of Mental Training in Music - ScienceDirectMental training typically takes place without an instrument or the physical act of playing, and focuses on a particular activity, a conscious guiding of that activity, as well as on incorporating an emotional experience of that activity. Previous research (Immonen, 2007) showed that both modes of practicing, mental as well as physical, involve three important elements: planning, realization, and evaluation of the practice. In music, mental training aims at the most ideally possible act of playing and the creation of a musical event. The research problem is to find out the pianist carries out the mental training. The research data was collected through the interviews of four highly talented pianists of the Sibelius Academy.Brain on music kills pain of workouts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music to my eyes: Cross-modal interactions in the perception of emotions in musical performance - ScienceDirectMusic to my eyes: Cross-modal interactions in the perception of emotions in musical performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of activity engagement in the relations between Openness/Intellect and cognition - ScienceDirectThe role of activity engagement in the relations between Openness/Intellect and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The structural neuroanatomy of music emotion recognition: Evidence from frontotemporal lobar degeneration - ScienceDirectDespite growing clinical and neurobiological interest in the brain mechanisms that process emotion in music, these mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) frequently exhibit clinical syndromes that illustrate the effects of breakdown in emotional and social functioning. Here we investigated the neuroanatomical substrate for recognition of musical emotion in a cohort of 26 patients with FTLD (16 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, bvFTD, 10 with semantic dementia, SemD) using voxel-based morphometry. On neuropsychological evaluation, patients with FTLD showed deficient recognition of canonical emotions (happiness, sadness, anger and fear) from music as well as faces and voices compared with healthy control subjects. Impaired recognition of emotions from music was specifically associated with grey matter loss in a distributed cerebral network including insula, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal and more posterior temporal and parietal cortices, amygdala and the subcortical mesolimbic system. This network constitutes an essential brain substrate for recognition of musical emotion that overlaps with brain regions previously implicated in coding emotional value, behavioural context, conceptual knowledge and theory of mind. Musical emotion recognition may probe the interface of these processes, delineating a profile of brain damage that is essential for the abstraction of complex social emotions.The structural neuroanatomy of music emotion recognition: Evidence from frontotemporal lobar degeneration - ScienceDirectSource localization of the effects of Persian classical music forms on the brain waves by QEEG - ScienceDirectThe aim of this study is investigation of the effects of Persian classical music forms on the brain waves and areas. Main tool was QEEG that registers brain waves. Independent variables include four classical music forms: Pishdaramad, Chaharmezrab, Reng and Avaz that their effects have been investigated on the 12 right handed subjects. The results indicated significant differences in the effects of Pishdaramad form on the theta band while it could affect on different brain areas in comparison with other music forms including the increase of activity in Superior Frontal Gyrus and Precentral Gyrus areas in comparison with noise and Avaz and decrease of activity on Postcentral Gyrus and Supramarginal Gyrus areas in comparison with Chaharmezrab and Reng. The results concluded from rhythmic changes in each of music forms. In other word the increase of rhythm speed can raise the brain activity. Also the results of this study shows important of frontal area during the processing of emotional music.Specific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectSpecific Music Therapy Techniques in the Treatment of Primary Headache Disorders in Adolescents: A Randomized Attention-Placebo-Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectThis article presents a randomized placebo-controlled trial on music therapy in the treatment of adolescents with frequent primary headache.

One distinctive characteristic for each group is theoretically hypothesized within the cognitive dissonance framework and empirically confirmed for both movie and music downloading: A more negative attitude towards newness distinguishes downloaders who never pay, a shorter Internet use history distinguishes downloaders who always pay, and participation in a greater breadth of online activities distinguishes eclectic downloaders. By contrast, neither demographics nor factors related to movie (music) interests help explain the differences among the groups of movie (music) downloaders. Both the theoretical framework and the empirical evidence might be used to improve the effectiveness of anti-piracy campaigns by adapting their messages to the specific characteristics and expected reactions of each group of downloaders.The payment dilemma in movie and music downloads: An explanation through cognitive dissonance theory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGenerality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectWe studied generalization of expertise to auditory perceptual and broader cognitive skills.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectMusician groups perceived auditory signal differences more finely than non-musicians.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectMusician groups differed in fine perception given a training-relevant context.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectMusical expertise did not strongly generalize to several cognitive measures (e.g., auditory scene analysis).Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectSustained attention predicted variance in fine perception of AM depth above expertise.Generality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGenerality and specificity in the effects of musical expertise on perception and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectThe effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of culture on perception and cognition: A conceptual framework - ScienceDirectThe authors gratefully acknowledge the suggestions and comments of two anonymous reviewers and the Special Issue Editor.Emotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectThis paper reviews the use of music as an adjuvant to the control of pain, especially in medical procedures. Surgery causes stress and anxiety that exacerbates the experience of pain. Self-report of and physiological measures on post-surgical patients indicate that music therapy or music stimulation reduces the perception of pain, both alone and when part of a multimodal pain management program, and can reduce the need for pharmaceutical interventions. However, multimodal pain therapy, including non-pharmacological interventions after surgery, is still rare in medical practice. We summarize how music can enhance medical therapies and can be used as an adjuvant with other pain-management programs to increase the effectiveness of those therapies. As summarized, we currently know that musical pieces chosen by the patient are commonly, but not always, more effective than pieces chosen by another person. Further research should focus both on finding the specific indications and contra-indications of music therapy and on the biological and neurological pathways responsible for those findings (related evidence has implicated brain opioid and oxytocin mechanisms in affective changes evoked by music). In turn, these findings will allow medical investigators and practitioners to design guidelines and reliable, standardized applications for this promising method of pain management in modern medicine.Emotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectEmotional foundations of music as a non-pharmacological pain management tool in modern medicine - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Social Cognition in Individuals With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: Recent Advances and Trends in Research - ScienceDirectSocial Cognition in Individuals With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: Recent Advances and Trends in Research - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThe role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThis synthesis of current research characterizes the functional roles of the PHC.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectContextual associative processing is proposed as the core function of this region.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThis proposal unifies findings for the PHC, creating convergence for future research.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectThe parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has been associated with many cognitive processes, including visuospatial processing and episodic memory. To characterize the role of PHC in cognition, a framework is required that unifies these disparate processes. An overarching account was proposed whereby the PHC is part of a network of brain regions that processes contextual associations. Contextual associations are the principal element underlying many higher-level cognitive processes, and thus are suitable for unifying the PHC literature. Recent findings are reviewed that provide support for the contextual associations account of PHC function. In addition to reconciling a vast breadth of literature, the synthesis presented expands the implications of the proposed account and gives rise to new and general questions about context and cognition.The role of the parahippocampal cortex in cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectA variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectVariational analysis of brightness matching.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGives an overview on variational analysis.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectContext-driven judgements as an optimal balance between contrast and dispersion.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectGeneralization of the variational framework to perceptual and cognitive phenomena.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectPossibility to derive new constraints for context-driven effects.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectStarting with a computational analysis of brightness matching, we develop a novel variational framework able to model perceptual context-driven effects that may be extended to non-physical judgments as well. The most important feature of the variational framework is the description of these phenomena as a suitable balance between contrast and dispersion. The optimal balance is defined through the simultaneous minimization of functionals characterized by two terms in opposition to each other. When the minimum is reached, the equilibrium between contrast and dispersion is attained. To show the flexibility of the proposed framework, we discuss several examples of such functionals in the field of color perception and cognition which show adherence between theoretical predictions and empirical results. With regard to social cognition theories, the simultaneous occurrence of contrast and dispersion conflicts with sequential models, thus supporting the idea of a concurrent presence of both effects in each judgment. The variational framework can serve as a view from above on perceptual and cognitive phenomena that may help in deriving new constraints for disambiguating alternative theories.A variational model for context-driven effects in perception and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creativity, primordial cognition, and personality - ScienceDirectPotential creativity measured by the Alternate Uses Test, remoteness of word associations, and rated creativity of fantasy stories was found to be related to primordial content in the fantasy stories. Psychoticism and extraversion have been found to be related to creativity. There are theoretical reasons to think that they might also be related to use of primordial cognition. Potential creativity and primordial content were correlated with both extraversion and psychoticism. Potential creativity and primordial cognition were much more strongly related to extraversion than to psychoticism. The common trait binding these traits together may be disinhibition. Relationships among creativity, primordial cognition, and extraversion are much stronger among men than among women.Creativity, primordial cognition, and personality - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The more the better?

The current research demonstrated the widely reported Mozart Effect as only partly significant. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 16 professional classical and rock musicians during a standard 2 stimulus visual oddball task, while listening to classical and rock music. During the oddball task participants were required to discriminate between an infrequent target stimulus randomly embedded in a train of repetitive background or standard stimuli. Consistent with previous research, the P3 and N2 ERPs were elicited in response to the infrequent target stimuli. Own genre preference resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the P3 for classical musicians exposed to classical music and rock musicians exposed to rock music. Notably, at the pre-attentive stage of processing (N2) beneficial effects of exposure to classical music were observed for both groups of musicians. These data are discussed in terms of short and long-term music benefits on both conscious and unconscious cognitive processes.The effects of music exposure and own genre preference on conscious and unconscious cognitive processes: A pilot ERP study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.What do monkeys' music choices mean? - ScienceDirectMcDermott and Hauser have recently shown that although monkeys show some types of preferences for sound, preferences for music are found only in humans.

We enforced active music therapy (MT) individual session to patients with Rett syndrome. The patients were 4, 5 and 6-year-old. The active music therapy and individual session of 30 min/week were performed. It was recorded in video and description, and using the original evaluation list, six items of fact. On largest problem that is hand operation with purpose in childhood of Rett syndrome, we recorded the longest duration and frequency of hand grasping time in one session. There was the improvement of 35.0% of listening music, 33.3% play music, 13.3% singing music, 11.7% minute motion, 11.7% language, and 20.0% personal relation and sociality. The longest duration of hand grasping time was improved from 2 to 12 s in case 2 and from 7 to 80 s in case 3. Grasp frequency which showed the volition rapidly increased from 3 to 41 times, though the elongation for the duration of grasping was little for case 2. Rett syndrome is the disease in which the psychomotor performance regresses with the age, but the aspect that surely developed in the session could be evaluated. Rett syndrome has the ability understanding the music, and music therapy is suitable for them.Music therapy for children with Rett syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Environmental background music and in-store selling - ScienceDirectRetailers use background music in order to enhance the atmosphere of their stores. The present study shows, as predicted by the proposed model, that the effects of music on attitudes toward the store, the salesperson, and the visit to the store are moderated by cognitive processes (number of thoughts and depth of information processing), whereas previous studies focused on emotional moderators. Soothing music (i.e., both pleasant and low arousing) is shown, as predicted, to increase cognitive activity when other cognitive stimulation is low (mainly when sales arguments are weak). However, retailers are warned that enhancing cognitive activity is no panacea since it is found here that higher cognitive activity is associated with lower attitudes. It is proposed that music fit with the store may explain such results. Music fit and cognitive processed triggered by store music are strongly suggested as avenues of store atmospherics research.Environmental background music and in-store selling - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Silent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectSilent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (149KB)Download full-size imageSilent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Silent music reading: Auditory imagery and visuotonal modality transfer in singers and non-singers - ScienceDirectAlzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Alzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectDisclosure: The author has nothing to disclose.Alzheimer's Disease: Prototype of Cognitive Deterioration, Valuable Lessons to Understand Human Cognition - ScienceDirectConflict of Interest: None.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectA framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectExternally and internally directed modes of cognition are thought to compete.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectThey only compete when both involve high levels of intentionality.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectThey can simultaneously co-occur at lower levels of intentionality.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectCompetition arises due to capacity-limited processes supported by the LPFC.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectExternally directed cognition (EDC) involves attending to stimuli in the external environment, whereas internally directed cognition (IDC) involves attending internally to thoughts, memories and mental imagery. To date, most studies have focused on the competition or trade-offs between these modes of cognition. However, both EDC and IDC include a variety of cognitive states that differ along multiple dimensions. These dimensions may influence the way in which EDC and IDC relate to each other. In this review, we present a novel framework that considers whether cognitive resources are oriented externally or internally, and also whether a given cognitive state involves intentional (i.e., voluntary) or spontaneous (i.e., involuntary) processing. Within this framework, we examine the conditions under which EDC and IDC are expected to either compete, or co-occur without interference. We argue that EDC and IDC are not inherently antagonistic, but when both involve higher levels of intentionality they are increasingly likely to compete, due to the capacity limitations of intentional processing. In contrast, if one or both involve spontaneous processing, EDC and IDC can co-occur with minimal interference given that involuntary processes are not subject to the same capacity constraints. A review of the brain regions implicated in EDC and IDC suggests that their neural substrates are partially segregated and partially convergent. Both EDC and IDC recruit the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during intentional processing, and may therefore compete over the processes and representational space it supports. However, at lower levels of intentionality, EDC and IDC rely on largely distinct neural structures, which may enable their co-occurrence without interference. The proposal that EDC and IDC can in some cases co-occur, provides a framework for understanding the complex mental states that underlie theory of mind, creativity, the influence of self-evaluative processing on cognitive control, and memory-guided attention.A framework for understanding the relationship between externally and internally directed cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Metabolic and electric brain patterns during pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by music masterpieces - ScienceDirectMetabolic and electric brain patterns during pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by music masterpieces - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Captured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectCaptured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectCaptured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectQuadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectComplex movement previously associated with improved executive function.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectParticipants undertook novel and challenging quadrupedal gait training programme.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectWCST was used to measure executive functions.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectSignificant improvements were observed in cognitive control.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectQuadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectTo determine the effects of a novel four-week quadrupedal gait training programme on markers of cognitive function and joint reposition sense in healthy adults.Quadrupedal movement training improves markers of cognition and joint repositioning - ScienceDirectTwenty-two physically active sports science students (15 male and 7 female) were divided into two groups: a training group (TG) and a control group (CG).

Visual task data were then compared with auditory task data collected previously. In contrast with the results of the auditory task, the early (N1) and late (P300) stages exhibited no differences between Guqin and piano backgrounds during the visual task. Taking our previous study and this study together, we can conclude that: although the cultural-familiar music influenced selective attention both in the early and late stages, these effects appeared only within a sensory modality (auditory) but not in cross-sensory modalities (visual). Thus, the musical cultural factor is more obvious in intramodal than in crossmodal selective attention.Crossmodal effects of Guqin and piano music on selective attention: An event-related potential study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multidimensional scaling of emotional responses to music in patients with temporal lobe resection - ScienceDirectThe present study investigated emotional responses to music by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis in patients with right or left medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions and matched normal controls (NC). Participants were required to evaluate emotional dissimilarities of nine musical excerpts that were selected to express graduated changes along the valence and arousal dimensions. For this purpose, they rated dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli on an eight-point scale and the resulting matrices were submitted to an MDS analysis. The results showed that patients did not differ from NC participants in evaluating emotional feelings induced by the musical excerpts, suggesting that all participants were able to distinguish refined emotions. We concluded that the ability to detect and use emotional valence and arousal when making dissimilarity judgments was not strongly impaired by a right or left MTL lesion. This finding has important clinical implications and is discussed in light of current neuropsychological studies on emotion. It suggests that emotional responses to music can be at least partially preserved at a non-verbal level in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage including the amygdala.Multidimensional scaling of emotional responses to music in patients with temporal lobe resection - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Purchase occasion influence on the role of music in advertising - ScienceDirectThe role of background music in audience responses to commercials (and other marketing elements) has received increasing attention in recent years. This article extends the discussion of music's influence in two ways: (1) by using music theory to analyze and investigate the effects of music's structural profiles on consumers' moods and emotions and (2) by examining the relationship between music's evoked moods that are congruent versus incongruent with the purchase occasion and the resulting effect on purchase intentions. The study reported provides empirical support for the notion that when music is used to evoke emotions congruent with the symbolic meaning of product purchase, the likelihood of purchasing is enhanced.Purchase occasion influence on the role of music in advertising - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectA music therapy case study is presented with a woman with Alzheimer's disease who participates in improvisation and song writing.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy research in dementia care is examined and links between person centred therapy and music therapy are highlighted.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing is identified as a potent therapeutic technique for working with people with dementia.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectMusic therapy afforded reminiscence, emotional self-expression and the client was able to experience herself in new ways and process what was happening in her life.Song writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectSong writing with clients who have dementia: A case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition in the Attention Economy - ScienceDirectCognition in the Attention Economy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectEffects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectEffects of music therapy on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Attitude scale development study in relation to music teaching course - ScienceDirectThe effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectObjectives.

Three studies were conducted. In Study 1 and Study 2, performed in the laboratory, participants ran at 90% of their maximal oxygen uptake on a motorized treadmill four times, once each with rock, dance, and inspirational music, and once without attending to music. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate (HR) were monitored during the run, and discomfort symptoms and music-specific questions were examined. In Study 3, performed in the field, participants ran a hilly course eight times, four under a competitive-pair condition, and four under a single-mode condition. Running time was the dependent variable.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectResults. Music failed to influence HR, RPE, and sensations of exertion in the three studies. However, about 30% of the participants indicated that the music helped them at the beginning of the run. The participants stated that music both directed their attention to the music and motivated them to continue. Despite the heavy workload reported by the runners, running with music was perceived as beneficial by many.The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations - ScienceDirectConclusions: People engaged in high intensity running may benefit from listening to music, but may not increase their ability to sustain that effort longer than they could without music.

In order to build human-level-efficient tools for data analysis, it is necessary to have a theory of how concepts are represented in the human brain. This theory should specify (a) the structure and semantics of concept representations in the human brain, and (b) types, formats and specific patterns of neuronal activity instantiating these representations. The key to a biologically-informed human brain model begins with the mapping of (a) to (b), i.e., of the emotional Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (eBICA) to informative features and characteristics of brain activity. The result is a detailed description of the information processing level of the dynamics of emotional evaluation of other agents and relationships with them in the process of joint activities, and the role of this evaluation in decision-making and generation of behavior based on the selected emotional cognitive architecture.Toward a BICA-Model-Based Study of Cognition Using Brain Imaging Techniques - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of BICA 2015.The emotional power of music: How music enhances the feeling of affective pictures - ScienceDirectThe emotional power of music: How music enhances the feeling of affective pictures - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of Need for Cognition on Internet use revisited - ScienceDirectThe effects of Need for Cognition on Internet use revisited - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectThe effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectProcessing speed and attention improved after a 3-month aerobic exercise training.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectImprovement in verbal learning occurred regardless of the type of exercise training.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectStretching exercise showed some modest improvements in cognition at follow-up.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectAerobic exercise (AE) has been shown to improve cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether these exercise-induced cognitive benefits persist beyond the training period. Accordingly, the present study sought to examine the immediate and maintenance effects of AE on a wide range of cognitive functions in 75 schizophrenia patients randomized to 12 weeks of either moderate-intensity treadmill exercise or stretching and toning exercise that served as a control. Participants completed assessments of neurocognition and cardiovascular fitness at pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. The results showed that the AE group outperformed the controls on processing speed and attention at the end of intervention. The two groups did not differ significantly in any cognitive outcome measured at follow-up; however, improvement over time was noted in certain cognitive domains in AE group. The average effect sizes at follow-up were 0.53 and 0.35 for AE and control groups, respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in aerobic fitness at posttest and follow-up, and that fitness level was not related to changes in cognitive performance. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a trend towards beneficial effects of physical activity on cognition over a short follow-up period in favor of AE.The effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in schizophrenia: A 3-month follow-up study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical emotions, cognitive science, and art of music - ScienceDirectVarious proposals and criticisms are addressed.

Music-induced movement was recorded by an optical motion-capture system, the data from which 55 postural, kinematic, and kinetic movement features were computed. These features were subsequently reduced to five principal components of movement representing Local Movement, Global Movement, Hand Flux, Head Speed, and Hand Distance. Multivariate Analyses revealed significant effects on these components of both personality and genre, as well as several interactions between the two. Each personality dimension was associated with a different pattern of movement characteristics, with Extraversion and Neuroticism eliciting the clearest relationships. Latin, Techno, and Rock music, meanwhile, most clearly elicited different movement characteristics.Effects of the Big Five and musical genre on music-induced movement - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Historical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectHistorical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Historical perspectives in music sociology - ScienceDirectTia DeNora teaches sociology at Exeter University (UK).

However, the exact source of these effects remains unclear. Given the well-known effects of sound on physiological activity, especially those of noise and of music, and on the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol in particular, we hypothesized that music may be a major source of stress during video game playing. We thus examined the effect of built-in music on cortisol secretion as a consequence of video game playing. Players were assigned quasi-randomly to either a Music or a Silence condition. Four saliva samples were taken, that is, after practice (T1), immediately after having played for 10 minutes (T2), 15 minutes after the end of the experiment (T3), and 30 minutes after the end of the experiment (T4). The results show that the Music group had significantly higher cortisol levels at T3, that is, when cortisol levels are assumed to reflect the stress induced by the game. These findings suggest for the first time that the auditory input contributes significantly to the stress response found during video game playing.Physiological stress response to video-game playing: the contribution of built-in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectReplication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectAdvanced and novice performance examined in conservatoire instrumentalists.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectA/T and SMR neurofeedback were compared with prepared and improvised pieces.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectA/T enhanced creativity/musicality, technique and communication.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectSMR improved technique and communication only in novice performance.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectNeurofeedback learning/performance outcome correlations support causation.Replication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectReplication of elite music performance enhancement following alpha/theta neurofeedback and application to novice performance and improvisation with SMR benefits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Towards a neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectMusic perception involves complex brain functions underlying acoustic analysis, auditory memory, auditory scene analysis, and processing of musical syntax and semantics. Moreover, music perception potentially affects emotion, influences the autonomic nervous system, the hormonal and immune systems, and activates (pre)motor representations. During the past few years, research activities on different aspects of music processing and their neural correlates have rapidly progressed. This article provides an overview of recent developments and a framework for the perceptual side of music processing. This framework lays out a model of the cognitive modules involved in music perception, and incorporates information about the time course of activity of some of these modules, as well as research findings about where in the brain these modules might be located.Towards a neural basis of music perception - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cues for self-recognition in point-light displays of actions performed in synchrony with music - ScienceDirectCues for self-recognition in point-light displays of actions performed in synchrony with music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectSelf-recognition by musical sounds is a fertile domain for investigating agency.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectCue integration is a key process in agency attribution in musical contexts.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectMusic research on agency has implications for theories of embodied cognition.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectImplications for research designs and applied musical practice are discussed.Know thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectKnow thy sound: Perceiving self and others in musical contexts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.From domain-generality to domain-sensitivity: 4-Month-olds learn an abstract repetition rule in music that 7-month-olds do not - ScienceDirectLearning must be constrained for it to lead to productive generalizations. Although biology is undoubtedly an important source of constraints, prior experience may be another, leading learners to represent input in ways that are more conducive to some generalizations than others, and/or to up- and down-weight features when entertaining generalizations. In two experiments, 4-month-old and 7-month-old infants were familiarized with sequences of musical chords or tones adhering either to an AAB pattern or an ABA pattern. In both cases, the 4-month-olds learned the generalization, but the 7-month-olds did not. The success of the 4-month-olds appears to contradict an account that this type of pattern learning is the provenance of a language-specific rule-learning module. It is not yet clear what drives the age-related change, but plausible candidates include differential experience with language and music, as well as interactions between general cognitive development and stimulus complexity.From domain-generality to domain-sensitivity: 4-Month-olds learn an abstract repetition rule in music that 7-month-olds do not - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The nature of music from a biological perspective - ScienceDirectMusic, as language, is a universal human trait. Throughout human history and across all cultures, people have produced and enjoyed music. Despite its ubiquity, the musical capacity is rarely studied as a biological function. Music is typically viewed as a cultural invention. In this paper, the evidence bearing on the biological perspective of the musical capacity is reviewed. Related issues, such as domain-specificity, innateness, and brain localization, are addressed in an attempt to offer a unified conceptual basis for the study of music processing. This scheme should facilitate the study of the biological foundations of music by bringing together the fields of genetics, developmental and comparative research, neurosciences, and musicology.The nature of music from a biological perspective - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectMusic listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectMusic listening and emotional well-being in adolescence: A person- and variable-oriented study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of Music Therapy on Self- and Experienced Stigma in Patients on an Acute Care Psychiatric Unit: A Randomized Three Group Effectiveness Study - ScienceDirectEffects of Music Therapy on Self- and Experienced Stigma in Patients on an Acute Care Psychiatric Unit: A Randomized Three Group Effectiveness Study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Extended cognition and the space of social interaction - ScienceDirectExtended cognition and the space of social interaction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectObjectives: To examine the effects of self-selected asynchronous (background) music on flow and netball shooting performance in three netball players. Based on the research of Karageorghis and Terry (1999) it was hypothesized that music would promote flow and would therefore have a positive impact on netball shooting performance.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectDesign: An idiographic single-subject multiple baselines across-subjects design was employed (Wollman, 1986). The rationale centred upon the work of Patrick and Hrycaiko (1998) who indicated that single-subject designs were the most appropriate methodology for applied research.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectMethods: The participants comprised three collegiate netball players who were asked to complete 11 performance trials. Each trial involved taking 12 shots from lines located at three shooting positions. After each performance trial, flow and the internal experience of each player were assessed using the Flow State Scale (Jackson & Marsh, 1996) and Practical Assessment Questionnaire. Participants received the intervention of asynchronous music with the length of pre-intervention baseline increasing for each succeeding player.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectResults: Two of the participants experienced an increase in the perception of flow while all three participants improved their netball shooting performance. In addition, participants indicated that the intervention helped them to control both the emotions and cognitions that impacted upon their performance.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectConclusions: Interventions comprising self-selected music and imagery can enhance athletic performance by triggering emotions and cognitions associated with flow.Effects of asynchronous music on flow states and shooting performance among netball players - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Tuning the brain for music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectTo study the effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture daily in a clinical setting.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectA randomized controlled trial.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAcupuncture Unit at Shenzhen Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shenzhen City of China.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectSixty children with cerebral palsy undergoing acupuncture.Effects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectEffects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectEffects of music on anxiety and pain in children with cerebral palsy receiving acupuncture: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectThis study demonstrates that listening to music while receiving acupuncture can relieve anxiety among children with cerebral palsy; however, no effect was observed in terms of pain reduction.

It relies on converging evidence from anecdotal accounts of creativity and tightly controlled laboratory studies designed to examine the processes that are assumed to operate in those anecdotes. Specific examples of creative cognition studies are described in detail with a particular focus on research concerned with accessing conceptual information at varying levels of abstraction and combining previously separate concepts. Important aspects of the design of these studies are delineated, including the main creative tasks, properties of the materials used, characteristics of responses observed, including their originality and practicality, participant and rater attributes, and the relations among these and other study aspects. Other issues addressed are generality across materials, populations, and situations, as well as causal versus correlational connections among processes, structures and creative outcomes.Creative cognition as a window on creativity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectRhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectNeural entrainment to rhythmic stimuli is largely automatic but can be modulated.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectPotential confound between rhythmic evoked responses and entrained oscillations.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectFor hierarchically structured stimuli, entrainment to a basic organizing rhythm.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectLink between temporal processing involved in speech and music perception.Rhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectRhythmic facilitation of sensory processing: A critical review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Leisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectLeisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectLeisure activities, cognition and dementia - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.It's beginning to smell (and sound) a lot like Christmas: the interactive effects of ambient scent and music in a retail setting - ScienceDirectIt's beginning to smell (and sound) a lot like Christmas: the interactive effects of ambient scent and music in a retail setting - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectIn this paper, a novel probabilistic model of harmonic progressions and a generation scheme based on such model are presented. On the basis of the large amount of publications that show the stochastic nature of the music and the possibility of modelling it by means of statistical processes, this paper shows how to create a non-homogeneous Markov chain to automatically generate harmonic progressions by building a temporal reference of the internal beat structure of music to guide the progressions. Thus, this new model develops on the classic transition matrix to include a beat-dependent / temporal layer to model the residency time.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectThe method for the automatic creation of harmonic progressions based on the model developed is presented after the model. The harmonic progressions generated by our scheme are coherent with the style of the training data employed and, thanks to the specific temporal layer designed, the musical mid-term and long-term dependencies that lead to a natural and logic cadence are taken into account. The model developed is usable for the automatic generation of harmonic patterns that can be used to enlarge the flexibility and creativity of pattern-based computational music composers.A non-homogeneous beat-based harmony Markov model - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Structure of Cognition: Attentional Episodes in Mind and Brain - ScienceDirectReactions to music, touch and object presentation in the final stage of dementia: an exploratory study - ScienceDirectTwo patients in the final stage of dementia of Alzheimer type were stimulated with music, touch and object presentation during 12 consecutive days (16 trials per patient).

The child was seen for a total of 24 sessions over a period of 9 months. The music therapy treatment involved a mixture of behavioral, improvisational, and creative approaches in what has been termed a data-based music therapy approach. A variety of musical interventions, visual, and interactive aids were used, as well as an engaging, playful dialogue between child and the clinician. The child's communicative methods at the beginning of her treatment process were almost exclusively non-verbal. By the final session, she was pronouncing a number of syllables, combination sounds, and words. The treatment program is described as it unfolded in three phases, and significant events from each individual session are described in detail.A music therapy clinical case study of a girl with childhood apraxia of speech: Finding Lily's voice - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.FOXP2 and Human Cognition - ScienceDirectUsing a mouse model, Enard et al.

However, the physiological and molecular mechanism of this effect remains unclear. We examined the effect of music exposure during the perinatal period on learning behavior in adult mice, and measured the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), which play critical roles in synaptic plasticity. In addition, we measured the levels of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), downstream targets of two main pathways in BDNF/TrkB signaling. Music-exposed mice completed a maze learning task with fewer errors than the white noise-exposed mice and had lower levels of BDNF and higher levels of TrkB and PDK1 in the cortex. MAPK levels were unchanged. Furthermore, TrkB and PDK1 protein levels in the cortex showed a significant negative correlation with the number of errors on the maze. These results suggest that perinatal exposure of mice to music has an influence on BDNF/TrkB signaling and its intracellular signaling pathway targets, including PDK1, and thus may induce improved learning and memory functions.Exposure to music in the perinatal period enhances learning performance and alters BDNF/TrkB signaling in mice as adults - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neural substrates of processing syntax and semantics in music - ScienceDirectNeural substrates of processing syntax and semantics in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectPupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectPupillary responses reflect hierarchical meter even while participants are engaged in another task.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectHierarchical beat perception thus requires no or only minimal attention.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectBeat perception was not modulated by musical expertise.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectPupil dilation indexes the violation of expectancy in the absence of attention.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectThe perception of music is a complex interaction between what we hear and our interpretation. This is reflected in beat perception, in which a listener infers a regular pulse from a musical rhythm. Although beat perception is a fundamental human ability, it is still unknown whether attention to the music is necessary to establish the perception of stronger and weaker beats, or meter. In addition, to what extent beat perception is dependent on musical expertise is still a matter of debate. Here, we address these questions by measuring the pupillary response to omissions at different metrical positions in drum rhythms, while participants attended to another task. We found that the omission of the salient first beat elicited a larger pupil dilation than the omission of the less-salient second beat. This result shows that participants not only detected the beat without explicit attention to the music, but also perceived a metrical hierarchy of stronger and weaker beats. This suggests that hierarchical beat perception is an automatic process that requires no or minimal attentional resources. In addition, we found no evidence for the hypothesis that hierarchical beat perception is affected by musical expertise, suggesting that elementary beat perception might be independent from musical expertise. Finally, our results show that pupil dilation reflects surprise without explicit attention, demonstrating that the pupil is an accessible index to signatures of unattentive processing.Pupillary response indexes the metrical hierarchy of unattended rhythmic violations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Using music to communicate computing information - ScienceDirectUsing music to communicate computing information - ScienceDirectIn this paper we explore how sound, specifically musical sound, can be used to communicate computing information.

The second study aimed to demonstrate that musical structures could communicate information about high-level programming language structures and program run-time behaviour. Both studies showed that music could successfully be used as a communication medium and that listeners did not need to be musically trained to benefit from the audio signals.

The fractal dimension of a great number of different musics (180 scores) is calculated by the Variation method. By using an analysis of variance, it is shown that fractal dimension helps discriminate different categories of music. Then, we used an original statistical technique based on the Bootstrap assumption to find a time window in which fractal dimension reaches a high power of music discrimination. The best discrimination is obtained between 1/44100 and 16/44100 Hertz. We admit that to distinguish some different aspects of music well, the high information quantity is obtained in the high frequency domain. By calculating fractal dimension with the ANAM method, it was statistically proven that fractal dimension could distinguish different kinds of music very well: musics could be classified by their fractal dimensions.Fractal dimension and classification of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neurocognitive impairment is associated with corpus callosum atrophy in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectNeurocognitive impairment is associated with corpus callosum atrophy in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Infant music perception: Domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms? - ScienceDirectInfant music perception: Domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evaluating a servicescape: the effect of cognition and emotion - ScienceDirectEvaluating a servicescape: the effect of cognition and emotion - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Using Orff-based techniques in children's bereavement groups: A cognitive-behavioral music therapy approach - ScienceDirectChildren affected by the death of a loved one can face multiple challenges including difficulties identifying and dealing with emotions, impaired social interactions, distorted thoughts, and behavioral problems.

However, this elite perspective underestimates the abilities of non-musicians. We report that Western musicians and non-musicians, and non-Westerners (i.e. Chinese participants) rated pairs of excerpts presented auditorily as more similar as their compositional styles were closer in history. Moreover, the styles were considered by all participants as more different when presented in historical order, the older style preceding the more recent style (e.g. Baroque followed by Romantic), than the reverse (e.g. Romantic followed by Baroque). This historical distance effect appears related to rhythm (or temporal variability).Differentiation of classical music requires little learning but rhythm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Infants' perception of consonance and dissonance in music - ScienceDirectThe origins of the perception of consonance and dissonance in music are a matter of debate. The present study examined the hypothesis of an innate preferential bias favoring consonance over dissonance by exposing 4 month old infants to consonant and dissonant versions of two melodies. Infants looked significantly longer at the source of sound and were less motorically active to consonant compared with dissonant versions of each melody. Further, fretting and turning away from the music source occurred more frequently during the dissonant than the consonant versions. The results suggest that infants are biologically prepared to treat consonance as perceptually more pleasing than dissonance.Infants' perception of consonance and dissonance in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Infants' perception of consonance and dissonance in music - ScienceDirectMarcel R.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that quality of life of Alzheimer's patients is significantly improved with music therapy, accompanied by the overall social benefits of acceptance and sense of belonging gained by communicating with others. Music therapy, when based on clear treatment objectives can reduce the individual prescription of tranquillising medication, reduce the use of hypnotics and help overall goals of rehabilitation. Mood improvement and self-expression, the stimulation of speech and organisation of mental processes; and sensory stimulation and motor integration are promoted. Given that the rate of deterioration in Alzheimer's disease is not predictable, a series of single case experimental designs would generate valuable empirical data concerning treatment outcome and promote basic research into the timing functions required for the co-ordination of cognition, physiology, motor ability and the integrity of behaviour.Alzheimer's Disease: rhythm, timing and music as therapy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complementary aspects of emotions and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Complementary aspects of emotions and music - ScienceDirectGait in ageing and associated dementias; its relationship with cognition - ScienceDirectThe focus of this review is on the close relationship between gait and cognition in ageing and associated dementias. This close relationship is supported by epidemiological studies, clinical studies of older people with and without dementia that focused on the intensity of the physical activity, clinical studies with older persons without dementia examining a relationship between gait and specific cognitive processes, and human and animal experimental studies examining a neural basis for such a relationship.Gait in ageing and associated dementias; its relationship with cognition - ScienceDirectDespite these findings, most studies with patients with dementia focus exclusively on the relationship between cognition and dementia, with relatively few addressing the relationship between gait and dementia.

Those with seizures include Lord George Byron in the setting of terminal illness, Algernon Swinburne who had alcohol-related seizures, Charles Lloyd who had seizures and psychosis, Edward Lear who had childhood onset seizures, and Vachel Lindsay. The possibility that Emily Dickinson had epilepsy is also discussed.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectIt has not been possible to identify great talents with epilepsy who excel in poetic or musical composition. There are few published poets with epilepsy and no great composers. Why is this? Similarities between music and poetry include meter, tone, stress, rhythm, and form, and much poetry is sung with music. It is likely that great musical and poetic compositions demand a greater degree of concentration and memory than is possible in epilepsy, resulting in problems retaining a musical and mathematical structure over time. The lack of association between recognizable neuropsychiatric disorders and these skills is a gateway to understanding facets of the relationship between the brain and creativity.Musical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectMusical and poetic creativity and epilepsy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music-induced mood modulates the strength of emotional negativity bias: An ERP study - ScienceDirectMusic-induced mood modulates the strength of emotional negativity bias: An ERP study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Congenital amusias - ScienceDirectCongenital amusias - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.What child is this? What interval was that? Familiar tunes and music perception in novice listeners - ScienceDirectIn the laboratory, musical novices often seem insensitive even to basic structural elements of music (octaves, intervals, etc.), undermining long-held theories of music perception, and threatening to leave current theories applicable only to experts. Consequently it is important to demonstrate novices' basic listening competence where possible. Two experiments examined the perception of musical intervals (minor thirds, major thirds and perfect fourths) by musical novices. Subjects received either standard instructions or familiar folk-tune labels to aid performance. The folk-tune labels greatly improved identification performance, producing expert-caliber performance by some musically inexperienced subjects. The effectiveness of the folk-tune manipulation was much more limited in a difficult discrimination task. The results suggest that novices do have some basic competence when assayed appropriately, and that familiar musical tokens may be a critical element in such assays. Larger implications of the role of familiarity in novices' competence are discussed, including those that relate to music cognition and aesthetics.What child is this? What interval was that?

In the present social and occupational environment exposure to chronic loud sound in the form of occupational or recreational noise, is becoming inevitable. This could especially disrupt the functional auditory cortex development leading to altered processing of complex sound and hearing impairment. Here we report the effects of prenatal chronic loud sound (110-dB sound pressure level (SPL)) exposure (rhythmic [music] and arrhythmic [noise] forms) on the molecular components involved in regulation of the E/I balance in the developing auditory cortex analog/Field L (AuL) in domestic chicks. Noise exposure at 110-dB SPL significantly enhanced the E/I ratio (increased expression of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit and glutamate with decreased expression of GABA(A) receptor gamma 2 subunit and GABA), whereas loud music exposure maintained the E/I ratio. Expressions of markers of synaptogenesis, synaptic stability and plasticity i.e., synaptophysin, PSD-95 and gephyrin were reduced with noise but increased with music exposure. Thus our results showed differential effects of prenatal chronic loud noise and music exposures on the E/I balance and synaptic function and stability in the developing auditory cortex. Loud music exposure showed an overall enrichment effect whereas loud noise-induced significant alterations in E/I balance could later impact the auditory function and associated cognitive behavior.Differential effects of prenatal chronic high-decibel noise and music exposure on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components of the auditory cortex analog in developing chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectFractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectIn this study we investigated the neural processing of fractals.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectVisual hierarchies are efficiently represented using self-embedding rules.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectRule-based hierarchical processing recruits the visual dorsal stream.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectSelf-embedding rules additionally activate the parieto-medial temporal pathway.Fractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectFractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectFractal image perception provides novel insights into hierarchical cognition - ScienceDirectBrain activation was compared across three different tasks: a similarity task, and two hierarchical tasks in which subjects were asked to recognize the repetition of a rule operating transformations either within an existing hierarchical level, or generating new hierarchical levels.

In addition, the level-generating task specifically activated circuits related to the integration of spatial and categorical information, and with the integration of items in contexts (posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and medial, ventral and anterior regions of temporal cortex).

Music is particularly well suited for studying neuronal plasticity in the human brain because musical training is more complex and multimodal than most other daily life activities, and because prospective and professional musicians usually pursue the training with high and long-lasting commitment. Therefore, music has increasingly been used as a tool for the investigation of human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Music relates to many brain functions like perception, action, cognition, emotion, learning and memory and therefore music is an ideal tool to investigate how the human brain is working and how different brain functions interact. Novel findings have been obtained in the field of induced cortical plasticity by musical training. The positive effects, which music in its various forms has in the healthy human brain are not only important in the framework of basic neuroscience, but they also will strongly affect the practices in neuro-rehabilitation.Plasticity of the human auditory cortex related to musical training - ScienceDirectPlasticity of the human auditory cortex related to musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectPeople with mental disorders use music for the reduction of negative emotions.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe preference of reflexive and complex music (classical music/jazz) is mostly preferred by people with personality disorders.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe preference of reflexive and complex music (classical music/jazz) is used less for fun stimulation than in healthy individuals.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectMusical preferences are linked to specific patterns of emotion modulation in mental disorders.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe knowledge of the role of music preferences has a special impact on music therapy and psychotherapy.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe objective of this study was to explore the relationship between the use of music in everyday life for the modulation of emotions and musical preferences, focussing on people with mental disorders. Musical preferences were assessed in the population of a psychiatric hospital according to different musical preference categories. The IAAM (inventory for the assessment of activation and arousal modulation through music) measured the situation-dependent use of music in everyday life. Data were compared to a healthy control population.The role musical preferences play in the modulation of emotions for people with mental disorders - ScienceDirectThe results indicated that people with mental disorders used music for the reduction of emotions with negative valence. This was especially true for those individuals who preferred reflective and complex music (such as classical music). These participants primarily had diagnoses of personality disorders, and they used music less for fun than healthy comparators. Connections between musical preferences and emotional modulation patterns in the use of music in everyday life were much more differentiated in the general population than in the psychiatric cohort.

We also address cognitive aging and attempt to specify which altered cognitive functions negatively impact balance and walking. The role of cognition in postural control is tested with dual-task experiments. This situation results in deleterious effects due to an attentional overload. Given the human cognitive system has limited capacities, we propose that simultaneously performing two tasks depends on the capacity of each individual to perform these tasks on a continuum between automatic execution to highly controlled performance. A level of maximum control exceeds the subject's attentional capacity, which makes it impossible to perform both tasks simultaneously. The subject therefore prioritizes one of the tasks. We use representative dual-task studies from the literature to illustrate the relationship between the different cognitive components and their impact on the control of posture and gait in elderly subjects with altered cognitive capacities and with elderly subjects who are fallers or who have altered sensory-motor capacities. Recently this postural-cognitive relationship was addressed with a new approach. We report how cognitive training can improve dual-task management and we attempt to define the cognitive mechanisms that may be responsible for better postural balance.Posture and cognition in the elderly: Interaction and contribution to the rehabilitation strategies - ScienceDirectPosture and cognition in the elderly: Interaction and contribution to the rehabilitation strategies - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Techniques and devices to restore cognition - ScienceDirectTechniques and devices to restore cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cortical Systems Associated with Covert Music Rehearsal - ScienceDirectMusicalrepresentation and overt music production are necessarily complex cognitive phenomena. While overt musical performance may be observed and studied, the act of performance itself necessarily skews results toward the importance of primary sensorimotor and auditory cortices. However, imagined musical performance (IMP) represents a complex behavioral task involving components suited to exploring the physiological underpinnings of musical cognition in music performance without the sensorimotor and auditory confounds of overt performance. We mapped the blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI activation response associated with IMP in experienced musicians independent of the piece imagined. IMP consistently activated supplementary motor and premotor areas, right superior parietal lobule, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral mid-frontal gyri, and bilateral lateral cerebellum in contrast with rest, in a manner distinct from fingertapping versus rest and passive listening to the same piece versus rest. These data implicate an associative network independent of primary sensorimotor and auditory activity, likely representing the cortical elements most intimately linked to music production.Cortical Systems Associated with Covert Music Rehearsal - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cortical Systems Associated with Covert Music Rehearsal - ScienceDirectTo whom correspondence should be addressed.

Agitation results when this stress threshold is exceeded. A proposed mid-range theory incorporates these elements to discuss the use of individualized music to alleviate agitation. Music may provide a method of communicating with this population even in advanced stages when the person is unable to understand verbal language and has decreased ability to interpret environmental stimuli. It is predicted that the presentation of music carefully selected for meaningfulness to the person during his or her younger years will stimulate memory for remote events, and elicitation of memories associated with positive feelings will have a soothing effect and will alleviate or decrease agitated behaviors. Results from a pilot study and preliminary findings from a study currently underway are provided as beginning efforts to support this mid-range theory.

First, five acoustic characteristics (i.e., intensity, pitch, timbre, tonality, and rhythm) are extracted to generate an original feature set. A feature-selection model using the SAHS algorithm is then employed for each pair of genres, thereby deriving the corresponding local feature set. Finally, each one-against-one support vector machine (SVM) classifier is fed with the corresponding local feature set, and the majority voting method is used to classify each musical recording. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset were conducted, demonstrating that our method is effective. The results show that the local-selection strategies using wrapper and filter approaches ranked first and third in performance among all relevant methods.Music genre classification based on local feature selection using a self-adaptive harmony search algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music genre classification based on local feature selection using a self-adaptive harmony search algorithm - ScienceDirectYin-Fu Huang received the B.S. degree in computer science from National Chiao-Tung University in 1979, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from National Tsing-Hua University in 1984 and 1988, respectively.

Study 1 used retrospective reports of musical imagery to assess the contribution of individual differences to imagery characteristics. Study 2 used an experience sampling design to assess the phenomenology of musical imagery over the course of one week in a sample of musicians and non-musicians. Both studies found episodes of musical imagery to be common and positive: people rarely wanted such experiences to end and often heard music that was personally meaningful. Several variables predicted musical imagery, including personality, musical preferences, and positive mood. Musicians tended to hear musical imagery more often, but they reported less frequent episodes of deliberately-generated imagery. Taken together, the present research provides new insights into individual differences in musical imagery, and it supports the emerging view that such experiences are common, positive, and more voluntary than previously recognized.Music to the inner ears: Exploring individual differences in musical imagery - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectMaking the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectSports relevant frequency and time-domain EEG studies are reviewed.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectEfficacy of neurofeedback for performance enhancement is assessed.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectKey findings are outlined; limitations are identified and discussed.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectImportance of mobile EEG for future research in sport is highlighted.Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance - ScienceDirectIn the high stakes world of International sport even the smallest change in performance can make the difference between success and failure, leading sports professionals to become increasingly interested in the potential benefits of neuroimaging. Here we describe evidence from EEG studies that either identify neural signals associated with expertise in sport, or employ neurofeedback to improve performance. Evidence for the validity of neurofeedback as a technique for enhancing sports performance remains limited. By contrast, progress in characterizing the neural correlates of sporting behavior is clear: frequency domain studies link expert performance to changes in alpha rhythms, whilst time-domain studies link expertise in response evaluation and motor output with modulations of P300 effects and readiness potentials. Despite early promise, however, findings have had relatively little impact for sports professionals, at least in part because there has been a mismatch between lab tasks and real sporting activity. After selectively reviewing existing findings and outlining limitations, we highlight developments in mobile EEG technology that offer new opportunities for sports neuroscience.What is specific to music processing?

Recent findings also suggest that the brain is equipped with music-specific neural networks and that these can be selectively compromised by a congenital anomaly. This results in a disorder, congenital amusia, that appears to be limited to the processing of music. Recent evidence points to fine-grained perception of pitch as the root of musical handicap. Hence, musical abilities appear to depend crucially on the fine-tuning of pitch, in much the same way that language abilities rely on fine time resolution.What is specific to music processing?

However, empirical data supporting this idea have been lacking. This has been partly due to the difficulty of developing and applying comparable quantitative measures to melody and rhythm in speech and music. This study uses a recently-developed measure for the study of speech rhythm to compare rhythmic patterns in English and French language and classical music. We find that English and French musical themes are significantly different in this measure of rhythm, which also differentiates the rhythm of spoken English and French. Thus, there is an empirical basis for the claim that spoken prosody leaves an imprint on the music of a culture.An empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The intrinsic link between motor behavior and temporal cognition - ScienceDirectThe debate about the cognitive mechanisms behind human temporal processing has raged for decades without a clear resolution. The theory presented here describes a different perspective to the traditional accounts on the issue, namely, that motor behaviors or sequences of motor behaviors provide a means of reproducing time intervals. Evidence behind this perspective includes tapping strategies (exemplified by musicians), counting strategies, and neuropsychological results showing activation of motor areas during temporal cognitive tasks. I propose that motor behaviors aid human timing by offering a set of processes that consistently take a set amount of time to accomplish. Motor behaviors also allow segmentation of larger intervals into smaller intervals that are easier to estimate. I conclude with a discussion of implications of this perspective on temporal cognition.The intrinsic link between motor behavior and temporal cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.State of the art on targeted memory reactivation: Sleep your way to enhanced cognition - ScienceDirectTargeted memory reactivation is a fairly simple technique that has the potential to influence the course of memory formation through application of cues during sleep. Studies have shown that cueing memory during sleep can lead to either an enhanced or decreased representation of the information encoded in the targeted networks, depending on experimental variations. The effects have been associated with sleep parameters and accompanied by activation of memory related brain areas. The findings suggest a causal role of neuronal replay in memory consolidation and provide evidence for the active system consolidation hypothesis. However, the observed inconsistencies across studies suggest that further research is warranted regarding the underlying neural mechanisms and optimal conditions for the application of targeted memory reactivation. The goal of the present review is to integrate the currently available experimental data and to provide an overview of this technique's limitations and pitfalls, as well as its potential applications in everyday use and clinical treatment. Exploring the open questions herein identified should lead to insight into safer and more effective ways of adjusting memory representations to better suit individual needs.State of the art on targeted memory reactivation: Sleep your way to enhanced cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.State of the art on targeted memory reactivation: Sleep your way to enhanced cognition - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this paper.Social Cognition and the Evolution of Language: Constructing Cognitive Phylogenies - ScienceDirectPopular music, identity, and sexualization: A latent class analysis of artist types - ScienceDirectA key ingredient of the production of popular music involves making decisions about the distinct character type of a particular artist. But there is a dearth of scientific studies that empirically examine artist images in a macro context, thus the range of gendered and sexualized artist types available in the marketplace is only known through interpretive studies contextually confined in scope. After collecting descriptive information on a sample of highly promoted artists played at least one time on monitored radio stations in an 18-month period (417 female and 1943 male popular music artists), I offer an empirical description of gendered, raced and sexualized artist types using Latent Class Analysis. I find 10 male types (Soul Singer, Leader, Romantic Singer-Songwriters, Thugs, Anti-Heroes, Absurd Extremists, Sophisticated Singer-Songwriters, Emotypes, Summer Party Jammers, and Others) and 6 female types (Femme Fatales, Models of Femininity, Pop Princesses, Chanteuse Singer-Songwriters, Underground Feminists, and Others).

However, the mechanisms by which music modulates the neural activity associated with learning and memory remain largely unexplored. We evaluated coherent frontal oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while subjects were engaged in a modified version of Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Subjects heard either a spoken version of the AVLT or the conventional AVLT word list sung. Learning-related changes in coherence (LRCC) were measured by comparing the EEG during word encoding on correctly recalled trials to the immediately preceding trial on which the same word was not recalled. There were no significant changes in coherence associated with conventional verbal learning. However, musical verbal learning was associated with increased coherence within and between left and right frontal areas in theta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands. It is unlikely that the different patterns of LRCC reflect general performance differences; the groups exhibited similar learning performance. The results suggest that verbal learning with a musical template strengthens coherent oscillations in frontal cortical networks involved in verbal encoding.Music increases frontal EEG coherence during verbal learning - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of group-singing on older adult health in senior living communities: A pilot study - ScienceDirectParticipating in a group-singing program may be beneficial to healthy aging through engaging in active music-making activities and breathing exercises.

Popular songs in the verse-chorus form provide a useful model for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of artificial rewards, because the chorus is usually the most rewarding element of a song. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, the stimuli were excerpts of 10 popular songs with a tensioned verse-to-chorus transition. We examined the neural correlates of three phases of reward processing: (1) reward-anticipation during the verse-to-chorus transition, (2) reward-gain during the first phrase of the chorus, and (3) reward-loss during the unexpected noise followed by the verse-to-chorus transition. Participants listened to these excerpts in a risk-reward context because the verse was followed by either the chorus or noise with equal probability. The results showed that reward-gain and reward-loss were associated with left- and right-biased temporoparietal junction activation, respectively. The bilateral temporoparietal junctions were active during reward-anticipation. Moreover, we observed left-biased lateral orbitofrontal activation during reward-anticipation, whereas the medial orbitofrontal cortex was activated during reward-gain. The findings are discussed in relation to the cognitive and emotional aspects of reward processing.Listening to music in a risk-reward context: The roles of the temporoparietal junction and the orbitofrontal/insular cortices in reward-anticipation, reward-gain, and reward-loss - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Do dopaminergic gene polymorphisms affect mesolimbic reward activation of music listening response?

In our present study, we investigated the effects of early auditory enrichment with music on rat auditory discrimination learning. We found that early auditory enrichment with music from postnatal day (PND) 14 enhanced learning ability in auditory signal-detection task and in sound duration-discrimination task. In parallel, a significant increase was noted in NMDA receptor subunit NR2B protein expression in the auditory cortex. Furthermore, we found that auditory enrichment with music starting from PND 28 or 56 did not influence NR2B expression in the auditory cortex. No difference was found in the NR2B expression in the inferior colliculus (IC) between music-exposed and normal rats, regardless of when the auditory enrichment with music was initiated. Our findings suggest that early auditory enrichment with music influences NMDA-mediated neural plasticity, which results in enhanced auditory discrimination learning.Early auditory enrichment with music enhances auditory discrimination learning and alters NR2B protein expression in rat auditory cortex - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Early auditory enrichment with music enhances auditory discrimination learning and alters NR2B protein expression in rat auditory cortex - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Circadian rhythms and cognition - ScienceDirectLike all circadian (near-24-h) rhythms, those of cognition have endogenous and exogenous components. The origins of these components, together with effects of time awake upon cognitive performance, are described in subjects living conventionally (sleeping at night and active during the daytime). Based on these considerations, predictions can be made about changes that might be expected in the days after a time-zone transition and during night work. The relevant literature on these circumstances is then reviewed.

Previous work has demonstrated marked interindividual variability in onset and rate of decline. Such variability has been linked to factors such as maintenance of functional and structural brain integrity, genetics, and lifestyle. Still, few, if any, studies have combined a longitudinal design with repeated multimodal imaging and a comprehensive assessment of cognition as well as genetic and lifestyle factors. The present paper introduces the Cognition, Brain, and Aging (COBRA) study, in which cognitive performance and brain structure and function are measured in a cohort of 181 older adults aged 64 to 68 years at baseline. Participants will be followed longitudinally over a 10-year period, resulting in a total of three equally spaced measurement occasions. The measurement protocol at each occasion comprises a comprehensive set of behavioral and imaging measures. Cognitive performance is evaluated via computerized testing of working memory, episodic memory, perceptual speed, motor speed, implicit sequence learning, and vocabulary. Brain imaging is performed using positron emission tomography with [11C]-raclopride to assess dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for assessment of white and gray-matter integrity and cerebrovascular perfusion, and functional MRI maps brain activation during rest and active task conditions. Lifestyle descriptives are collected, and blood samples are obtained and stored for future evaluation. Here, we present selected results from the baseline assessment along with a discussion of sample characteristics and methodological considerations that determined the design of the study.COBRA: A prospective multimodal imaging study of dopamine, brain structure and function, and cognition - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Memory & Aging.Central processing of music and its disturbances - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are consonant intervals music to their ears? Spontaneous acoustic preferences in a nonhuman primate - ScienceDirectHumans find some sounds more pleasing than others; such preferences may underlie our enjoyment of music. To gain insight into the evolutionary origins of these preferences, we explored whether they are present in other animals. We designed a novel method to measure the spontaneous sound preferences of cotton-top tamarins, a species that has been extensively tested for other perceptual abilities. Animals were placed in a V-shaped maze, and their position within the maze controlled their auditory environment. One sound was played when they were in one branch of the maze, and a different sound for the opposite branch; no food was delivered during testing. We used the proportion of time spent in each branch as a measure of preference. The first two experiments were designed as tests of our method. In Experiment 1, we used loud and soft white noise as stimuli; all animals spent most of their time on the side with soft noise. In Experiment 2, tamarins spent more time on the side playing species-specific feeding chirps than on the side playing species-specific distress calls. Together, these two experiments suggest that the method is effective, providing a spontaneous measure of preference. In Experiment 3, however, subjects showed no preference for consonant over dissonant intervals. Finally, tamarins showed no preference in Experiment 4 for a screeching sound (comparable to fingernails on a blackboard) over amplitude-matched white noise. In contrast, humans showed clear preferences for the consonant intervals of Experiment 3 and the white noise of Experiment 4 using the same stimuli and a similar method. We conclude that tamarins' preferences differ qualitatively from those of humans. The preferences that support our capacity for music may, therefore, be unique among the primates, and could be music-specific adaptations.Are consonant intervals music to their ears?

Cerebral perfusion and hence cognition can be enhanced by exercise. The present review describes first how the effects of exercise on cerebral perfusion in AD are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and tissue-type plasminogen activator, the release of which is regulated by NO. A conclusion of clinical relevance is that exercise may not be beneficial for the cognitive functioning of all people with dementia if cardiovascular risk factors are present.Exercise, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: More is not necessarily better - ScienceDirectThe extent to which cardiovascular risk factors play a role in the selection of older people with dementia in clinical studies will be addressed in the second part of the review in which the effects of exercise on cognition are presented. Only eight relevant studies were found in the literature, emphasizing the paucity of studies in this field. Positive effects of exercise on cognition were reported in seven studies, including two that excluded and two that included patients with cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that cardiovascular risk factors do not necessarily undo the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition in cognitively impaired people. Further research is called for, in view of the limitations of the clinical studies reviewed here.Exercise, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: More is not necessarily better - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.How can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectMusic performance is examined using an analysis-by-synthesis method. As a result a note-to-tone conversion program emerged containing a generative rule system for musical performance. Some of these performance rules are presented and discussed. In particular, the purpose of the rules in music communication is analyzed. Three main purposes are identified: (1) differentiation of pitch and duration categories, (2) marking of boundaries between tone groups, and (3) timing and tuning agreement in ensembles. The possible origin of the performance rules is also discussed. Many striking similarities with speech and other types of human communication suggest that expressive details in music performance are not specific to music. On the contrary, they appear to allude to and thus become meaningful because of the listener's extramusical experiences.How can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectHow can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectHow can music be expressive? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neural bases of eye and gaze processing: The core of social cognition - ScienceDirectEyes and gaze are very important stimuli for human social interactions. Recent studies suggest that impairments in recognizing face identity, facial emotions or in inferring attention and intentions of others could be linked to difficulties in extracting the relevant information from the eye region including gaze direction. In this review, we address the central role of eyes and gaze in social cognition. We start with behavioral data demonstrating the importance of the eye region and the impact of gaze on the most significant aspects of face processing. We review neuropsychological cases and data from various imaging techniques such as fMRI/PET and ERP/MEG, in an attempt to best describe the spatio-temporal networks underlying these processes. The existence of a neuronal eye detector mechanism is discussed as well as the links between eye gaze and social cognition impairments in autism. We suggest impairments in processing eyes and gaze may represent a core deficiency in several other brain pathologies and may be central to abnormal social cognition.Neural bases of eye and gaze processing: The core of social cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neural bases of eye and gaze processing: The core of social cognition - ScienceDirectVerbal and music dichotic listening tasks reveal variations in functional cerebral asymmetry across the menstrual cycle that are phase and task dependent - ScienceDirectTwo dichotic listening tests, one a verbal consonant-vowel identification task, the other a musical chord recognition task, were administered to 32 women at two points during the menstrual cycle, menses (when oestrogen is low) and the midluteal phase (when oestrogen is high), in a counterbalanced repeated measures design. The degree of asymmetry changed across the cycle for both syllables and music. The right ear advantage recorded for the verbal task was greater during the midluteal phase than during menses. The left ear advantage recorded for the music task was greater during menses than during the midluteal phase. These reciprocal changes in asymmetry were the result of consistent changes in ear performance. From menses to the midluteal phase, left ear (right hemisphere) performance fell significantly for both tasks whereas right ear (left hemisphere) performance showed a small, but non-significant, increase. The findings are discussed in the light of evidence for phasic activational effects of gonadal steroids on both asymmetry and cognition which provide an explanation for the sometimes elusive nature and small effect size of sex differences in these characteristics. The relationships between sex differences in asymmetry and cognition are re-examined.Verbal and music dichotic listening tasks reveal variations in functional cerebral asymmetry across the menstrual cycle that are phase and task dependent - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multimodal cortical plasticity and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Classifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirectHow do experts assess the quality of fine art museums? While there is a well-developed body of sociological knowledge on evaluation and classification processes, there has been little work to treat museums as an object of inquiry. Yet guidance from the multidisciplinary museum literature only offers an undersocialized view of these organizations. I argue that museums offer a rich opportunity to study how classification, cognition, and interaction unfold in a developed field, because valuation processes are related to aesthetics in a particularly rich way. A diverse group of museum professionals offer their perspectives on organizational quality. The study finds that art professionals make an extensive range of symbolic distinctions in their understanding of quality, some of which are shared. How individuals compare museums to one another illuminates implicit status hierarchies and classification biases in cognition. A unique contribution of this study lies in the explication of different kinds of interactions between museums. In doing so, this study adds depth to prior work on evaluation, and breadth to research on inter-organization relationships.Classifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirectClassifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Classifying quality: Cognition, interaction, and status appraisal of art museums - ScienceDirectMark C.

According to reductionist theories, listeners judge the structural importance of musical events while forming mental representations. These judgments may result from the production of reduced memory representations that retain only the musical gist. In a study of improvised music performance, pianists produced variations on melodies. Analyses of the musical events retained across variations provided support for the reductionist account of structural importance. A neural network trained to produce reduced memory representations for the same melodies represented structurally important events more efficiently than others. Agreement among the musicians' improvisations, the network model, and music-theoretic predictions suggest that perceived constancy across musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist mechanism for producing memory representations.Reduced memory representations for music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reduced memory representations for music - ScienceDirectThis research was partially supported by NIMH Grant l R29-MH45764 to Caroline Palmer, and by ONR Grant N00014-92-J115 to Jordan B.

The variety of domains that are encompassed by music is so diverse that it is unclear whether a single domain of structure or experience is defining. Music is best understood as a form of communication in which formal codes (acoustic patterns and their auditory representations) are employed to elicit a variety of conscious experiences. After proposing our theoretical perspective we offer three prominent examples of conscious experiences elicited by the code of music: the recognition of structure itself, affect, and the experience of motion.Varieties of musical experience - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music and Language in Degenerative Disease of the Brain - ScienceDirectMusic and language functions were studied in two musicians with degenerative disease. Both patients were tested on a standardized language battery and a series of music tasks. In the first case with left cortical atrophy and primary progressive aphasia, expressive music functions were spared with impaired reception of rhythm. The second case with posterior cortical atrophy, greater on the right, was nonaphasic, had spatial agraphia, a visuopractic deficit, and severe expressive music deficits, but intact rhythm repetition. The aphasic patient showed dissociations between music and language in fluency and content; continuous, organized, although reiterative music production was contrasted with nonfluent language. The nonaphasic patient showed the opposite pattern of deficits; unmusical production with impaired melody and rhythm organization that was contrasted with fluent, intelligible language. The double dissociation between language and music functions supports the existence of independent cognitive systems, one consistent with conventional left lateralization models of language, temporal sequence, and analytic music processing and another with a right lateralization model of implicit music cognition.Music and Language in Degenerative Disease of the Brain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services - ScienceDirectThe impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of musical training on music processing: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans - ScienceDirectPrevious studies have demonstrated changes in neuronal activity in trained musicians relative to controls while performing various music processing tasks. In this study the neural correlates of the effect of music training on two aspects of music processing, melody and harmony, are investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen subjects, seven with continuous musical training from early childhood to adulthood and eight without, underwent a passive fMRI listening paradigm designed to test the effects of melodic and harmonic processing. Melodic processing activated the most anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus for both musicians and non-musicians, while harmonic processing activated different visual association areas for musicians relative to non-musicians. The inferior parietal lobules were recruited only by musicians for both tasks. We conclude that musical training results in the recruitment of different neural networks for these aspects of music processing.The effect of musical training on music processing: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Acquired amusia - ScienceDirectRecent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of music suggest that a further review of the topic of amusia is timely. In this chapter, we first consider previous taxonomies of amusia and propose a fresh framework for understanding the amusias, essentially as disorders of cognitive information processing. We critically review current cognitive and neuroanatomic findings in the published literature on amusia. We assess the extent to which the clinical and neuropsychologic evidence in amusia can be reconciled; both with the information-processing framework we propose, and with the picture of the brain organization of music and language processing emerging from cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroimaging studies. The balance of evidence suggests that the amusias can be understood as disorders of musical object cognition targeting separable levels of an information-processing hierarchy and underpinned by specific brain network dysfunction. The neuroanatomic associations of the amusias show substantial overlap with brain networks that process speech; however, this convergence leaves scope for separable brain mechanisms based on altered connectivity and dynamics across culprit networks. The study of the amusias contributes to an increasingly complex picture of the musical brain that transcends any simple dichotomy between music and speech or other complex sounds.Acquired amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The development of evaluative responses to music:: Infants prefer to listen to consonance over dissonance - ScienceDirectIn Experiment 1, 6-month-old infants looked longer in order to listen to a set of consonant intervals than to a set of dissonant intervals. In Experiment 2, infants preferred to listen to the original version of a Mozart minuet than to a version altered to contain many dissonant intervals. Thus, although infants do not yet have the musical-system-specific knowledge of scale structure that is involved in adults' emotional reactions to music, infants are similar to adults in their evaluative reactions to consonance and dissonance.The development of evaluative responses to music:: Infants prefer to listen to consonance over dissonance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The development of evaluative responses to music:: Infants prefer to listen to consonance over dissonance - ScienceDirectLaurel J.

The first experiment showed that positively or negatively evaluated music could be used to establish a conditioned response to previously neutral Greek letter stimuli. It was found that the affective responses elicited by liked or disliked music transferred onto previously neutral stimuli changing subjects' evaluation of and preference for these stimuli accordingly. The second study examined the potential of music to change existing negative affective responses to feared animals in persons with genuine animal phobias. Positively evaluated (liked) music was included in every second treatment session involving in vivo exposure to the feared animals. Overall, results show that liked music invoked a positive affective state that increased the effectiveness of in vivo exposure. In sessions with music clients' evaluations and fear decreased more than in sessions without music.

Six experiments were designed to explore the perceptual basis of emotional judgments in music. In each experiment, the same set of 32 excerpts taken from the classical repertoire and intended to convey a happy or sad tone were presented under various transformations and with different task demands. In Expts. 1 to 3, subjects were required to judge on a 10-point scale whether the excerpts were happy or sad. Altogether the results show that emotional judgments are (a) highly consistent across subjects and resistant to brain damage; (b) determined by musical structure (mode and tempo); and (c) immediate. Experiments 4 to 6 were designed to assess whether emotional and non-emotional judgments reflect the operations of a single perceptual analysis system. To this aim, we searched for evidence of dissociation in our brain-damaged patient, I.R., by using tasks that do not require emotional interpretation. These non-emotional tasks were a `same-different' classification task (Expt. 4), error detection tasks (Expt. 5A,B) and a change monitoring task (Expt. 6). I.R. was impaired in these non-emotional tasks except when the change affected the mode and the tempo of the excerpt, in which case I.R. performed close to normal. The results are discussed in relation to the possibility that emotional and non-emotional judgments are the products of distinct pathways.Music and emotion: perceptual determinants, immediacy, and isolation after brain damage - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An exercise-based randomized controlled trial on brain, cognition, physical health and mental health in overweight/obese children (ActiveBrains project): Rationale, design and methods - ScienceDirectAn exercise-based randomized controlled trial on brain, cognition, physical health and mental health in overweight/obese children (ActiveBrains project): Rationale, design and methods - ScienceDirectClinical trials.

Further, whereas there is evidence of changes in self-report measures of cognition following cognitive therapy, there has been little work that identifies the specific therapeutic techniques that may directly modify nonconscious implicit cognition among depressed individuals. Improving our understanding of the role of implicit cognition in depression and how to manage these cognitive processes may help add to the efficacy of cognitive therapy. We review the literature examining the association between implicit cognition and depression and then describe potential therapeutic strategies for managing nonconscious implicit cognition biases in depression. Finally, we propose future directions of study, including a proposed cognitive-interpersonal framework for understanding therapeutic interactions in managing implicit cognition biases.Implicit cognition and the maintenance and treatment of major depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Implicit cognition and the maintenance and treatment of major depression - ScienceDirectPreparation of this article was supported by a NARSAD Young Investigator Award given to Michael A.

The chapter focuses on ways of representing music scores for computer storage, retrieval, and manipulation, and includes a discussion of two representative music codes, encoding devices and software, and music printing. The chapter discusses computer applications in music composition and includes information about the Musical Instrument Digital Interface(MIDI) standard, digital sound synthesis, and computer-aided composition. The chapter presents a survey of computer applications in music research and includes discussions of database developments, data structures for music analysis, adaptations of artificial intelligence techniques and concepts from cognitive science, and research into expressive musical performance. This chapter describes efforts arising from Algorithmic composition (Al) research whose goal is the composition of music in stylistic imitation of earlier composers. The most promising approaches are those using grammatical approaches and connectionist networks. In conclusion, the chapter presents comments on the current situation in each of these areas and then address briefly three philosophical issues attending the use of computers by musicians.Computer Applications in Music Composition and Research - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Problem of Linguistic Analysis of Musical Metaphors at Lessons of Russian as a Foreign Language - ScienceDirectThe Problem of Linguistic Analysis of Musical Metaphors at Lessons of Russian as a Foreign Language - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of IECC 2015.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectPaired excerpts of lullabies and comparison songs from different areas of the world were presented to Western adult listeners, who were required to identify the lullaby in each pair. In Experiment 1, when presented with original field recordings, adults successfully differentiated the lullabies from the other songs. In Experiment 2, this effect was replicated with a more diverse sample of listeners. In addition, feedback about correct performance failed to improve the accuracy of lullaby identification. In Experiment 3, adults successfully identified the lullabies even when all songs were electronically filtered to remove the words. In Experiment 4, adults were unsuccessful in lullaby identification when the melodies were synthesized to remove residual cues associated with voice quality. However, performance on the synthesized materials was correlated with performance on the original materials. Parallels between infant-directed music and infant-directed speech are noted.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectThis research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the University of Toronto.Adults identify infant-directed music across cultures - ScienceDirectLaurel Trainor is now at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Great ape cognition and captive care: Can cognitive challenges enhance well-being? - ScienceDirectGreat ape cognition and captive care: Can cognitive challenges enhance well-being? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Decision Making as a Window on Cognition - ScienceDirectA decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on information and values associated with the possible outcomes. The process operates in a flexible timeframe that is free from the immediacy of evidence acquisition and the real time demands of action itself. Thus, it involves deliberation, planning, and strategizing. This Perspective focuses on perceptual decision making in nonhuman primates and the discovery of neural mechanisms that support accuracy, speed, and confidence in a decision. We suggest that these mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general, and we speculate about the challenges and directions before the field.An early Phase II randomised controlled trial testing the effect on persecutory delusions of using CBT to reduce negative cognitions about the self: The potential benefits of enhancing self confidence - ScienceDirectResearch has shown that paranoia may directly build on negative ideas about the self.

Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) can be both a target engagement biomarker for the NMDAR and a proxy measure of neurophysiological plasticity. This review covers the evidence for using NMDAR modulator and related compounds for enhancement of cognition, with a particular focus on early auditory processing/plasticity. Compounds covered include glycine site agonists, glycine and system A-type transporter inhibitors, d-amino acid oxidase inhibitors, memantine and nicotinic alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor agonists. As opposed to daily treatment studies focusing on schizophrenia in general, intermittent, non-daily treatment combining NMDAR modulators with neuroplasticity-based paradigms, using MMN as target-engagement biomarkers show promise as treatments to both remediate plasticity deficits and overall functional deficits.N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor modulators and related medications for the enhancement of auditory system plasticity in schizophrenia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectMusical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectN1 enhancement and MMN are influenced by pitch and rhythm musical structures.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectThe N1 enhancement reflects a basic sensory memory process.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectMMN shows independent but cooperative modules for pitch and rhythm dimensions.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectInvoluntary switch of attention associated with P3a reflects no musical modulation.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectMusic represents a complex form of human cognition. To what extent our auditory system is attuned to music is yet to be clearly understood. Our principal aim was to determine whether the neurophysiological operations underlying pre-attentive auditory change detection (N1 enhancement (N1e)/Mismatch Negativity (MMN)) and the subsequent involuntary attentional reallocation (P3a) towards infrequent sound omissions, are influenced by differences in musical content. Specifically, we intended to explore any interaction effects that rhythmic and pitch dimensions of musical organization may have over these processes. Results showed that both the N1e and MMN amplitudes were differentially influenced by rhythm and pitch dimensions. MMN latencies were shorter for musical structures containing both features. This suggests some neurocognitive independence between pitch and rhythm domains, but also calls for further address on possible interactions between both of them at the level of early, automatic auditory detection. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the N1e reflects basic sensory memory processes. Lastly, we show that the involuntary switch of attention associated with the P3a reflects a general-purpose mechanism not modulated by musical features. Altogether, the N1e/MMN/P3a complex elicited by infrequent sound omissions revealed evidence of musical influence over early stages of auditory perception.Musical rhythm and pitch: A differential effect on auditory dynamics as revealed by the N1/MMN/P3a complex - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cognition, motor skills and hippocampal neurogenesis in developing C57BL/6J mice - ScienceDirectMaternal intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) is critical during perinatal development of the brain.

Although the majority of these cases were published in the late nineteenth century, earlier reports exist and provide insights into the early thinking about the capacity to sing in aphasia, a topic that continues to the present day. The observation that some patients with aphasia and limited speech output were able to sing the texts of songs inspired scholars to examine the relationship between music and language. Early ideas about the capacity to sing were provided by well-known neurologists, such as John Hughlings Jackson and Adolf Kussmaul. The work of Herbert Spencer about the origins and function of music heavily influenced Jackson and others in their thinking about aphasia. This work also led to an increased interest in understanding music abilities in persons with aphasia and, later, in the brain mechanisms of music. The chapter provides a background as to why there was an interest in the capacity to sing in persons with aphasia and what influenced early thinking on this topic.Some early cases of aphasia and the capacity to sing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Bolder, happier, smarter: The role of extraversion in positive mood and cognition - ScienceDirectBolder, happier, smarter: The role of extraversion in positive mood and cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Expression of emotion in voice and music - ScienceDirectVocal communication of emotion is biologically adaptive for socially living species and has therefore evolved in a phylogenetically continuous manner. Human affect bursts or interjections can be considered close parallels to animal affect vocalizations. The development of speech, unique to the human species, has relied on the voice as a carrier signal, and thus emotion effects on the voice become audible during speech. This article reviews (a) the evidence on listeners' ability to accurately identify a speaker's emotion from voice cues alone, (b) the research efforts trying to isolate the acoustic features that determine listener judgments, and (c) the findings on actual acoustic concomitants of a speaker's emotional state (real or portrayed by actors). Finally, based on speculations about the joint origin of speech and vocal music in nonlinguistic affect vocalizations, similarities of emotion expression in speech and music are discussed.Expression of emotion in voice and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Expression of emotion in voice and music - ScienceDirectThe distracting effects of vocal and instrumental music on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extraverts - ScienceDirectThis study examined the effects of vocal and instrumental music upon the performance of introverts and extraverts on three cognitive tasks. In the presence of either vocal or instrumental music, or in silence, introverts and extraverts sixth form pupils (N=144) completed a reading comprehension, a logic problem and a coding task. An interaction was predicted such that instrumental music would impair and enhance the test performance of introverts and extraverts, respectively, and that these effects would be magnified in the vocal music condition. No significant interactions were found, although there was a trend for the introverts to be impaired by the introduction of music to the environment and extraverts to be enhanced by it, particularly on the reading and coding tasks. A main effect of extraversion was found in the reading comprehension task and nearly in the coding task (p<0.06). There was a condition effect on the logic task with subjects doing best in the presence of instrumental music. Experimental explanations for the lack of predicted interactions are offered.

In Rank 1 culture (preliterate), music evolves through control over rhythm. Rank 2 culture (literacy) gains control over melodic structure, whereas Rank 3 culture (Renaissance and after) adds harmonic elaboration to rhythm and melody. Within the twentieth century, jazz has followed a similar course, with rhythmic elaboration coming first in traditional jazz, then melodic control emerging in swing, and harmonic control with bop. Both classical music and jazz have much straining beyond the limits of Rank 3 harmonic control, but no clear Rank 4 forms (typified in some aspects by the computer age) have yet evolved.Stages in the evolution of music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectEpilepsy is both a disease of the brain and the mind.Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectFirst of two papers with extended summaries of selected presentationsThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectBased on Third International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and MindThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectThird International Congress on Epilepsy, Brain and Mind: Part 1 - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.On the origins of organology: Franz Joseph Gall and a girl named Bianchi - ScienceDirectOn the origins of organology: Franz Joseph Gall and a girl named Bianchi - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Computer music and computer-based musicology - ScienceDirectThe study of music at universities in the U.K. divides into a number of musicological subjects, together with composition, some performing activity and training in advanced musical skills. Various musical applications involving computer-based technology are found in industry, and electroacoustic music is important commercially as well as artistically. Most universities use this technology to teach composition and related topics.Computer music and computer-based musicology - ScienceDirectThe use of computers in teaching musicological subjects is less well advanced, but some work, especially in music analysis, is supported by software.

The question of how musical sounds can have such profound emotional and rewarding effects has been a topic of interest throughout generations. At a fundamental level, listening to music involves tracking a series of sound events over time. Because humans are experts in pattern recognition, temporal predictions are constantly generated, creating a sense of anticipation. We summarize how complex cognitive abilities and cortical processes integrate with fundamental subcortical reward and motivation systems in the brain to give rise to musical pleasure. This work builds on previous theoretical models that emphasize the role of prediction in music appreciation by integrating these ideas with recent neuroscientific evidence.Predictions and the brain: how musical sounds become rewarding - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Implicit Puritanism in American moral cognition - ScienceDirectThree studies provide evidence that the judgments and behaviors of contemporary Americans are implicitly influenced by traditional Puritan-Protestant values regarding work and sex. American participants were less likely to display traditional values regarding sexuality when implicitly primed to deliberate, as opposed to intuition and neutral primes. British participants made judgments reflecting comparatively liberal sexual values regardless of prime condition (Study 1). Implicitly priming words related to divine salvation led Americans, but not Canadians, to work harder on an assigned task (Study 2). Moreover, work and sex values appear linked in an overarching American ethos. Asian-Americans responded to an implicit work prime by rejecting revealing clothing and sexually charged dancing, but only when their American cultural identity was first made salient (Study 3). These effects were observed not only among devout American Protestants, but also non-Protestant and less religious Americans.Implicit Puritanism in American moral cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Multi-paradigm software environment for the real-time processing of sound, music and multimedia - ScienceDirectMulti-paradigm software environment for the real-time processing of sound, music and multimedia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Affective guidance of intelligent agents: How emotion controls cognition - ScienceDirectAffective guidance of intelligent agents: How emotion controls cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectMusic performance anxiety (MPA) is a persistent and distressing experience that involves apprehension linked with musical performance in public (individual or collective). Anxious individuals concentrate their anxiety in situations that involve social scrutiny, favoring distorted, dysfunctional, and negative interpretations of that situation followed by experiences of physiological symptoms associated with the exposure. The most commonly used substances in the pharmacological management of MPA are beta-blockers and benzodiazepines. However, these options are not fully efficient and cause relevant side effects that interfere mainly with performance. Therefore, investigations on alternative substances to treat MPA are highly opportune.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectTo assess the acute effects of oxytocin (OT) on physiological and cognitive variables during an experimental model of simulated performance.A single dose of oxytocin on music performance anxiety: Results involving a situation of simulated performance - ScienceDirectWe assessed 12 musicians with MPA pre-treated with intranasal OT (24 UI) or placebo in a crossover trial involving an experimental situation of public performance.

The non-target condition consisted of four-chord harmonic chord sequences, while the target condition was manifested by a partially violating third chord and a resolving fourth chord. The results showed that the specific mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited in the resolving chord is as robust as that elicited in the partially violating chord. Moreover, the P3b (P300) elicited in the resolving chord was smaller than the one in the violating chord. Taken together these data indicates that the human brain pre-attentatively may be able to anticipate a subsequent resolving chord when music expectation is generated by a partially violating chord.Pre-attentive mental processing of music expectation: Event-related potentials of a partially violating and resolving paradigm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Too much control can hurt: A threaded cognition model of the attentional blink - ScienceDirectToo much control can hurt: A threaded cognition model of the attentional blink - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Too much control can hurt: A threaded cognition model of the attentional blink - ScienceDirectMarc Schipper is currently at the Department of Human Neurobiology, University of Bremen.Effects of individualized music on confused and agitated elderly patients - ScienceDirectThe Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold Model in conjunction with an identified theoretical basis provides a framework for the use of individualized music in individuals with Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DAT). The effects of individualized music is explored in five elderly patients who are confused and agitated and residing in a long-term care facility. The Modified Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory is used to measure the outcome. The immediate and 1-hour residual effects suggest the potential of individualized music as an alternative approach to the management of agitation in confused elderly patients.Effects of individualized music on confused and agitated elderly patients - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Skills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectIn this paper we attempt to characterize the key differences and points of convergence between two contemporary approaches to the relationship between culture and cognition in sociology which we label the toolkit and strong practice theory perspectives. We follow recent work at the intersection of culture and cognition in attempting to explicitly formulate the cognitive underpinnings of these two approaches in terms of the assumptions that they make about cultural acquisition, transmission and externalization. Our analysis suggests that in spite of very important differences in emphasis and explanatory range, toolkit and strong practice-theoretical approaches are complementary, although the specific types of modal situation for which each of them is best suited need to be more clearly specified. We develop a framework that shows how the two approaches can be deployed in conjunction as well as specifying the modal settings and situations that each will be more likely to handle best as well as those in which they will run into trouble.Skills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Skills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectSkills, toolkits, contexts and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural sociology - ScienceDirectMichael Strand is a doctoral student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame.

It is therefore commonly thought that elements of culture evolve through natural selection. However, natural selection was proposed to explain how change accumulates despite lack of inheritance of acquired traits, as occurs with template-mediated replication. It cannot accommodate a process with significant retention of acquired or horizontally (e.g. socially) transmitted traits. Moreover, elements of culture cannot be treated as discrete lineages because they constantly interact and influence one another. It is proposed that what evolves through culture is the mind; ideas and artifacts are merely reflections of its current evolved state. Interacting minds transform (in part) through a non-Darwinian autopoietic process similar to that by which early life evolved, involving not survival of the fittest but actualization of their potential.The cultural evolution of socially situated cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A software architecture for sound and music processing - ScienceDirectThis paper introduces a software architecture for the representation and real-time processing of sound and music, based on Artificial Intelligence techniques. In particular, a system able to store and process music and sounds at different levels of abstraction, and to carry out plans for manipulating this material according to the user's goals is described. This system is able to generate new music pieces as well as manipulate existent ones, on the basis of given material: to this end, it provides also formal analysis capabilities on both music and sounds for extracting information useful in subsequent synthesis processes.A software architecture for sound and music processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A software architecture for sound and music processing - ScienceDirectThis work has been supported by the Progetto Finalizzato Sistemi Informatici e Calcolo Parallelo of the Italian Research Council, under grant no. 90.00716.PF69.Impact of positive and anxious mood on implicit alcohol-related cognitions in internally motivated undergraduate drinkers - ScienceDirectWe explored the impact of musically induced positive and anxious mood on the implicit alcohol-related cognitions of 48 undergraduate students who drink either to enhance positive mood states (EM) or to cope with anxiety (CM-anxiety). Participants completed a post-mood induction computerized alcohol Stroop task that taps implicit alcohol-related cognitions. As hypothesized, CM-anxiety participants in the anxious (but not those in the positive) mood condition showed longer colour-naming latencies for alcohol (vs. non-alcohol) targets (i.e., an attentional bias toward alcohol-related stimuli). Also conforming to expectation was the finding that EM participants in the positive (but not those in the anxious) mood condition displayed longer colour-naming latencies for (i.e., an attentional bias toward) alcohol (vs. non-alcohol) target words.Impact of positive and anxious mood on implicit alcohol-related cognitions in internally motivated undergraduate drinkers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectThe effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectDuring naturalistic viewing, suspense suppressed peripheral visual processing.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectSuspense produced increases in the stimulus-driven ventral attention network.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectThere were concurrent decreases in the internally focused default-mode network.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectRecall performance was better for events at high versus low suspense moments.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectWe tested the hypothesis that, during naturalistic viewing, moments of increasing narrative suspense narrow the scope of attentional focus. We also tested how changes in the emotional congruency of the music would affect brain responses to suspense, as well as subsequent memory for narrative events. In our study, participants viewed suspenseful film excerpts while brain activation was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated that suspense produced a pattern of activation consistent with the attention-narrowing hypothesis. For example, we observed decreased activation in the anterior calcarine sulcus, which processes the visual periphery, and increased activity in nodes of the ventral attention network and decreased activity in nodes of the default mode network. Memory recall was more accurate for high suspense than low suspense moments, but did not differ by soundtrack congruency. These findings provide neural evidence that perceptual, attentional, and memory processes respond to suspense on a moment-by-moment basis.The effect of visual and musical suspense on brain activation and memory during naturalistic viewing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music in the evolution of the mind - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectTo test for pre-attentive auditory discrimination skills in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians.Pre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectPre-attentive auditory discrimination skill in Indian classical vocal musicians and non-musicians - ScienceDirectExactly 50 participants, out of which the experimental group had 25 adult Indian classical vocal musicians and 25 age-matched non-musicians served as the control group, were included in the study.

This bio-social-cultural theory is based on the assumption that organisms are dynamic systems which interact with one another and their environment and are themselves composed of dynamic internal relations at several levels. Special emphasis will be placed upon these internal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory. The human individual organism is emphasized because in its experiential activity over time it is the site of integration for social, and cultural stimuli and because of its unique properties among living things. The primary disciplines for our discussion are drawn from the biological, social, and humanistic sciences and several concrete examples are given from each science.An essay on the evolution of cognition: Constructing a theoretical conceptual framework - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An on-line method in studying music parsing - ScienceDirectListening to music entails the construction of a mental representation based on partial and ambiguous information. This study examines an experimental method that reflects such parsing decisions on-line by detecting the cognitive load resulting from temporary parsing failures. The method investigated was a divided attention paradigm in which listening to music was the primary task and click detection was a concurrent secondary task. It was hypothesized that increasing the complexity of the primary task by introducing an unprepared chromatic modulation results in an increase in response latencies to a click presented immediately after the modulatory shift. The support of this prediction by musicians' data provides evidence for the sensitivity of the paradigm. The failure of non-musicians to reflect the expected load is attributed to their attention-allocation strategy. These results are discussed in terms of their implications on the view of the musical parser as deterministic.An on-line method in studying music parsing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An on-line method in studying music parsing - ScienceDirectThe present study was carried out in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Master's degrees in Psychology and Music of the first author.

We examine here to what extent amusic adults, who have experienced pitch perception difficulties all their lives, still maintain some ability to perceive emotions from music. Amusic and control participants judged the emotions expressed by unfamiliar musical clips intended to convey happiness, sadness, fear and peacefulness (Experiment 1A). Surprisingly, most amusic individuals showed normal recognition of the four emotions tested here. This preserved ability was not due to some peculiarities of the music, since the amusic individuals showed a typical deficit in perceiving pitch violations intentionally inserted in the same clips (Experiment 1B). In Experiment 2, we tested the use of two major structural determinants of musical emotions: tempo and mode. Neutralization of tempo had the same effect on both amusics' and controls' emotional ratings. In contrast, amusics did not respond to a change of mode as markedly as controls did. Moreover, unlike the control participants, amusics' judgments were not influenced by subtle differences in pitch, such as the number of semitones changed by the mode manipulation. Instead, amusics showed normal sensitivity to fluctuations in energy, to pulse clarity, and to timbre differences, such as roughness. Amusics even showed sensitivity to key clarity and to large mean pitch differences in distinguishing happy from sad music. Thus, the pitch perception deficit experienced by amusic adults had only mild consequences on emotional judgments. In sum, emotional responses to music may be possible in this condition.Sensitivity to musical emotions in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sensitivity to musical emotions in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectAll authors contributed equally to the work.Prayer, cognition, and culture - ScienceDirectReligious texts, symbols, and practices have long been recognized as important aspects of culture, and yet they are less often the focus of empirical observation than are crude indicators obtained in surveys (such as religious preference and attendance). Prayer is one such topic: widely practiced, and yet treated mostly without regard to its cognitive content or cultural framing. Eleven empirical studies are presented here which examine prayers and prayer-related aspects of religion in contexts including advocacy groups, hospitals, congregations, the Internet, homilies in mosques, religious television, children's books, art, testimonials, inspirational guides, and interviews. The studies illuminate methods and data for studying cultural content of these kinds and draw connections with recent work in cognitive sociology and cognitive anthropology.Prayer, cognition, and culture - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prayer, cognition, and culture - ScienceDirectRobert Wuthnow is Andlinger Professor of Sociology and Director of the Center for the Study of Religion at Princeton University.

In Parkinson disease (PD), defective internal timing within the brain has been linked to impaired beat discrimination, and may contribute to a loss of ability to maintain a steady gait rhythm. Less rhythmic gait is inherently less efficient, and this may lead to gait impairment including reduced speed, cadence, and stride length, as well as increased variability. While external rhythmic auditory stimulation (e.g. a metronome beat) is well-established as an effective tool to stabilize gait in PD, little is known about whether self-generated cues such as singing have the same beneficial effect on gait in PD. Thus, we compared gait patterns of 23 people with mild to moderate PD under five cued conditions: uncued, music only, singing only, singing with music, and a verbal dual-task condition. In our single-session study, singing while walking did not significantly alter velocity, cadence, or stride length, indicating that it was not excessively demanding for people with PD. In addition, walking was less variable when singing than during other cued conditions. This was further supported by the comparison between singing trials and a verbal dual-task condition. In contrast to singing, the verbal dual-task negatively affected gait performance. These findings suggest that singing holds promise as an effective cueing technique that may be as good as or better than traditional cueing techniques for improving gait among people with PD.The feasibility of singing to improve gait in Parkinson disease - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are there pre-existing neural, cognitive, or motoric markers for musical ability? - ScienceDirectAre there pre-existing neural, cognitive, or motoric markers for musical ability? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A developmental study of the affective value of tempo and mode in music - ScienceDirectA developmental study of the affective value of tempo and mode in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectTheory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectYoung remitted bipolar patients show decoding deficits in ecologically valid stimuli.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectRemitted bipolar patients show no reasoning deficits.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectMood induction deteriorates ToM reasoning in bipolar patients and healthy controls.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectTo date, research concerning Theory of Mind (ToM) in remitted bipolar disorder (rBD) has yielded inconclusive results. This may be a result of methodological shortcomings and the failure to consider relevant third variables. Furthermore, studies using ecologically valid stimuli are rare. This study examines ToM in rBD patients, using ecologically valid stimuli. Additionally, the effects of sad mood induction (MI) as well as of age and gender are considered.Theory of mind in remitted bipolar disorder: Younger patients struggle in tasks of higher ecological validity - ScienceDirectThe sample comprises N = 44 rBD patients (rBDPs) and N = 40 healthy controls (HCs).

This review aimed to evaluate strategies to support adherence among people with MCI or Dementia and was completed in Nottingham/UK in 2017. A narrative synthesis was used to investigate the effectiveness or usefulness of adherence support strategies. Fifteen adherence support strategies were used including theoretical underpinning (programmes based on behavior change theories), individual tailoring, worksheets and exercise booklets, goal setting, phone calls or reminders, newsletters, support to overcome exercise barriers, information, adaptation periods, individual supervision, support for clinicians, group setting, music, accelerometers/pedometers and emphasis on enjoyable activities. Music was the only strategy that was investigated in a comparative design but was found to be effective only for those who were generally interested in participating in activities. A wide range of adherence support strategies are being included in exercise interventions for people with MCI or dementia, but the evidence regarding their effectiveness is limited.Sexual arousal and rhythmic synchronization: A possible effect of vasopressin - ScienceDirectMusic is ubiquitous. Yet, its biological relevance is still an ongoing debate. Supporting the view that music had an ancestral role in courtship displays, a pilot study presented here provides preliminary evidence on the link between music and sexual selection. The underlying hypothesis is based on the fact that the sexually dimorphic neuropeptide vasopressin has its receptors in the part of the brain involved in music and dance performance (the basal ganglia), and its concentrations rise during sexual arousal in men. In addition, music, dance, and courtship phenotypes seem to be in part regulated by vasopressin and its genes. Hence, to test this hypothesis, a rhythmic synchronization task was employed here on one male subject during sexual arousal. Results revealed a significant effect of sexual arousal on rhythm synchronization. This is the first report that empirically supports the hypothesis on the role of music in sexual selection. Further studies are clearly required.Sexual arousal and rhythmic synchronization: A possible effect of vasopressin - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Does domain knowledge moderate involvement of working memory capacity in higher-level cognition? A test of three models - ScienceDirectResearch suggests that both working memory capacity and domain knowledge contribute to individual differences in higher-level cognition. This study evaluated three hypotheses concerning the interplay between these factors. The compensation hypothesis predicts that domain knowledge attenuates the influence of working memory capacity on higher-level cognition, whereas the rich-get-richer hypothesis predicts that working memory capacity enhances use of domain knowledge. The independent influences hypothesis states simply that working memory capacity and domain knowledge make additive contributions to higher-level cognition. Participants representing wide ranges of working memory capacity and knowledge of baseball performed tasks that emphasized keeping track of information in a dynamic environment. The baseball task involved tracking the movements of baseball players on a baseball diamond. The spaceship task was structurally isomorphic to this task but its content was arbitrary. Results revealed greater use of baseball knowledge in the baseball task than in the spaceship task. However, even at high levels of baseball knowledge, this knowledge use did not alter the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance. This finding is inconsistent with compensation and rich-get-richer hypotheses. Instead, it suggests that working memory capacity and domain knowledge may operate independently under certain conditions.Does domain knowledge moderate involvement of working memory capacity in higher-level cognition?

Based on recent affect-cognition theories we demonstrate for the first time that mild negative mood increased communicators' use of ingratiatory tactics such as flattery, conformity and self-promotion (Exp. 1). Experiment 2 further confirmed that ingratiatory messages written in a negative mood were more effective and resulted in more positive interpersonal evaluations than messages written in a positive mood. Experiment 3 found that negative mood also improved recipients' willingness to accept realistic ingratiation. An analysis of response latencies (Exps. 1 and 3) and recall (Exp. 3), and mediational analyses showed that these effects were consistent with negative mood promoting longer and more attentive processing by both senders and recipients. The theoretical implications of these results for recent affect-cognition theories are considered, and the practical implications of these findings for everyday strategic communication and interpersonal behavior are discussed.Mood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mood effects on ingratiation: Affective influences on producing and responding to ingratiating messages - ScienceDirectSupport from the Australian Research Council to Joseph Forgas is gratefully acknowledged.Flagship stores for FMCG national brands: Do they improve brand cognitions and create favorable consumer reactions? - ScienceDirectNational brands have begun to engage in direct distribution, displaying the brand in its own biotope. Such operation of flagship stores is one means of forward verticalization. From samples of visitors to two flagship stores of fast-moving consumer goods brands, this study analyzes the effects of the flagship store visit on brand experience, brand equity, brand attachment, and loyalty. In the low-involvement FMCG context, flagship stores are useful for reinforcing brand experience. However, flagship store-fueled brand experience does not necessarily lead to favorable consumer reactions; its effect on future purchases is mediated by both brand equity and brand attachment.Flagship stores for FMCG national brands: Do they improve brand cognitions and create favorable consumer reactions? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectThe behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectA recent appreciation of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has emerged.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectThis review probes recent examinations of the relationship between dFC and cognition.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectPromising directions include cognitive/clinical relevance and computational modeling.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectRecent advances in neuroimaging methods and analysis have led to an expanding body of research that investigates how large-scale brain network organization dynamically adapts to changes in one's environment, including both internal state changes and external stimulation. It is now possible to detect changes in functional connectivity that occur on the order of seconds, both during an unconstrained resting state and during the performance of constrained cognitive tasks. It is thought that these dynamic, time-varying changes in functional connectivity, often referred to as dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), include features that are relevant to behavior and cognition. This review summarizes four aspects of the nascent literature directly testing that assumption: 1) how changes in functional network organization on the order of task blocks relate to differences in task demands and to cognitive ability; 2) how differences in dFC variability between different contexts relate to cognitive demands and behavioral performance; 3) how ongoing fluctuations in dFC impact perception and attention; and 4) how different patterns of dFC correspond to individual differences in cognition. The review ends by discussing promising directions for future research in this field. First, it comments on how dFC analyses can help to elucidate the mechanisms of healthy cognition. Next, it describes how dFC processes may be disrupted in disease, and how probing such dysfunction can increase understanding of neural etiology, as well as behavioral and cognitive impairments, observed in psychiatric and neurologic populations. Last, it considers the potential for computational models to uncover neuronal mechanisms of dFC, and how both healthy cognition and disease emerge from network dynamics.The behavioral and cognitive relevance of time-varying, dynamic changes in functional connectivity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectWhile there is sustained effort to refine the models and to further decrypt the neuronal underpinnings of cerebral music perception, empirical investigations on the associations of music perception with diagnoses others than focal brain damage need to be amplified.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectIn the present study, a validated and standardized clinical test of musical ability was applied to a sample of severely depressed patients. Basic musical capacities of rhythm, melody and pitch perception, recognition of emotions, and musical memory were evaluated and compared to matched healthy controls and reassessed in a follow-up examination after clinical remission.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe sample size is small, in particular in the follow-up study.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectThe results clearly revealed a significant reduction of musical ability in patients with depression.

Along with significant decrease of depressive symptoms, the patients significantly improved with respect to musical ability. These findings suggest a systematic impact of depression on musical ability, they are of importance for the application of music therapy in depressive patients and for the function of music to improve their quality of life.The impact of depression on musical ability - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Impact of ambient odors on mall shoppers' emotions, cognition, and spending: A test of competitive causal theories - ScienceDirectImpact of ambient odors on mall shoppers' emotions, cognition, and spending: A test of competitive causal theories - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Event-related potentials, cognition, and behavior: A biological approach - ScienceDirectThe prevailing cognitive-psychological accounts of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) assume that ERP components manifest information processing operations leading from stimulus to response. Since this view encounters numerous difficulties already analyzed in previous studies, an alternative view is presented here that regards cortical control of behavior as a repetitive sensorimotor cycle consisting of two phases: (i) feedforward anticipation and (ii) feedback cortical performance. This view allows us to interpret in an integrative manner numerous data obtained from very different domains of ERP studies: from biophysics of ERP waves to their relationship to the processing of language, in which verbal behavior is viewed as likewise controlled by the same two basic control processes: feedforward (hypothesis building) and feedback (hypothesis checking). The proposed approach is intentionally simplified, explaining numerous effects on the basis of few assumptions and relating several levels of analysis: neurophysiology, macroelectrical processes (i.e. ERPs), cognition and behavior. It can, therefore, be regarded as a first approximation to a general theory of ERPs.Event-related potentials, cognition, and behavior: A biological approach - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study - ScienceDirectCognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectLifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectHigher antipsychotic exposure related to poorer cognition in midlife schizophrenia.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectPotential biases related to this naturalistic design may contribute to the effects.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectHigher antipsychotic doses may negatively affect cognitive course in schizophrenia.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectPreventing or attenuating cognitive recovery may be an explanation for the results.Lifetime antipsychotic medication and cognitive performance in schizophrenia at age 43 years in a general population birth cohort - ScienceDirectThis naturalistic study analysed the association between cumulative lifetime antipsychotic dose and cognition in schizophrenia after an average of 16.5 years of illness. Sixty participants with schizophrenia and 191 controls from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 were assessed at age 43 years with a neurocognitive test battery. Cumulative lifetime antipsychotic dose-years were collected from medical records and interviews. The association between antipsychotic dose-years and a cognitive composite score based on principal component analysis was analysed using linear regression. Higher lifetime antipsychotic dose-years were significantly associated with poorer cognitive composite score, when adjusted for gender, onset age and lifetime hospital treatment days. The effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics did not differ. This is the first report of an association between cumulative lifetime antipsychotic dose and global cognition in midlife schizophrenia. Based on these data, higher lifetime antipsychotic dose-years may be associated with poorer cognitive performance at age 43 years. Potential biases related to the naturalistic design may partly explain the results; nonetheless, it is possible that large antipsychotic doses harm cognition in schizophrenia in the long-term.The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study was to determine whether preferences for enhanced and exaggerated bass in popular and more traditional forms of music are related to personality and gender differences. To test hypothesized relationships 21 pairs of musical selections were presented to undergraduate volunteers. Selections were randomly played in either normal or in enhanced bass modes. Personality was measured with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Revised, with Ss included in analysis if they scored in the highest or lowest quartile of the three superfactors measured by this instrument. Results showed that Psychoticism, gender, and Extraversion are all positively related to preference for enhanced bass. The results of gender are maintained even if the tendency for elevated Pscores in males are statistically controlled. Potential biobehavioural explanations for these findings are discussed as well as directions for future research.The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music processing at L.I.M. - ScienceDirectThis paper is a brief overview of the research and didactic activities of the Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale (L.I.M.) of the University of Milan.

Results showed that while music likeability influenced both wait-length evaluation and mood, only mood contributed to subjects' evaluation of their overall experience.

Humans and songbirds share a number of features in the development of their auditory communication systems. These similarities invite comparisons between species in their auditory perceptual skills. Here, we summarized our experimental comparisons between humans (and other mammals) and songbirds (and other birds) in their use of pitch height and pitch chroma perception and discuss similarities and differences in other auditory perceptual abilities of these species. Specifically, we introduced a functional modular view, using pitch chroma and pitch height perception as examples, as a theoretical framework for the comparative study of auditory perception and perhaps all of the study of comparative cognition. We also contrasted phylogeny and adaptation as causal mechanisms in comparative cognition using examples from auditory perception.A comparative analysis of auditory perception in humans and songbirds: A modular approach - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectWhy epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectPeople with epilepsy are at risk for reduced social competences and quality of life.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectNeuropsychological deficits in social cognition may impede social interactions.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectNew diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are needed for better assessment and care.Why epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectWhy epilepsy challenges social life - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Taking stock of cognition enhancers - ScienceDirectAn increasing number of structurally heterogeneous compounds, which may act via very different categories of neuronal mechanisms, have been proposed to facilitate attentional abilities and acquisition, storage and retrieval of information, and/or to attenuate the impairements of such cognitive functions associated with age or dementia. In this article, Martin Sarter briefly reviews the data on putative cognition enhancers and examines the possible bases for the discrepancy between preclinical predictions of efficacy and the fact that unequivocal demonstration of drug-induced cognition enhancement in humans has only rarely been reported. Previous preclinical research strategies appear to have focused on the demonstration of drug effects in a wide variety of tests of uncertain validity, rather than on determination of the specific psychological and neurobiological processes affected by putative cognition enhancers. Some criteria are proposed for evaluating the validity of preclinical tests for cognition enhancers.Taking stock of cognition enhancers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The role of pitch and temporal diversity in the perception and production of musical sequences - ScienceDirectIn two experiments we explored how the dimensions of pitch and time contribute to the perception and production of musical sequences. We tested how dimensional diversity (the number of unique categories in each dimension) affects how pitch and time combine. In Experiment 1, 18 musically trained participants rated the complexity of sequences varying only in their diversity in pitch or time; a separate group of 18 pianists reproduced these sequences after listening to them without practice. Overall, sequences with more diversity were perceived as more complex, but pitch diversity influenced ratings more strongly than temporal diversity. Further, although participants perceived sequences with high levels of pitch diversity as more complex, errors were more common in the sequences with higher diversity in time. Sequences in Experiment 2 exhibited diversity in both pitch and time; diversity levels were a subset of those tested in Experiment 1. Again diversity affected complexity ratings and errors, but there were no statistical interactions between dimensions. Nonetheless, pitch diversity was the primary factor in determining perceived complexity, and again temporal errors occurred more often than pitch errors. Additionally, diversity in one dimension influenced error rates in the other dimension in that both error types were more frequent relative to Experiment 1. These results suggest that although pitch and time do not interact directly, they are nevertheless not processed in an informationally encapsulated manner. The findings also align with a dimensional salience hypothesis, in which pitch is prioritised in the processing of typical Western musical sequences.The role of pitch and temporal diversity in the perception and production of musical sequences - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music on consumers' temporal perceptions: Does time fly when you're having fun? - ScienceDirectThe perceived duration of a time period may be influenced by properties of environmental stimuli that fill the period. Because music is often present in consumer environments, we conducted an experiment to explore the influence of a musical stimulus property (modality) on listeners' estimates of the duration of a time period. Findings suggest that perceptions of duration are influenced by music in a way that contradicts conventional wisdom (i.e., the "time flies when you're having fun" hypothesis). Perceived duration was longest for subjects exposed to positively valenced (major key) music, and shortest for negatively valenced (atonal) music. Thus, time did not fly when an interval was filled with affectively positive stimulation. An alternative hypothesis based on attentional and retrieval processes is supported. Implications for the design of consumer environments and for future research are discussed.The influence of music on consumers' temporal perceptions: Does time fly when you're having fun? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An Associative Memorization Architecture of Extracted Musical Features from Audio Signals by Deep Learning Architecture - ScienceDirectIn this paper, we develop associative memorization architecture of the musical features from time sequential data of the music audio signals. This associative memorization architecture is constructed by using deep learning architecture. Challenging purpose of our research is the development of the new composition system that automatically creates a new music based on some existing music. How does a human composer make musical compositions or pieces? Generally speaking, music piece is generated by the cyclic analysis process and re-synthesis process of musical features in music creation procedures. This process can be simulated by learning models using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The first and critical problem is how to describe the music data, because, in those models, description format for this data has a great influence on learning performance and function. Almost of related works adopt symbolic representation methods of music data. However, we believe human composers never treat a music piece as a symbol. Therefore raw music audio signals are input to our system. The constructed associative model memorizes musical features of music audio signals, and regenerates sequential data of that music. Based on experimental results of memorizing music audio data, we verify the performances and effectiveness of our system.An Associative Memorization Architecture of Extracted Musical Features from Audio Signals by Deep Learning Architecture - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of scientific committee of Missouri University of Science and Technology.Dynamics of the knowledge instinct: Effects of incoherence on the cognitive system - ScienceDirectWe successfully replicated a study about aesthetic emotions in a different socio-cultural environment. The present results suggest that incoherence is a strong inhibitor for aesthetic chills and verify a positive correlation between pleasure and meaning. These results allow for a scientific study of aesthetic emotions as it is now possible for the experimenter to have two groups of subjects, both exposed to the same stimulation, one group experiencing measurable aesthetic emotions whereas the other does not. We review the literature on the problem of both positive and negative psychogenic shivering and relate this phenomenon to the instinct of knowledge. We discuss the implications of our findings, stress the importance of studying the psychological and physiological effects of incoherence on the central nervous system, introduce a series of hypotheses to be tested in further research and conclude with a plausible explanation for the relation between temperature and cognition in humans.Dynamics of the knowledge instinct: Effects of incoherence on the cognitive system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An exploratory investigation of responses elicited by music varying in tempo, tonality, and texture - ScienceDirectThis study explores listeners' responses to music as a function of objective properties of musical sound. Original classical and pop-style compositions were produced with digital sound technology to provide orthogonal manipulations of musical tempo, tonality, and texture. Three dimensions (pleasure, arousal, surprise) emerged from the responses measured. Variance analyses found main effects of tempo on both pleasure and arousal, and main effects of tonality on pleasure and surprise. Texture moderated the influence of tempo such that a positive contribution to pleasure was observed for classical music, and a positive contribution to arousal was observed for pop-style music. Texture also moderated the influence of tonality on pleasure, with more pronounced reactions to tonal variations observed among listeners exposed to classical music. Implications for the use of music in consumer research and the interpretation of past music-related findings are discussed.An exploratory investigation of responses elicited by music varying in tempo, tonality, and texture - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An exploratory investigation of responses elicited by music varying in tempo, tonality, and texture - ScienceDirectRequests for reprints should be sent to James J.

We tested this claim that events optimally discrepant from a schema will be most pleasing. Experts and novices evaluated harmonic progressions at seven levels of syntactic prototypicality. Four results emerged: (1) even novices were extremely sensitive to syntactic atypicality; (2) all subjects found atypical progressions more interesting and complex; (3) novices and undergraduate music students preferred harmonic prototypes, contrary to most aesthetic theories; (4) only music graduate students preferred atypical progressions. We discuss the striking sensitivity of novices to harmonic syntax. We describe differences between an aesthetic theory based on information and uncertainty, and one based on schemas and schema divergence. We also consider the tonal conservatism of most subjects. This conservatism constraints aesthetic theories, and may have implications for music's stylistic evolution.Aesthetic preference and syntactic prototypicality in music: 'Tis the gift to be simple - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Aesthetic preference and syntactic prototypicality in music: 'Tis the gift to be simple - ScienceDirectWe thank John V.

Such effects would be expected if reading comprehension depends on the maintenance of phonological information in short-term memory. The first three experiments demonstrated that unattended speech but not music interfered with reading comprehension while unattended music had a greater interfering effect than speech on a music identification task. Experiments 4 and 5 showed that the detrimental effect of the speech backgrounds on reading was due to their semantic rather than their phonological properties. The failure to find a phonological interference effect argues against a role for phonological short-term memory in reading comprehension.Reading comprehension in the presence of unattended speech and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reading comprehension in the presence of unattended speech and music - ScienceDirectPreparation of this research article was supported by National Institutes of Health (NINCDS) Grant 19652 to Randi C.

To test this prediction, 36 individuals were asked to anticipate and perform a public-speaking task. During anticipation, negative self-focused cognitions or relaxation were experimentally induced while self-reported anxiety, autonomic arousal (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance level), and acoustic eye-blink startle response were assessed. As predicted, negative self-focused cognitions mediated the effects of trait social anxiety on self-reported anxiety and heart rate variability during negative anticipation. Furthermore, trait social anxiety predicted increased startle amplitudes. These findings support a central assumption of the cognitive model of social anxiety.Negative self-focused cognitions mediate the effect of trait social anxiety on state anxiety - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Swayed by the music: Sampling bias towards musical preference distinguishes like from dislike decisions - ScienceDirectThis study investigated the interaction between sampling behavior and preference formation underlying subjective decision making for like and dislike decisions. Two-alternative forced-choice tasks were used with closely-matched musical excerpts and the participants were free to listen and re-listen, i.e. to sample and resample each excerpt, until they reached a decision. We predicted that for decisions involving resampling, a sampling bias would be observed before the moment of conscious decision for the like decision only. The results indeed showed a gradually increasing sampling bias favouring the choice (73%) before the moment of overt response for like decisions. Such a bias was absent for dislike decisions. Furthermore, the participants reported stronger relative preferences for like decisions as compared to dislike decisions. This study demonstrated distinct differences in preference formation between like and dislike decisions, both in the implicit orienting/sampling processes prior to the conscious decision and in the subjective evaluation afterwards.Swayed by the music: Sampling bias towards musical preference distinguishes like from dislike decisions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Skill acquisition in music performance: relations between planning and temporal control - ScienceDirectSkill acquisition in music performance: relations between planning and temporal control - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music and Speech Processing in the First Year of Life - ScienceDirectThis chapter focuses on potential similarities between speech and music from the perspective of infant listeners. The stimuli of concern are sound sequences rather than single sounds, despite the predominant research focusing on the latter class of stimuli. The exclusion of single sounds can be justified on a number of grounds. First, several comprehensive reviews of infants' ability to perceive single speech and non-speech sounds are available. Second, evidence indicates that global patterns of speech are more salient in the pre-linguistic period than are individual speech segments. In the non-speech domain, evidence also indicates that infants proceed from global processing of auditory patterns to local processing of pattern details. In drawing parallels between speech and music, the chapter focuses on two principal issues: the input provided by caregivers for their infants and the processing of such input by infant listeners. Much of the work to be reported, particularly in the musical domain, is relatively recent.

However, neither potential creativity nor primary process content were significantly correlated with either psychoticism or openness to experience. An exploratory factor analysis, though, suggests that creativity, primary process cognition, extraversion, and psychoticism are interrelated.

EEG was recorded from 19 sites (10-20systems) in different states of brain activity; induced by emotionally valance music stimulus and also during no-task resting states. Then, we compared the EEG complexity of the rest condition with each emotional states. After that we determined the locations in which correlation dimension was changed in different states through one-way ANOVA test. In this study four excerpts of music from both Iranian traditional music and Western classical music, two negative valance and two positive valance pieces, were selected according to the results of Psychological papers.Performance anxiety, social phobia, and setting effects in instrumental music students - ScienceDirectPerformance anxiety has long been recognized as a problem for musicians. This study aims to assess the role of situational factors involved in music performance anxiety. Performance anxiety of 32 music students was assessed by measuring self-reported anxiety in different performance settings, as well as the students' level of experience, their degree of trait-anxiety, and their degree of social phobia. Performance setting was found to be a critical factor in performance in general and on the influence of social phobia in particular. These results have implications for future research, treatment methods, and the understanding of the relationship between performance anxiety and social phobia.Performance anxiety, social phobia, and setting effects in instrumental music students - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Bridging cognition, the brain and molecular genetics: evidence from Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectWilliams syndrome (WMS) is a rare sporadic disorder that yields a distinctive profile of medical, cognitive, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic characteristics. The cognitive hallmark of WMS is a dissociation between language and face processing (relative strengths) and spatial cognition (profound impairment). Individuals with WMS also tend to be overly social, behavior that is opposite to that seen in autism. A genetic hallmark of WMS is a deletion on chromosome band 7q11.23. Williams syndrome is also associated with specific neuromorphological and neurophysiological profiles: proportional sparing of frontal, limbic and neocerebellar structures is seen using MRI; and abnormal functional organization of the neural systems that underlie both language and face processing is revealed through studies using event-related potentials. The non-uniformity in the cognitive, neuromorphological and neurophysiological domains of WMS make it a compelling model for elucidating the relationships between cognition, the brain and, ultimately, the genes.Bridging cognition, the brain and molecular genetics: evidence from Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Senses make sense: An individualized multisensory stimulation for dementia - ScienceDirectNonpharmacologic interventions have been recommended as first-line treatments for dementia, and multisensory stimulation environment has been used as a non-pharmacological treatment to dementia patients in the last decade. However, the clinical effect of multisensory stimulation environment remains temporary and uncertain. Individualized medicine has been suggested to hold great promise in medicine, and it should be equally important for dementia. Reminiscence integrating individual experiences into therapeutic schemes has shown potential in the field of improving cognitive functions and depressive symptoms for dementia patients, and interactive music also demonstrated a positive outcome by using individualized music for the hearing aspect. We therefore hypothesize that an individualized multisensory stimulation in a natural and realistic environment integrating personal experience may be an effective intervention for patients suffering from dementia.Senses make sense: An individualized multisensory stimulation for dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A social Bayesian brain: How social knowledge can shape visual perception - ScienceDirectA social Bayesian brain: How social knowledge can shape visual perception - ScienceDirectSocial contextual knowledge can shape perception.A social Bayesian brain: How social knowledge can shape visual perception - ScienceDirectA Bayesian approach explains how high-level social factors change perception.A social Bayesian brain: How social knowledge can shape visual perception - ScienceDirectThis framework also provides new experimental implications for social cognition.A social Bayesian brain: How social knowledge can shape visual perception - ScienceDirectA social Bayesian brain: How social knowledge can shape visual perception - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectFrom everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectA multi-mechanism framework for emotional responses to music is presented.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectFrom everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectEmotions may occur in parallel with aesthetic judgments or as a result of them.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectAesthetic judgments are assumed to involve individual sets of weighted criteria.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectThe framework can reconcile previously distinct approaches to musical emotions.From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: Towards a unified theory of musical emotions - ScienceDirectHigh-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research - ScienceDirectHigh-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research - ScienceDirectHigh-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of musical experience on verbal memory in Williams syndrome: Evidence from a novel word learning task - ScienceDirectEffect of musical experience on verbal memory in Williams syndrome: Evidence from a novel word learning task - ScienceDirectEffect of musical experience on verbal memory in Williams syndrome: Evidence from a novel word learning task - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectTo describe the recruitment and baseline results of the Community of Voices study that aims to examine the effect of a community choir intervention on the health and well-being of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectRecruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectRecruitment and baseline characteristics of the Community of Voices choir study to promote the health and well-being of diverse older adults - ScienceDirectOutreach and recruitment methods used in the Community of Voices trial facilitated enrollment of a large proportion of minority and lower-SES older adults in the final sample.

The distinction between episodic and semantic autobiographical memory is particularly informative in this regard. Psychological interventions, particularly those involving reminiscence or music, have led to differential effects on episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. We propose that executive function is a key mediator of psychological therapies on autobiographical memory. We also highlight that interventions that alleviate stress and improve mood, including in major depression, can enhance autobiographical memory. Future research employing more longitudinal approaches and examining moderating factors such as gender and education level will deepen our understanding of changes in AM in later life, enhance our theoretical understanding of the neuroscience of AM and ageing, and help to develop better targeted interventions for preserving AM in older adults.Autobiographical memory, the ageing brain and mechanisms of psychological interventions - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (109KB)Download full-size imageAutobiographical memory, the ageing brain and mechanisms of psychological interventions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition and the temporal arts: Investigating audience response to dance using PDAs that record continuous data during live performance - ScienceDirectCognition and the temporal arts: Investigating audience response to dance using PDAs that record continuous data during live performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectMusical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectWe examined motor system activity while listening to high- and low-groove music.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectNo differences in MEPs occurred between low-groove music and a noise control.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectHigh-groove music modulated MEPs, but in different directions for musicians and non-musicians.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectWith groove music, MEPs were larger on-beat than off-beat, only for the musicians.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectMusical training modulates the effects of high-groove music on the motor system.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectMusical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical groove modulates motor cortex excitability: A TMS investigation - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally.Preliminary report of the sleep effect of music therapy in Alzheimer's disease - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectThe cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectWe compare findings of frontoparietal activation across four cognitive functions.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectWe argue that this activation partly reflects internal attention processes.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectTask-specific frontoparietal activations are related to internal representations.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectWe develop a neural model of cognitive functions emerging from internal attention.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectNeuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported findings of activation in frontoparietal regions that largely overlap across various cognitive functions. Part of this frontoparietal activation has been interpreted as reflecting attentional mechanisms that can adaptively be directed towards external stimulation as well as internal representations (internal attention), thereby generating the experience of distinct cognitive functions. Nevertheless, findings of material- and task-specific activation in frontal and parietal regions challenge this internal attention hypothesis and have been used to support more modular hypotheses of cognitive function. The aim of this review is twofold: First, it discusses evidence in support of the concept of internal attention and the so-called dorsal attention network (DAN) as its neural source with respect to three cognitive functions (working memory, episodic retrieval, and mental imagery). While DAN activation in all three functions has been separately linked to internal attention, a comprehensive and integrative review has so far been lacking. Second, the review examines findings of material- and process-specific activation within frontoparietal regions, arguing that these results are well compatible with the internal attention account of frontoparietal activation. A new model of cognition is presented, proposing that supposedly different cognitive concepts actually rely on similar attentional network dynamics to maintain, reactivate and newly create internal representations of stimuli in various modalities. Attentional as well as representational mechanisms are assigned to frontal and parietal regions, positing that some regions are implicated in the allocation of attentional resources to perceptual or internal representations, but others are involved in the representational processes themselves.The cross-functional role of frontoparietal regions in cognition: internal attention as the overarching mechanism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.On the structure of dispositions.

Musicians and nonmusicians alike are commonly found to possess detailed implicit knowledge of musical structure which is acquired incidentally through interaction with large samples of music. This paper reports an experiment combining the methodology of artificial grammar learning with musical acquisition of melodic structure. Participants acquired knowledge of grammatical melodic structures under incidental learning conditions in both experimental and untrained control conditions. Subsequent analysis indicates a large effect of unsupervised online learning in the experimental and control group throughout the course of the testing phase suggesting an effective ongoing learning process. Musicians did not outperform nonmusicians, indicating that musical expertise is not advantageous for the learning of a new, unfamiliar melodic system. Confidence ratings suggest that participants became aware of the knowledge guiding their classification performance despite the incidental learning conditions.Incidental and online learning of melodic structure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Development of General Competencies within the Context of Teacher Training - ScienceDirectDevelopment of General Competencies within the Context of Teacher Training - ScienceDirectSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of WCES 2014.Cross-modal interactions in the perception of musical performance - ScienceDirectWe investigate the dynamics of sensory integration for perceiving musical performance, a complex natural behavior. Thirty musically trained participants saw, heard, or both saw and heard, performances by two clarinetists. All participants used a sliding potentiometer to make continuous judgments of tension (a measure correlated with emotional response) and continuous judgments of phrasing (a measure correlated with perceived musical structure) as performances were presented. The data analysis sought to reveal relations between the sensory modalities (vision and audition) and to quantify the effect of seeing the performances on participants' overall subjective experience of the music. In addition to traditional statistics, functional data analysis techniques were employed to analyze time-varying aspects of the data. The auditory and visual channels were found to convey similar experiences of phrasing but different experiences of tension through much of the performances. We found that visual information served both to augment and to reduce the experience of tension at different points in the musical piece (as revealed by functional linear modeling and functional significance testing). In addition, the musicians' movements served to extend the sense of phrasing, to cue the beginning of new phrases, to indicate musical interpretation, and to anticipate changes in emotional content. Evidence for an interaction effect suggests that there may exist an emergent quality when musical performances are both seen and heard. The investigation augments knowledge of human communicative processes spanning language and music, and involving multiple modalities of emotion and information transfer.Cross-modal interactions in the perception of musical performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The contribution of music vs instructions in the Musical Mood Induction Procedure - ScienceDirectThe contribution of music vs instructions in the Musical Mood Induction Procedure - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Special issue on Creativity and Cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Anticipation: Beyond synthetic biology and cognitive robotics - ScienceDirectThe aim of this paper is to propose that current robotic technologies cannot have intentional states any more than is feasible within the sensorimotor variant of embodied cognition. It argues that anticipation is an emerging concept that can provide a bridge between both the deepest philosophical theories about the nature of life and cognition and the empirical biological and cognitive sciences steeped in reductionist and Newtonian conceptions of causality.Anticipation: Beyond synthetic biology and cognitive robotics - ScienceDirectThe paper advocates that in order to move forward, cognitive robotics needs to embrace new platforms and a conceptual framework that will enable it to pursue, in a meaningful way, questions about autonomy and purposeful behaviour. We suggest that hybrid systems, part robotic and part cultures of neurones, offer experimental platforms where different dimensions of enactivism (sensorimotor, constitutive foundations of biological autonomy, including anticipation), and their relative contributions to cognition, can be investigated in an integrated way.Anticipation: Beyond synthetic biology and cognitive robotics - ScienceDirectA careful progression, mindful to the deep philosophical concerns but also respecting empirical evidence, will ultimately lead towards unifying theoretical and empirical biological sciences and may offer advancement where reductionist sciences have been so far faltering.Short-term plasticity in auditory cognition - ScienceDirectConverging lines of evidence suggest that auditory system short-term plasticity can enable several perceptual and cognitive functions that have been previously considered as relatively distinct phenomena. Here we review recent findings suggesting that auditory stimulation, auditory selective attention and cross-modal effects of visual stimulation each cause transient excitatory and (surround) inhibitory modulations in the auditory cortex. These modulations might adaptively tune hierarchically organized sound feature maps of the auditory cortex (e.g. tonotopy), thus filtering relevant sounds during rapidly changing environmental and task demands. This could support auditory sensory memory, pre-attentive detection of sound novelty, enhanced perception during selective attention, influence of visual processing on auditory perception and longer-term plastic changes associated with perceptual learning.Short-term plasticity in auditory cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music on social cognitive skills - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of music on social cognitive skills - ScienceDirectLilja Ulfarsdottir is a nurse therapist and a PhD student at University College Northampton.The influence of music on social cognitive skills - ScienceDirectPhilip Erwin is Reader in Psychology at UCN, and a Chartered Counselling Psychologist.Musical preferences and learning outcome of medical students in cadaver dissection laboratory: A Nigerian survey - ScienceDirectMusical preferences and learning outcome of medical students in cadaver dissection laboratory: A Nigerian survey - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Meta-analytic evidence for the non-modularity of pitch processing in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectA major theme driving research in congenital amusia is related to the modularity of this musical disorder, with two possible sources of the amusic pitch perception deficit. The first possibility is that the amusic deficit is due to a broad disorder of acoustic pitch processing that has the effect of disrupting downstream musical pitch processing, and the second is that amusia is specific to a musical pitch processing module. To interrogate these hypotheses, we performed a meta-analysis on two types of effect sizes contained within 42 studies in the amusia literature: the performance gap between amusics and controls on tasks of pitch discrimination, broadly defined, and the correlation between specifically acoustic pitch perception and musical pitch perception. To augment the correlation database, we also calculated this correlation using data from 106 participants tested by our own research group. We found strong evidence for the acoustic account of amusia. The magnitude of the performance gap was moderated by the size of pitch change, but not by whether the stimuli were composed of tones or speech. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between an individual's acoustic and musical pitch perception. However, individual cases show a double dissociation between acoustic and musical processing, which suggests that although most amusic cases are probably explainable by an acoustic deficit, there is heterogeneity within the disorder. Finally, we found that tonal language fluency does not influence the performance gap between amusics and controls, and that there was no evidence that amusics fare worse with pitch direction tasks than pitch discrimination tasks. These results constitute a quantitative review of the current literature of congenital amusia, and suggest several new directions for research, including the experimental induction of amusic behaviour through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the systematic exploration of the developmental trajectory of this disorder.Meta-analytic evidence for the non-modularity of pitch processing in congenital amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectHuman lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectReview of human lesion studies of vmPFC.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectvmPFC damage associated with dramatic changes in personality and behavior.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectDeficits in affect, decision-making, social conduct/cognition, and memory.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectFunctional impact of vmPFC lesion etiology, laterality, and age onset are discussed.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectvmPFC is critical for diverse aspects of adaptive function.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectStudies of neurological patients with focal lesions involving ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have demonstrated a critical role for this brain area in various aspects of cognition, emotion, and behavior. In this article, we review the key themes, methods, and findings from neuropsychological research on vmPFC lesion patients. Early case studies demonstrated profound disruptions in personality and behavior following vmPFC damage, including blunted affect, poor decision-making, and inappropriate social behavior. Subsequent laboratory investigations with groups of vmPFC lesion patients have revealed deficits in a host of interrelated functions, such as value-based decision-making, future and counterfactual thinking, physiological arousal to emotional stimuli, emotion recognition, empathy, moral judgment, and memory confabulation. The compendium of findings described here demonstrates that vmPFC is crucial for diverse aspects of adaptive function.Human lesion studies of ventromedial prefrontal cortex - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cerebral Lateralization of Familiar and Unfamiliar Music Perception in Nonmusicians: A Dual Task Approach - ScienceDirectIn a dual task procedure that controls for attentional trade-off effects, asymmetrical in terference effects were observed in dual task conditions of finger tapping and concurren processing of familiar and unfamiliar music. Laterality effects suggested that perception of orchestral presentations is largely lateralized to the left hemisphere in both males and females. In a second dual task condition of vocalization and music processing, both males and females displayed interference in speech production during concurrent music processing.

It can provide useful projective, diagnostic data and help to determine the suitability of music therapy as a treatment modality. Although this assessment was designed for young adolescents in particular, it has also been varied to suit other populations. The validity of this procedure would be determined by the systematic implementation of all tasks. This writter suggests changes in song lists or listening lists to realistically accommodate different age groups. It would necessitate careful documentation of musical/behavioral criteria indicators, as well as areas of assessment. When assessing a more disturbed or psychotic patient, the music therapist may choose to vary the order of tasks or do the assessment over a longer period of time.An individual music therapy assessment procedure for emotionally disturbed young adolescents - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An individual music therapy assessment procedure for emotionally disturbed young adolescents - ScienceDirectNancy Wells, Music Therapy Supervisor within the Expressive Therapy Department at Portsmouth Psychiatric Center, Portsmouth, VA, is also President of the Virginia Association for Music Therapy.

Later, Krause et al. reported of distinct ERD/ERS responses during an auditory memory task: the encoding of acoustic material elicited alpha-frequency ERS whereas retrieval or recognition of the same stimulus material evoked alpha ERD. The research group of Krause and co-workers has published several reports on acoustically evoked ERD/ERS responses utilizing various cognitive tasks and diverse stimuli. Recently, also clinical studies have been initiated. This chapter reviews, summarizes, and discusses the findings on cognition- and memory-related ERD/ERS responses specifically in the auditory stimulus modality.Cognition- and memory-related ERD/ERS responses in the auditory stimulus modality - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectThe effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectScore reading involves attending and interpreting multiple visual constituents.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectBeams are typically considered a graphic representation of metric chunking.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectThe investigation proposed that beams could enhance visual perception of contour.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectIn two studies participants judged the direction of notes, beams, and pitches; dimensions were congruent or incongruent.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectFindings confirmed that notes and beams are processed automatically during reading, and beams serve as informants of contour.The effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectThe effect of beam slope on the perception of melodic contour - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neurological basis of language and sequential cognition: Evidence from simulation, aphasia, and ERP studies - ScienceDirectThe current research addresses the hypothesis that certain aspects of sequential cognition have made substantial contributions to the human language processing capability, from a functional neurophysiology perspective. We first describe a cognitive sequence processing model that was developed based on the functional neuroanatomy of primate cortex and basal ganglia. We demonstrate how this model is capable of simulating the behavior of human infants in extracting serial, temporal and abstract structure from language-like sound sequences as revealed in recent psycholinguistic experiments. We then demonstrate how, through training, this model can perform adult level syntactic comprehension, based on dissociated processing streams for open vs. closed class words. The model subsequently predicts: (1) that impaired syntactic processing (as in agrammatic aphasia) will be associated with impairments in corresponding non-linguistic cognitive sequencing tasks, and (2) that neurophysiological processes (as revealed by ERPs) involved in syntactic processing should also be involved in the corresponding non-linguistic cognitive sequencing tasks. Data confirming these predictions are reviewed. We conclude that the study of sequential cognition will provide a new paradigm for the investigation of the neurophysiological bases of language.Neurological basis of language and sequential cognition: Evidence from simulation, aphasia, and ERP studies - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evidenced-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation for Persons With Multiple Sclerosis: An Updated Review of the Literature From 2007 to 2016 - ScienceDirectEvidenced-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation for Persons With Multiple Sclerosis: An Updated Review of the Literature From 2007 to 2016 - ScienceDirectSearches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were conducted with a combination of the following terms: attention, awareness, cognition, cognitive, communication, executive, executive function, language, learning, memory, perception, problem solving, reasoning, rehabilitation, remediation, training, processing speed, and working memory.

As it has been hypothesized that toxic effect of substances on the brain was responsible for the impairments described, studying addictions without substances could be of interest to confirm this hypothesis. Twenty-two male pathological gamblers were compared to 22 male healthy controls matched for age and education level on non-verbal emotion perception tasks including faces, voices, and musical excerpts. Depression and anxiety levels were controlled for. Pathological gamblers significantly underestimated the intensity of peacefulness in music, and overall they were less accurate when reading emotion in voices and faces. They also overestimated emotional intensity in neutral voices and faces. Although anxiety levels did account for accuracy problems when detecting fear in voices and for overestimating emotions in neutral faces, anxiety levels did not explain the range of deficits observed. This is the first study showing non-verbal perception deficits in a purely behavioural addiction. These findings show that deficits in decoding non-verbal signals are associated with addictive behaviours per se, and are not due solely to toxic effects of substances on the brain.Impaired non-verbal emotion processing in Pathological Gamblers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectExamining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectWe discuss a framework for brain plasticity.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectWe review the impact of musical training at different levels of the neural system.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectSeveral potential neurophysiological mechanisms could underlie music-induced brain plasticity.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectWe propose that cognitive transfer effects can be conceptualized as a multidimensional continuum.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectTraining programs aimed to alleviate or improve auditory-cognitive abilities have either experienced mixed success or remain to be fully validated. The limited benefits of such regimens are largely attributable to our weak understanding of (i) how (and which) interventions provide the most robust and long lasting improvements to cognitive and perceptual abilities and (ii) how the neural mechanisms which underlie such abilities are positively modified by certain activities and experience. Recent studies indicate that music training provides robust, long-lasting biological benefits to auditory function. Importantly, the behavioral advantages conferred by musical experience extend beyond simple enhancements to perceptual abilities and even impact non-auditory functions necessary for higher-order aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, intelligence). Collectively, preliminary findings indicate that alternative forms of arts engagement (e.g., visual arts training) may not yield such widespread enhancements, suggesting that music expertise uniquely taps and refines a hierarchy of brain networks subserving a variety of auditory as well as domain-general cognitive mechanisms. We infer that transfer from specific music experience to broad cognitive benefit might be mediated by the degree to which a listener's musical training tunes lower- (e.g., perceptual) and higher-order executive functions, and the coordination between these processes. Ultimately, understanding the broad impact of music on the brain will not only provide a more holistic picture of auditory processing and plasticity, but may help inform and tailor remediation and training programs designed to improve perceptual and cognitive benefits in human listeners.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Music: A window into the hearing brain>.Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectAdults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of dementia. Therefore, we proposed an intervention called the Square-stepping exercise (SSE) program to mitigate this risk. Our primary aim was to determine the feasibility of SSE in adults with T2DM and self-reported cognitive complaints. Our secondary aim was to determine if 24-weeks of SSE improved cognition. Our tertiary aim was to determine if SSE improved antisaccade reaction time, which is a measure of executive-related oculomotor control.Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectAdults >49 years with T2DM and self-reported cognitive complaints were randomized to: SSE group (2x/week for 24-weeks of SSE) or control group. Feasibility was assessed by recruitment and attendance. Participants were assessed at baseline, 12-weeks, and 24-weeks on global cognitive function, memory, planning, reasoning, and concentration via computer-based cognitive battery (Cambridge Brain Sciences), and antisaccade reaction time (baseline and 24-weeks).Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectParticipants in SSE group, were [mean, (SD)]: 65.9 (5.2) years old, 33% female, and BMI 33.3 kg/m2 (4.8) (n=12). Participants in control group, were: 71.2 (6.9) years old, 31% female, and BMI 31.9 kg/m2 (4.6) (n=13). Over 24-weeks, attendance was 70.2% (SD 17.2) for 4/12 participants. There were 4 withdrawals and 1 adverse event. There were no differences in global cognitive functioning. The SSE group improved on planning domain change scores between 12- and 24-weeks (F=5.8, p=0.03, p2=0.28), compared to controls. In the SSE group, we found a non-significant improvement in antisaccade reaction time of 38 ms (SD 16), n=2, compared to 9 ms (SD 45) in the control group, n=8.Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectSSE should be evaluated further to improve its feasibility in older adults with T2DM. This study provides preliminary evidence that SSE improves executive function in adults with T2DM and self-reported cognitive complaints.Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectAuthor DisclosuresResults From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectThe authors have nothing to disclose.Results From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectFunding StatementResults From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectResults From a Feasibility Study of Square-Stepping Exercise in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes and a Self-Reported Cognitive Complaint to Improve Global Cognitive Functioning - ScienceDirectThe Canadian Diabetes Association is the registered owner of the name Diabetes Canada.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectEncoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectMRI encoding is used to investigate the cortical representation of sound timbre.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectWe compare a subjective timbre model to spectral/spectrotemporal modulation models.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectThe timbre model outperforms spectral, but not spectrotemporal modulation models.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectThe timbre model outperforms all other models in parts of early auditory cortex.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectResults support a distributed encoding of timbre dimensions in auditory cortex.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectTimbre, or sound quality, is a crucial but poorly understood dimension of auditory perception that is important in describing speech, music, and environmental sounds. The present study investigates the cortical representation of different timbral dimensions. Encoding models have typically incorporated the physical characteristics of sounds as features when attempting to understand their neural representation with functional MRI. Here we test an encoding model that is based on five subjectively derived dimensions of timbre to predict cortical responses to natural orchestral sounds. Results show that this timbre model can outperform other models based on spectral characteristics, and can perform as well as a complex joint spectrotemporal modulation model. In cortical regions at the medial border of Heschl's gyrus, bilaterally, and regions at its posterior adjacency in the right hemisphere, the timbre model outperforms even the complex joint spectrotemporal modulation model. These findings suggest that the responses of cortical neuronal populations in auditory cortex may reflect the encoding of perceptual timbre dimensions.Encoding of natural timbre dimensions in human auditory cortex - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN provides an objective assessment of CI functioning in children, adolescents and adults.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectIn infants with CI, the MMN provides the only means for assessing CI improvement.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN may be used as a tool in developing and testing novel rehabilitation procedures.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN may objectively assess the discrimination of different features of music in CI users.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectMulti-feature MMN paradigms permit assessment of discrimination of several auditory dimensions.The MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectThe MMN as a viable and objective marker of auditory development in CI users - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe minority of individuals afflicted with lifelong musical pitch deficits have been increasingly studied because they can help to reveal what is specific to music processing at all levels from behavior and brain to genes.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe core deficit of congenital amusia is characterized by a lack of awareness of acquired musical pitch knowledge.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectThe amusic brain shows abnormalities in neural transmission between the auditory cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus in the right cerebral hemisphere.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectConcerted activity over relatively distant specialized cortical regions is a fundamental neurobiological principle of human cognition.Neurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectNeurobiology of Congenital Amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Effects of Sentence-Level Context, Prior Word Knowledge, and Need for Cognition on Information Processing of Technical Language in Print Ads - ScienceDirectAn experiment was conducted to examine the effects of sentence-level context, prior word knowledge, and need for cognition on responses to print ads for technical products. Words and phrases that help readers understand technical language in context increased the supportive arguments generated in response to ads, whereas prior word knowledge and need for cognition primarily influenced neutral thoughts. Only explanatory language facilitated the comprehension of product information. Explanatory language led to an increase in attitudes and purchase intent. Need for cognition had a positive influence on attitude formation when the context language was ambiguous, but decreased attitude formation when the context language was explanatory. Results are consistent with predictions guided by a comprehension elaboration model of persuasion.The Effects of Sentence-Level Context, Prior Word Knowledge, and Need for Cognition on Information Processing of Technical Language in Print Ads - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hearing what the body feels: Auditory encoding of rhythmic movement - ScienceDirectHearing what the body feels: Auditory encoding of rhythmic movement - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hearing what the body feels: Auditory encoding of rhythmic movement - ScienceDirectThis manuscript was accepted under the editorship of Jacques Mehler.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectNormality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectRepresentations of normality are central to many aspects of cognition.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectFour studies explored the factors that influence normality representations.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectBoth descriptive and prescriptive judgments influenced normality representations.Normality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectNormality: Part descriptive, part prescriptive - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reactions to music, touch and object presentation in the final stage of dementia.

Participants were asked to choose emotional descriptors that expressed the feelings that were induced in them by each excerpt. We hypothesized that in the specific case of sad music, patients with MDD would describe the music more vividly than HC participants.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectPatients with MDD chose fewer emotional labels than controls in response to angry, scary, and happy excerpts. Patients with MDD and controls chose similar emotional labels in response to sad music, but patients with MDD chose more labels in response to sad music than to any other excerpt, while controls demonstrated the exact opposite pattern.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectThese findings are in line with clinical descriptions of patients with MDD as demonstrating difficulties in verbalizing their emotions. Their intensified response to sad music is in accordance with their focus on sad cues. The use of sad music in psychotherapy is thus recommended as means of bypassing the verbal barrier experienced by patients with MDD.Finding words for emotions: The reactions of patients with major depressive disorder towards various musical excerpts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music therapy research II: Research methods suitable for music therapy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music therapy research II: Research methods suitable for music therapy - ScienceDirectPhenomenology of rhythm in design - ScienceDirectRhythm in design, as explored in this research, is proposed to be the result of cognitive performance generated stylistically by creators and recognized consciously by beholders. This study describes the phenomenon of rhythm; how it is created; the factors that comprise rhythm; the types of rhythms created by human cognition of repetition, and why repetition is recognized as a part of human cognition. Images of seven buildings designed by Alvar Aalto are used to demonstrate the creation and expression of rhythm in building compositions. Evidence gathered in this research explains that rhythm in design is a result of the design method consciously applied by human cognition of repetition. Rules of generating the phenomena of rhythm are also summarized. Designers could apply these rules to generate harmonious patterns through the effective usage of repetition. In sum, rhythm is ingrained in the human conscience and therefore should be a key component of design applied universally.Phenomenology of rhythm in design - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Southeast University.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectCorrelations between subjective, conscious, spontaneous cognitions and EEG power spectral profiles were investigated in 20 normal volunteers (2 sessions each) during relaxation-drowsiness-sleep onset. Four-channel EEG (temporal-parietal and parietal-central, left and right) was continuously recorded. The subjects were prompted 15 times per session to give brief reports of their ongoing thoughts. The reports were rated on 23 scales, and the 16 seconds of EEG recording preceding the prompts were spectral analyzed. Canonical correlation analysis was applied to the data (23 cognition ratings and 124 EEG spectral values for each of the 538 prompts). Four of the 23 pairs of canonical EEG variables and cognition variables were significant (p < 0.016) with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 to 0.62. The four pairs of canonical variables showed distinctive features in EEG spectra and cognition styles. The results demonstrate ruleful correspondances between EEG states and spontaneous, conscious, covert, cognitive-emotional states in a no-input, no-task, no-response paradigm.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectHome institution: Department of Drug Safety Assessment, SANDOZ, Basel, Switzerland.Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.Effects of a best-possible-self mental imagery exercise on mood and dysfunctional attitudes - ScienceDirectEffects of a best-possible-self mental imagery exercise on mood and dysfunctional attitudes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Can concurrent verbalization reveal design cognition? - ScienceDirectCan concurrent verbalization reveal design cognition? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music draws attention to the left and speech draws attention to the right - ScienceDirectProviding free-field music input prompts right-handers to attend to their left side in a loudness-matching task that requires no musical analysis.

Yet standard creativity tasks cannot reliably isolate these two types of cognitive processes, making it difficult to understand the relation between the two and the roles of their corresponding brain networks in creative cognition. In this study we used a behavioral and neuroimaging approach in an effort to establish chain free association (FA) tasks as a relevant method for directly investigating spontaneous associative thinking and its role in creative cognition. We further examined the relation between performance on such tasks and intelligence. Participants completed common creativity tasks and then underwent fMRI scanning while producing FA chains. Instructions to participants that emphasized the spontaneous nature of the task, coupled with proper control conditions that were balanced for difficulty, enabled us to uncover spontaneous (as opposed to controlled) processes. To examine whether behavioral measures that can be derived from FA chains (associative fluency, associative flexibility and semantic remoteness between associations) are indicative of unconstrained spontaneous associative processing and are related to different aspects of verbal creativity and intelligence, scores on these measures were correlated with scores on creativity tasks and on an intelligence task, and with brain activity. We found that: (1) the Default Mode Network (DMN), a network involved in self-generated and internally-directed thought, was more involved in chain FA than in other tasks expected to reflect more controlled forms of internally-directed thought, suggesting that the DMN involvement might be related to the unconstrained spontaneous nature of chain FA. Higher involvement of the left IFG, SFG, MFG under chain FA was also revealed; (2) higher scores on different behavioral measures from FA chains were related to higher activation of the DMN and to reduced activation of the left IFG, a major node in the executive function network; (3) behavioral measures from FA chains were correlated with different aspects of creative performance but not with intelligence. Taken together, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that chain FA involves associative spontaneous thinking. They further suggest that behavioral measures derived from chain FA could indicate patterns of unconstrained associative thinking, related to reduced cognitive control, that are relevant for creative ideation, and might be able to serve as a measure of these patterns.Chain Free Association, Creativity, and the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Chain Free Association, Creativity, and the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Psychology, Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology, Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzliya 46150, Israel.Chain Free Association, Creativity, and the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectPresent address: Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.Chain Free Association, Creativity, and the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectPresent address: The Functional MRI Center, Cognitive Neurology Clinic and Department of Neurology, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.Neuropsychological therapy and music geragogy for patients with mild-to-moderate dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A Spatial Dance to the Music of Time in the Leks of Long-Tailed Manakins - ScienceDirectA Spatial Dance to the Music of Time in the Leks of Long-Tailed Manakins - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.That note sounds wrong!

Age-related effects in processing of musical expectation - ScienceDirectPart of musical understanding and enjoyment stems from the ability to accurately predict what note (or one of a small set of notes) is likely to follow after hearing the first part of a melody. Selective violation of expectations can add to aesthetic response but radical or frequent violations are likely to be disliked or not comprehended. In this study we investigated whether a lifetime of exposure to music among untrained older adults would enhance their reaction to unexpected endings of unfamiliar melodies. Older and younger adults listened to melodies that had expected or unexpected ending notes, according to Western music theory. Ratings of goodness-of-fit were similar in the groups, as was ERP response to the note onset (N1). However, in later time windows (P200 and Late Positive Component), the amplitude of a response to unexpected and expected endings was both larger in older adults, corresponding to greater sensitivity, and more widespread in locus, consistent with a dedifferentiation pattern. Lateralization patterns also differed. We conclude that older adults refine their understanding of this important aspect of music throughout life, with the ability supported by changing patterns of neural activity.That note sounds wrong!

However, while this notion forms an important basis for psychotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of CD, there is still little direct empirical evidence for a role of altered affective and cognitive reactivity in CD. The present study therefore experimentally investigated affective and cognitive reactivity to two forms of negative mood induction in CD patients versus a healthy control sample (HC).Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectFor the general mood induction procedure, a combination of sad pictures and sad music was used, while for individualized mood induction, negative mood was induced by individualized scripts with autobiographical content. Both experiments included n = 15 CD patients versus n = 15 HC, respectively. Interactions between affective or cognitive reactivity and group were analyzed by repeated measurements ANOVAs.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectGeneral mood induction neither revealed affective nor cognitive reactivity in the patient group while the control group reported the expected decrease of positive affect [interaction (IA) affective reactivity x group: p = .011, cognitive reactivity x group: n.s.]. In contrast, individualized mood induction specifically increased affective reactivity (IA: p = .037) as well as the amount of dysfunctional cognitions in patients versus controls (IA: p = .014).Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectThe experiments were not balanced in a crossover design, causal conclusions are thus limited. Additionally, the differences to non-chronic forms of depression are still outstanding.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectThe results suggest that in patients with CD, specific emotional activation through autobiographical memories is a key factor in dysfunctional coping styles. Psychotherapeutic interventions aimed at modifying affective and cognitive reactivity are thus of high relevance in the treatment of CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evolution or culture, but music may soothe the savage breast.: Commentary on Leonid Perlovsky, Musical emotions: Functions, origins, evolution - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectOld songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectPeople process the meaning of song lyrics in natural song perception.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectPeople continue processing the meaning of lyrics even when they are familiar with the songs.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectSong lyrics may be different from regular speech.Old songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectOld songs can be as fresh as new: An ERP study on lyrics processing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The integration of cognition and emotion during infancy and early childhood: Regulatory processes associated with the development of working memory - ScienceDirectThis study was an attempt to integrate cognitive development (i.e., cognitive control) and emotional development (i.e., emotion regulation) in the first years of life. The construct of temperament was used to unify cognition and emotion because of its focus on attentional and regulatory behaviors. Children were seen at 8 months and 412-years of age in a study designed to examine the correlates of working memory development. Frontal brain electrical activity and temperament predicted working memory performance at 8 months. Similarly, frontal brain electrical activity, temperament, and language predicted working memory at age 412-years. Temperament in early childhood mediated the relation between infant temperament and early childhood working memory performance. These associated temperament characteristics highlight the value of early-learned regulatory and attentional behaviors and the impact of these early skills on later development.The integration of cognition and emotion during infancy and early childhood: Regulatory processes associated with the development of working memory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.An exploratory study of children's music ability - ScienceDirectThis research examined the relationships between children's musical ability and the physical and social environments of the home and school as well as the child characteristics of creativity and cognition. Teacher and parent ratings were included as measures of children's musical ability observed in the natural home and school settings, as comparisons to the standardized Primary Measures of Music Audiation (PMMA) measurement (Gordon, 1979). Sixty children between the ages of 4 and 6 and their parents participated in the study. The findings of this study include significant positive relationships of children's musical aptitude with fathers' attitude and encouragement, and the child characteristics of cognitive and creative abilities. Significant correlations of the PMMA were found with several physical environment variables.

Here, we used novel meta-analytic data-driven approaches to characterize the function and connectivity profile of ADHD-related dysfunctional regions consistently detected across studies.Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectWe first conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 24 task-based fMRI studies in adults with ADHD. Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on ~7500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional coactivation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling).Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectADHD-related hypoactivation was found in the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and the left temporal lobe to language semantics; both these regions clustered together on the basis of their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped to both executive function tasks and music-related processes.Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectOur study provides meta-analytic support to the hypothesis that, in addition to well-known deficits in typical executive functions, impairment in processes related to music perception/reproduction and language semantics may be involved in the pathophysiology of adult ADHD.Functional Decoding and Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMelodic expectancy influences the processing of prosodic expectancy.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusical expertise modulates pitch processing in music and language.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusicians have a more refined response to pitch.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectMusicians' neural responses are proportional to their level of musical expertise.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectPossible association between the P200 neural component and behavioural facilitation.Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation - ScienceDirectSocial Cognition: Some Historical and Theoretical Perspectives - ScienceDirectSocial cognition is established to serve as a new forum for the ever increasing numbers of investigations. This chapter examines the current theories of social cognition and the intellectual history out of which social cognition has arisen. It also reveals the pervasive and continuing influence of two generic traditions within psychology: associationism and constructionism. It is salutary in the development of social cognition to explore its intellectual history, its associationist, and its constructionist traditions to address the question of whether or not social cognition represents an important theoretical advance. In the chapter, the roots of associationism as well as its present application in social cognition research and the roots of constructionism and its present application in social cognition research are also explored. The central concerns of cognitive psychology are representation and processing. These issues require the building and testing of theoretical constructs and models. The formation or processing of representations is directly observed and introspection regarding cognitive processes is problematic. The chapter also focuses on those investigations of social cognition that explicitly apply associationist or constructionist theory.Social Cognition: Some Historical and Theoretical Perspectives - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Embodied Processes between Maths and Gross-motor Skills - ScienceDirectEmbodied Processes between Maths and Gross-motor Skills - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University.Cognitive priming in sung and instrumental music: Activation of inferior frontal cortex - ScienceDirectCognitive priming in sung and instrumental music: Activation of inferior frontal cortex - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical deficits and cortical thickness in people with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectMusical deficits and cortical thickness in people with schizophrenia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectAmbivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectConfigurations of inclusion, exclusion, and ambivalence define musical boundary forms.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectGenre measured indirectly by respondent classifications of favorite and least favorite artists.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectPrimary contrast in the musical field is drawing boundaries between versus within genres.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectSecondary contrast in the musical field defined by those who are indifferent to major genres.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectComparative netfield analysis connects individual-level and field-level analysis.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectThis study offers a reconceptualization of social and symbolic boundaries around music by specifying combinations of inclusion, exclusion, and ambivalence in musical tastes, producing eight ideal-typical forms of musical boundaries. These forms are investigated using data from a survey of students at the University of Mississippi measuring implicit boundary processes through respondent genre classifications of favorite and least favorite artists. These data are analyzed using comparative netfield analysis, a combination of comparative and relational methods that provides a mixed methods framework for connecting interpretations of individual-level processes to a map of the socio-musical field. The main opposition found in this musical field is between divider and ambivalent boundary forms, i.e., those who draw boundaries between versus within genres. A secondary opposition is defined by those who are indifferent to major genres. Case studies suggest that musical boundaries are often organized around racialized and gendered genre categories. I draw implications for studies of omnivorousness, genre classification, and mixed methods analysis in cultural sociology.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ambivalence, indifference, distinction: A comparative netfield analysis of implicit musical boundaries - ScienceDirectJohn Sonnett is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Mississippi.

To deal with a continuously changing environment, living things have three choices: (1) evolve unvarying processes that usually succeed, (2) evolve genetically fixed effector, perceptual, and computational functions that are contingent on the environment, and (3) learn adaptive functions during their lifetimes. The theme of this chapter is the relation between (2) and (3): the nature of evolutionarily determined computational processes that support learning. The principal goal of this chapter has been to suggest that high-dimensional vector space computations based on empirical associations among very large numbers of components could be a close model of a fundamental computational basis of most learning in both verbal and perceptual domains. More powerful representational effects can be brought about by linear inductive combinations of the elements of very large vocabularies than has often been realized. Success of one such model to demonstrate many natural properties of language commonly assumed to be essentially more complex, nonlinear, and/or unlearned, along with evidence and argument that similar computations may serve similar roles in object recognition, are taken to reaffirm the possibility that a single underlying associational mechanism lies behind many more special and complex appearing cognitive phenomena.On the computational basis of learning and cognition: Arguments from LSA - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectPsychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLatinos improved on panic disorder severity and asthma control in both groups.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectCBT had greater improvements on asthma medication adherence than music-relaxation.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectImprovements in panic disorder severity were mediated by anxiety sensitivity in CBT.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectDepression was a mediator of change in panic disorder severity in music-relaxation.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectConfusion between panic and asthma symptoms can result in serious self-management errors. A cognitive behavior psychophysiological therapy (CBPT) intervention was culturally adapted for Latinos consisting of CBT for panic disorder (PD), asthma education, differentiation between panic and asthma symptoms, and heart rate variability biofeedback. An RCT compared CBPT to music and relaxation therapy (MRT), which included listening to relaxing music and paced breathing at resting respiration rates. Fifty-three Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) adults with asthma and PD were randomly assigned to CBPT or MRT for 8 weekly sessions. Both groups showed improvements in PD severity, asthma control, and several other anxiety and asthma outcome measures from baseline to post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. CBPT showed an advantage over MRT for improvement in adherence to inhaled corticosteroids. Improvements in PD severity were mediated by anxiety sensitivity in CBPT and by depression in MRT, although earlier levels of these mediators did not predict subsequent improvements. Attrition was high (40%) in both groups, albeit comparable to CBT studies targeting anxiety in Latinos. Additional strategies are needed to improve retention in this high-risk population. Both CBPT and MRT may be efficacious interventions for comorbid asthma-PD, and CBPT may offer additional benefits for improving medication adherence.Psychological treatment of comorbid asthma and panic disorder in Latino adults: Results from a randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectThe judgement of healthy subject rating the emotional expressions of a set of schematic drawn faces is validated (study 1) to examine the relationship between mood (depressed/elated) and judgement of emotional expressions of these faces (study 2).Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectStudy 1: 30 healthy subjects judged 12 faces with respect to the emotions they express (fear, happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, rejection and invitation). It was found that a particular face could reflect various emotions. All eigth emotions were reflected in the set of faces and the emotions were consensually judged. Moreover, gender differences in judgement could be established.Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectInduction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirect11 subjects who showed substantial differences in experienced depression after listening to the music were selected for further analysis. It was found that, when feeling more depressed, the subjects perceived more rejection/sadness in ambiguous faces (displaying less intensive emotions) and less invitation/happiness in clear faces. In addition, subjects saw more fear in clear faces that express less intensive emotions. Hence, results show a depression-related negative bias in the perception of facial displays.Induction of depressed and elated mood by music influences the perception of facial emotional expressions in healthy subjects - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.P-063: Relationship between oral health and cognition in older patients admitted in a medical ward of a general hospital - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The interplay of emotions and cognitions of consumers in the retail environment - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Apical dendrite activity in cognition and consciousness - ScienceDirectApical dendrite activity in cognition and consciousness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectThe style of a set of Swedish nursery tunes is described in terms of a generative rule system. A generative rule system producing melodically similar versions of an old Swedish folk song is also presented. Examples of melodies generated by these two rule systems are given.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectBoth these rule systems are similar in several respects. Thus, the marking of the hierarchical constituent structure seems to be one of the important principles in composing simple melodies.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectThe rule systems also show a number of similarities with the Chomsky & Halle (1968) generative phonology of English. For instance, the procedures used for deriving a stress contour from a tree diagram are almost identical. Moreover, in sentences as in melodies this stress, or prominence contour is of decisive importance to the generation of the surface structure, such as meter, harmony, and sequences of pitches. It is believed that such parallels between language and music reflect characteristics of man's perceptual and cognitive capacities.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectGenerative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectGenerative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectGenerative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Generative theories in language and music descriptions - ScienceDirectThe place of cognition in explanations of teaching: A dialog of interpretive and cognitive approaches - ScienceDirectThis debate contrasts interpretive and cognitive approaches to explaining teachers' thoughts and actions, exploring epistemological and ontological assumptions that broadly underlie research on teaching. Fundamental to the discussion is whether cognition should be construed as individual mental processing of privately held information structures or as a social event in which thinking is situated, shared, intersubjective, and practical. Also addressed is whether an effective explanation of teaching can rest mainly on an account of a teacher's cognition or whether it must attend equally to an examination of the place in which the teaching occurs and, if the latter, how place exerts its influence.The place of cognition in explanations of teaching: A dialog of interpretive and cognitive approaches - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The place of cognition in explanations of teaching: A dialog of interpretive and cognitive approaches - ScienceDirectThis paper is based upon a discussion (session 49.41) that took place at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Atlanta, 1993.

Abstraction is universal, but rationalization first appeared in ancient Greece, theorization in Renaissance Italy, and model building in twentieth-century Europe. These four processes employ the methods of metaphor, metalingual definition, algorithm, and control, respectively. The intellectual and practical achievements of populations guided by these several processes and exploiting their different mechanisms differ so greatly as to warrant separation into cultural ranks.

In light of the rapid (and often transitory) nature of auditory phenomena, in order to investigate the neurocomputational basis of auditory perception and cognition, a technique with high temporal resolution is appropriate. Here we briefly outline the utility of magnetoencephalography (MEG) for the study of the neural basis of audition. The basics of MEG are outlined in brief, and some of the most-used neural responses are described. We discuss the classic transient evoked fields (e.g., M100), responses elicited by change in a stimulus (e.g., pitch-onset response), the auditory steady-state response, and neural oscillations (e.g., theta-phase tracking). Because of the high temporal resolution and the good spatial resolution of MEG, paired with the convenient location of human auditory cortex for MEG-based recording, electromagnetic recording of this type is well suited to investigate various aspects from audition, from crafted laboratory experiments on pitch perception or scene analysis to naturalistic speech and music tasks.Electromagnetic recording of the auditory system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Investigating the Relationship Between Musical Training and Mathematical Thinking in Children - ScienceDirectInvestigating the Relationship Between Musical Training and Mathematical Thinking in Children - ScienceDirectApart from the specific musical-mathematical foci, the lesson content was kept as constant as possible within primary school settings.

Well-performed, systematic evidence-based research is largely lacking in this area and many studies include various forms of CAM with small patient numbers and a lack of standardization of the approaches studied. Taichi, Qigong, dance, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and other CAM therapies are reviewed and there is some evidence for the following: Taichi in sleep and PDQ39; dance in cognition, apathy, and a mild trend to improved fatigue; yoga in PDQ39; and acupuncture in depression, PDQ39, and sleep.Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Exercise in Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease - ScienceDirectExercise including occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) has been studied in motor symptoms of PD and balance but only with small studies with a mounting evidence base for use of exercise in NMS of PD including PDQ39, sleep, fatigue, depression, and some subsets of cognition. Studies of OT and PT largely show some benefit to depression, apathy, and anxiety. Sustainability of an improvement has not been shown given short duration of follow up. Finding optimal control groups and blind for these interventions is also an issue. This is a very important area of study since patients want to be self-empowered and they want guidance on which form of exercise is the best. Additionally, evidence for PT and OT in NMS would give added weight to get these interventions covered through medical insurance.Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Exercise in Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectTurning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectAge-related decline in hearing abilities impacts speech understanding.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectMusical training enhances hearing ability for musical and non-musical tasks.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectOlder adults benefit from musical training in processing speech in noise.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectEngagement in musical activity offset age-related decline in cognitive skills.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectAge-related decline in hearing abilities is a ubiquitous part of aging, and commonly impacts speech understanding, especially when there are competing sound sources. While such age effects are partially due to changes within the cochlea, difficulties typically exist beyond measurable hearing loss, suggesting that central brain processes, as opposed to simple peripheral mechanisms (e.g., hearing sensitivity), play a critical role in governing hearing abilities late into life. Current training regimens aimed to improve central auditory processing abilities have experienced limited success in promoting listening benefits. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that in young adults, musical training positively modifies neural mechanisms, providing robust, long-lasting improvements to hearing abilities as well as to non-auditory tasks that engage cognitive control. These results offer the encouraging possibility that musical training might be used to counteract age-related changes in auditory cognition commonly observed in older adults. Here, we reviewed studies that have examined the effects of age and musical experience on auditory cognition with an emphasis on auditory scene analysis. We infer that musical training may offer potential benefits to complex listening and might be utilized as a means to delay or even attenuate declines in auditory perception and cognition that often emerge later in life.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Music: A window into the hearing brain>.Turning down the noise: The benefit of musical training on the aging auditory brain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Spirituality, hope and music therapy in palliative care - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThe effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThis study demonstrates the differential effects of process- and outcome-focused thinking.The effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThe degree of mental simulation is positively influences on adoption of the branded app.The effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectInnovativeness and need for cognition affect adoption of the branded app.The effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThe mental simulation play an important role in attitude toward the brand.The effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThe results of MANOVA indicated that the three-way interaction affect dependent variables.The effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThe effects of mental simulations, innovativeness on intention to adopt brand application - ScienceDirectThe study demonstrates the effects of mental simulation, innovativeness, and need for cognition on adoption of the branded app. This experiment improves our understanding of how three-way interaction between the abovementioned factors affects the intention to adopt a new branded app. The results of a MANOVA indicated statistically significant effects of the abovementioned three-way interaction on the dependent variables.

An audio-visual integration study examined the effects of auditory emotion on visual (social/non-social) affect identification in individuals with WS and typically developing (TD) and developmentally delayed (DD) controls. The social bias in WS was hypothesized to manifest as an increased ability to process social than non-social affect, and a reduced auditory influence in social contexts. The control groups were hypothesized to perform similarly across conditions. The results showed that while participants with WS exhibited indistinguishable performance to TD controls in identifying facial affect, DD controls performed significantly more poorly. The TD group outperformed the WS and DD groups in identifying non-social affect. The results suggest that emotionally evocative music facilitated the ability of participants with WS to process emotional facial expressions. These surprisingly strong facial-processing skills in individuals with WS may have been due to the effects of combining social and music stimuli and to a reduction in anxiety due to the music in particular. Several directions for future research are suggested.Cross-modal influences of affect across social and non-social domains in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cross-modal influences of affect across social and non-social domains in individuals with Williams syndrome - ScienceDirectA.J.-P. and B.W.V. contributed equally to this work.Musical Interests and Abilities in Individuals with Developmental Disabilities - ScienceDirectThis chapter reviews studies of musicality in individuals with Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, and autism spectrum disorders. Music can be used to assess a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, motor, and affective processes. We discuss how the study of musicality contributes to our understanding of each of these syndromes, drawing connections to the underling neurobiology when possible. After consideration of the methodological limitations of previous studies, we make suggestions for future areas of research within this field. Research into musicality in these developmental disorders can contribute to overarching questions about music, including domain general versus domain-specific mechanisms, development of musical interest and skill, and musical enculturation. Implications for understanding both typical and atypical development are discussed.Musical Interests and Abilities in Individuals with Developmental Disabilities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectHappy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectThe research explores task-related promotional DS content.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectThe LC4MP and resource matching theory serve as theoretical foundation.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectThe presence of DS diminishes negative emotions in utilitarian shopping contexts.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectAffective DS content evokes the most positive emotions and cognitions.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectDS can create positive shopping experiences in utilitarian shopping situations.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectRecent research has identified digital signage (DS) as a promising element for creating atmospheric value. However, extant studies have explored shoppers' reactions to DS showing advertising content in hedonic shopping environments. Considering the potential of utilitarian shopping situations to evoke negative emotions, the current research investigates whether DS positively affects consumers' responses in task-oriented shopping situations. In doing so, it incorporates assumptions from the limited capacity model and resource matching theory into a theoretical framework to explain how task-relevant DS content influences impulse purchases and store loyalty. This relationship is mediated by emotional and cognitive processes. By drawing on findings from prior studies, this research further differentiates the effects of cognitive, affective, and mixed DS content on consumer responses. A field experiment tests the theoretically derived responses. The findings suggest that affective DS content creates positive emotions and increases impulsive purchases and store loyalty.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Happy grocery shopper: The creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content - ScienceDirectMarion Garaus, PhD, Marion Garaus is assistant professor in marketing at the Institute of Business Administration, University of Vienna, Austria.

We challenge this view by proposing an alternative approach to the cognitive foundations of social interactions. The central claim of this paper is that social cognition concerns the graded and dynamic process of alignment of individual minds, even in the absence of a shared goal. When individuals reciprocally exchange information about each other's minds processes of alignment unfold over time and across space, creating a social interaction. Not all cases of joint action involve such reciprocal exchange of information. To understand the nature of social interactions, then, we propose that attention should be focused on the manner in which people align words and thoughts, bodily postures and movements, in order to take one another into account and to make full use of socially relevant information.Alignment in social interactions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of relaxing music on agitation during meals among nursing home residents with severe cognitive impairment - ScienceDirectRelaxing music was hypothesized to buffer the general nolse level typically found in dining rooms of nursing homes, exert a calming effect, and thus reduce agitated behaviors among residents with severe cognitive impairment. Twenty-nine nursing home residents with severe cognitive deficits participated in a 4-week protocol in which, following baseline observations (week 1), relaxing music was introduced (week 2), removed (week 3), and reintroduced (week 4). Subjects were observed in terms of total number of behaviors of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory present during a given week, and the number of behaviors present on the subscales of aggressive, physically nonaggressive, verbally agitated, and hiding/hoarding behaviors. Significant reductions were observed on the cumulative incidence of total agitated behaviors (63.4%); as well as the cumulative incidence of physically nonaggressive behaviors (56.3%) and verbally agitated behaviors (74.5%). No significant reductions were noted in terms of aggressive behaviors and hiding/hoarding behaviors. Where significant reductions were achieved, a distinct pattern was observed. Agitation decreased during week 2, increased again during week 3, only to decrease again in week 4. In addition, variance effects were noted as well, as ranges and standard deviations of agitated behaviors narrowed over time. These findings are interpreted within Hall and Buckwalter's (1988) model of a progressively lowered stress threshold among dementia patients.Effects of relaxing music on agitation during meals among nursing home residents with severe cognitive impairment - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of relaxing music on agitation during meals among nursing home residents with severe cognitive impairment - ScienceDirectThis article was supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.Effects of alcohol consumption and alcohol susceptibility on cognition: a psychophysiological examination - ScienceDirectEffects of alcohol consumption and alcohol susceptibility on cognition: a psychophysiological examination - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music and Art in Medicine (MAM): A Medical Student Initiative to Improve Quality of Life (QOL) for Nursing Home (NH) and Assisted Living (AL) Residents - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Intelligence and the rest of cognition - ScienceDirectCognitive psychologists have become enamored with intelligence. Increasingly, the theories, findings, and methods of what is known as the information processing approach are being used in attempts to explain intelligence related phenomena. This article examines intelligence from a different perspective, which emphasizes domain-specific constraints on knowledge structures. It is argued that conceptions of what intelligence is and how it relates to the rest of cognition can vary considerably when viewed from the vantage points of these two perspectives. The constraints approach views intelligence as being closely related to a special subset of all of our cognitive abilities and as having unique distinguishing properties. It is also argued that the evaluation of any cognitive ability as being intelligent depends crucially on a prior specification of the formal constraints on the domain or domains of knowledge from which that ability originates.Intelligence and the rest of cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Intelligence and the rest of cognition - ScienceDirectPreparation of this paper and some of the research reported herein was supported by NSF grants BNS-78-06200 and BNS-81-02655 to the author.

The emerging field of improvisation neuroscience has implications not only for the study of artistic expertise, but also for understanding the neural underpinnings of domain-general processes such as motor control and language production. This review synthesizes functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) studies of musical improvisation, including vocal and instrumental improvisation, with samples of jazz pianists, classical musicians, freestyle rap artists, and non-musicians. A network of prefrontal brain regions commonly linked to improvisatory behavior is highlighted, including the pre-supplementary motor area, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal premotor cortex. Activation of premotor and lateral prefrontal regions suggests that a seemingly unconstrained behavior may actually benefit from motor planning and cognitive control. Yet activation of cortical midline regions points to a role of spontaneous cognition characteristic of the default network. Together, such results may reflect cooperation between large-scale brain networks associated with cognitive control and spontaneous thought. The improvisation literature is integrated with Pressing's theoretical model, and discussed within the broader context of research on the brain basis of creative cognition.The neuroscience of musical improvisation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectExposure to music may be useful in the P300 retest and avoid habituation.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectTo verify the influence of the exposure to different kinds of music in P300 in young females.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectClinical prospective.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectForty-five women aged from 20 to 36 years were evaluated. P300 was studied before and after musical stimulation with different rhythms. Brazilian songs, international songs, and classical music melodies were selected. Each song had its velocity altered and was named as fast and slow. Subjects were divided into 2 groups exposed to music: one group was exposed to the fast version and the other to the slow version. The control group not exposed to music and was evaluated within the same time period of the others.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectThere were statistically significant differences when comparing P300 amplitude in the first and third stimulation with the comparison group.Musical rhythms and their influence on P300 velocity in young females - ScienceDirectIn the same subject, several sequential registrations of P300 caused habituation, which was not seen during exposure to music before P300 recording.

While the nature of the creative process is under debate, many believe that creativity relies on real-time combinations of known neural and cognitive processes. One useful model of creativity comes from musical improvisation, such as in jazz, in which musicians spontaneously create novel sound sequences. Here we use jazz musicians to test the hypothesis that individuals with training in musical improvisation, which entails creative generation of musical ideas, might process expectancy differently. We compare jazz improvisers, non-improvising musicians, and non-musicians in the domain-general task of divergent thinking, as well as the musical task of preference ratings for chord progressions that vary in expectation while EEGs were recorded. Behavioral results showed for the first time that jazz musicians preferred unexpected chord progressions. ERP results showed that unexpected stimuli elicited larger early and mid-latency ERP responses (ERAN and P3b), followed by smaller long-latency responses (Late Positivity Potential) in jazz musicians. The amplitudes of these ERP components were significantly correlated with behavioral measures of fluency and originality on the divergent thinking task. Together, results highlight the role of expectancy in creativity.Jazz musicians reveal role of expectancy in human creativity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The perception of musical phrase structure: A cross-cultural ERP study - ScienceDirectThe perception of musical phrase structure: A cross-cultural ERP study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Two epistemologies: Music therapy and medicine in the treatment of dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Two epistemologies: Music therapy and medicine in the treatment of dementia - ScienceDirectTwo epistemologies: Music therapy and medicine in the treatment of dementia - ScienceDirectGudrun Aldridge is a music therapist.Explaining the ineffable - ScienceDirectExplaining the ineffable - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.NOVEL TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR IMPAIRED COGNITION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: COMBINING DIFFERENT MODES OF COGNITIVE REMEDIATION - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The structure of functional brain EEG network is sensitive to genre specific musical creativity: A study on jazz and classical piano music performance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Congenital amusia - ScienceDirectFor most people, music, like language, is acquired effortlessly in early life. But a few percent of the population have lifelong difficulties in the perception and production of music. In this chapter we discuss psycho-acoustic and behavioral studies that have attempted to delineate the nature of the auditory perceptual deficits in this group and consider whether these difficulties extend outside the musical domain. Finally, we review structural imaging studies in this group which point to subtle anomalies in temporal and frontal areas. We suggest that amusia can be considered a disorder of neural development, which has relatively specific consequences at the behavioral level. Studies of congenital amusia provide a unique window on the neurocognitive architecture of music processing.Congenital amusia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Animal Cognition: Multimodal Tactics of Orangutan Communication - ScienceDirectOrangutans select different tactics for repairing failed communication, depending upon how well they are understood: they repeat signals if they are partially understood and switch tactics entirely if completely misunderstood.Experimental Evidence for Synchronization to a Musical Beat in a Nonhuman Animal - ScienceDirectCreativity and consciousness: Music therapy in intensive care - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Creativity and consciousness: Music therapy in intensive care - ScienceDirectSpatial Agency Bias: Representing People in Space - ScienceDirectSpatial Agency Bias: Representing People in Space - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Chapter 21 Hypertext and reading cognition - ScienceDirectChapter 21 Hypertext and reading cognition - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Chapter 23 The musical brain - ScienceDirectChapter 23 The musical brain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.SY1.1 Gait, cognition and cholinergic system, is there a link? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music, psychology and psychotherapy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Music, psychology and psychotherapy - ScienceDirectEdward A.

It first reviews research that has identified ways in which animals and humans are similar and then reviews research that has identified ways in which animals differ from humans, with a focus on ways in which some animals have been shown to outperform humans.

Whether patients with SD also experience difficulty recognizing emotions conveyed by other media, such as music, is unclear. Prior studies have used excerpts of known music from classical or film repertoire but not unfamiliar melodies designed to convey distinct emotions. Patients with SD (n=11), Alzheimer's disease (n=12) and healthy control participants (n=20) underwent tests of emotion recognition in two modalities: unfamiliar musical tunes and unknown faces as well as volumetric MRI. Patients with SD were most impaired with the recognition of facial and musical emotions, particularly for negative emotions. Voxel-based morphometry showed that the labelling of emotions, regardless of modality, correlated with the degree of atrophy in the right temporal pole, amygdala and insula. The recognition of musical (but not facial) emotions was also associated with atrophy of the left anterior and inferior temporal lobe, which overlapped with regions correlating with standardized measures of verbal semantic memory. These findings highlight the common neural substrates supporting the processing of emotions by facial and musical stimuli but also indicate that the recognition of emotions from music draws upon brain regions that are associated with semantics in language.Brain correlates of musical and facial emotion recognition: Evidence from the dementias - ScienceDirectBrain correlates of musical and facial emotion recognition: Evidence from the dementias - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The dynamics of ontogeny: A neuroconstructivist perspective on genes, brains, cognition and behavior - ScienceDirectFor years, the view that the human cognitive system is as a Swiss army knife with innately specified functional modules that come online one by one or can be impaired independently of other modules, has dominated cognitive science. In this chapter, we start out by questioning this view and argue it needs to be replaced by a dynamic neuroconstructivist approach in which genes, brain, behavior, and environment interact multidirectionally throughout development. Using examples from the recent literature, we then highlight how a static modular view of the brain remains deeply ingrained in (1) behavioral, (2) neuroimaging, and (3) genetics research on typical and atypical cognitive development. Finally, we discuss future contributions of the neuroconstructivist approach to developmental research in particular, and cognitive neuroscience in general.The dynamics of ontogeny: A neuroconstructivist perspective on genes, brains, cognition and behavior - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The interfacing of language and music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognition & Attention - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectTrails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectGroups of participants built their understanding of concepts in LEGO bricks.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectThey were scanned with fMRI while they evaluated the products of their work.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectPhysical aspects of the models yielded neural activity in motor and fusiform regions.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectMeaning-related aspects yielded activity in social cognition-related areas and IFG.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectSelf-rated relatedness to fellow group members modulate activity in the insula.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectSymbolic artifacts present a challenge to theories of neurocognitive processing due to their hybrid nature: they are at the same time physical objects and vehicles of intangible social meanings. While their physical properties can be read of their perceptual appearance, the meaning of symbolic artifacts depends on the perceiver's interpretative attitude and embeddedness in cultural practices. In this study, participants built models of LEGO bricks to illustrate their understanding of abstract concepts. They were then scanned with fMRI while presented to photographs of their own and others' models. When participants attended to the meaning of the models in contrast to their bare physical properties, we observed activations in mPFC and TPJ, areas often associated with social cognition, and IFG, possibly related to semantics. When contrasting own and others' models, we also found activations in precuneus, an area associated with autobiographical memory and agency, while looking at one's own collective models yielded interaction effects in rostral ACC, right IFG and left Insula. Interestingly, variability in the insula was predicted by individual differences in participants' feeling of relatedness to their fellow group members during LEGO construction activity. Our findings support a view of symbolic artifacts as neuro-cognitive trails of human social interactions.Trails of meaning construction: Symbolic artifacts engage the social brain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mobile shopping cart abandonment: The roles of conflicts, ambivalence, and hesitation - ScienceDirectThough several industry reports have suggested that the rate of shopping cart abandonment is high in the mobile channel, the reasons for such abandonment remain relatively unexplored. Drawing on the cognition-affect-behavior (CAB) paradigm, this study aims to provide a conceptual framework explaining why consumers hesitate to use mobile channels for shopping and thus abandon their mobile shopping carts. Results from two studies show that mobile shopping cart abandonment is positively influenced by emotional ambivalence, a result of consumers' conflicting thoughts. More specifically, emotional ambivalence amplifies consumers' hesitation at the checkout stage, leading to cart abandonment. However, if hesitant consumers are satisfied with the choice process during shopping, they are less likely to give up their mobile shopping carts. Based on the findings, this mobile channel study provides practical and theoretical implications for marketers and e-cart abandonment researchers, respectively.Mobile shopping cart abandonment: The roles of conflicts, ambivalence, and hesitation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mobile shopping cart abandonment: The roles of conflicts, ambivalence, and hesitation - ScienceDirectGuei-Hua Huang is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Business Administration at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan.

The finding that our cognitive system maps pitch height onto an internal representation of space, which in turn affects motor performance even when this perceptual attribute is irrelevant to the task, extends previous studies on auditory perception and suggests an interesting analogy between music perception and mathematical cognition. Both the basic elements of mathematical cognition (i.e. numbers) and the basic elements of musical cognition (i.e. pitches), appear to be mapped onto a mental spatial representation in a way that affects motor performance.Spatial representation of pitch height: the SMARC effect - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectAmbiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectMethod for examining action attribution in ambiguous conditions.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectSelf-to-other continuum: manipulating the proportion of tones generated by self versus other.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectMisattribution peaked in ambiguous conditions biased towards other.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectHallucination proneness increased misattribution in ambiguous conditions.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectMusical experience reduced misattribution in ambiguous conditions.Ambiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectAmbiguity between self and other: Individual differences in action attribution - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectSystematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectMicroneurosurgical performance is affected by extrinsic and intrinsic factors.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectA total of 48 studies were systematically reviewed and graded.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectWe present 18 recommendations on 8 factors affecting microsurgical performance.Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectSystematic Review of Factors Influencing Surgical Performance: Practical Recommendations for Microsurgical Procedures in Neurosurgery - ScienceDirectA literature search of factors that may affect microsurgical performance was conducted using PubMed and Embase.

Cognitive processing of music is a useful tool for investigating human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Although general auditory processing and perception of musical sound are hampered in patients with MDD, whether the deficits in musical processing begin from pre-attentive stage is not well investigated yet. The present study aimed to investigate the MMN of musical sound in patients with MDD.Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectMMN responses to different musical features were compared in 20 patients with MDD and 20 age-matched healthy controls. The multi-feature paradigm was used to examine automatic change detection of six different musical sound features (pitch, timbre, location, intensity, slide, rhythm) in a complex musical context. Severity of depression and co-morbid anxiety were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA).Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectMMNs were obtained with all deviants. The timbre-MMN was significantly larger in MDD patients than in healthy controls, while the other deviants (pitch, location, intensity, slide and rhythm) elicited similar MMN across groups. For MDD patients, the amplitudes and latencies of MMNs did not correlate with severity of depression or co-morbid anxiety.Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectThe sample size in this study is relatively small.Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study - ScienceDirectPatients with MDD do not perform at the same level as controls in automatic change detection of timbre.

This study was designed to investigate whether the cognitive processing of threat in anxious individuals is dominated by abstract anticipatory memory, and whether this abstract memory mode is related to the incomplete activation of the fear network. Activation of the fear network was assessed during phobic exposure, as evidenced by the initial autonomic reaction. Spider phobics and controls were presented with a threatening imagery script. Half of them were exposed to a real-life spider. Spider phobics memorized relatively more abstract anticipatory descriptions than concrete sensory descriptions when compared with the control subjects. Only in phobic subjects, higher recognition of abstract anticipatory descriptions was inversely related to heart rate reactivity during exposure. A preferential memory mode for abstract information was related to an attenuated heart rate reactivity to threat in spider phobics. It is suggested that the preferential memory mode for abstract information may inhibit the activation of the subcortical affective memory system, which is crucial for the complete activation of the fear network. The absence of complete fear network activation may play a role in the persistence of anxiety disorders by hindering anxious individuals to learn that the stimuli they fear are not as dangerous as they assumed.High-Level Cognition in Phobics: Abstract Anticipatory Memory Is Associated with the Attenuation of Physiological Reactivity to Threat - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectA repeated listening procedure was designed to monitor changes in listener's appreciation of thematic categories in musical compositions. Subjects listened to a recorded musical composition. Passages selected from the composition were then played in pairs, and listeners rated their similarity. The similarity data were submitted to INDSCAL, a multidimensional scaling procedure, which located the passages in an n-dimensional space. This procedure was repeated in three separate sessions, so that changes in the perceived musical structure could be observed. In Study 1, subjects heard Liszt's Sonata in b, and target passages were Theme A, Theme B, and three variations of each theme. While extrathematic dimensions dominated early acquaintance, a theme dimension emerged in the second and third sessions. Musicians gave higher weight to the theme dimension than did nonmusicians, and theme was the only dimension for experts on this sonata. Musicians were also more accurate in a final classification test, but only after repeated listening. The effect of repeated exposure on transfer to new theme exemplars was considered in Study 2. It is hoped this work will foster more naturalistic approaches to musical cognition.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectThis paper is based on a dissertation presented to Princeton University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectThis research was supported, in part, by National Science Foundation Grant BNS 78-27943 to Princeton University, Sam Glucksberg, Principal Investigator, and was conducted while the author held a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.Emergence of thematic concepts in repeated listening to music - ScienceDirectThe author's address is Educational Testing Service, Research Division, Room 115, Rosedale Road, Princeton, NJ 08541.Computational geometric aspects of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading - ScienceDirectMany problems concerning the theory and technology of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading are fundamentally geometric in nature. It is therefore not surprising that the field of computational geometry can contribute greatly to these problems. The interaction between computational geometry and music yields new insights into the theories of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading, as well as new problems for research in several areas, ranging from mathematics and computer science to music theory, music perception, and musicology. Recent results on the geometric and computational aspects of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading are reviewed, connections to established areas of computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational biology, and crystallography are pointed out, and new open problems are proposed.Computational geometric aspects of rhythm, melody, and voice-leading - ScienceDirectResearch supported by NSERC.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectThis study integrates extant research relating to store-related cognitions, customer emotions (arousal and pleasure), satisfaction, and loyalty into one framework. The researchers administer a survey to 274 customers in four coffee shops of a major chain. Using these data, the researchers test the hypotheses and model with structural equation modelling. The findings suggest that (a) store-related cognitions differentially affect emotions and customer outcomes (satisfaction and loyalty) and (b) the two emotions of arousal and pleasure differentially mediate the relationships between store-related cognitions and customer outcomes.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Emotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectEmotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectEmotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectEmotions, store-environmental cues, store-choice criteria, and marketing outcomes - ScienceDirectImproving meal context in nursing homes.

Impact of four strategies on food intake and meal pleasure - ScienceDirectIn France, in most nursing homes, the composition of menus, the time and the place at which meals are served, the choice of one's place at the table are imposed on residents. Yet, the act of eating cannot be restricted to nutritional and sensory aspects alone. It also includes a psycho-affective dimension, which relates to the context in which the meal is served. We tested the impact of four contextual factors, considered individually, on food intake and meal pleasure in elderly people living in nursing homes: the way the main course was named on the menu, the size and the variety of portions of vegetables served to residents, the presence or not of condiments in the middle of the table and the presence or not of elements to modify the surroundings such as a decorative object on the table or background music. Twelve experimental meals were served to 42 nursing home residents. For each factor, we compared a control condition with two experimental conditions. Our study showed that changing a single contextual element of the meal in nursing homes could be sufficient to improve residents' satisfaction with their meals and increase the quantities of meat or vegetables consumed, as long as this factor had a direct impact on what was going to be consumed (increased variety on the plate, condiments on the table). Factors affecting the context of the meal (names of dishes, decor) proved to be ineffective. Given the budgetary constraints faced by nursing homes, this study proposes interesting and inexpensive ideas to increase satisfaction with meals and food intake in elderly people who are dependent on others for their meals.Improving meal context in nursing homes.

We hypothesized that indicators of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be present in the content of spoken language in older adults and be useful in distinguishing those with MCI from those who are cognitively intact. To test this hypothesis, we performed linguistic analyses of spoken words in participants with MCI and those with intact cognition participating in a clinical trial.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectData came from a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial to examine the effect of unstructured conversation on cognitive function among older adults with either normal cognition or MCI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01571427). Unstructured conversations (but with standardized preselected topics across subjects) were recorded between interviewers and interviewees during the intervention sessions of the trial from 14 MCI and 27 cognitively intact participants. From the transcription of interviewees recordings, we grouped spoken words using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a structured table of words, which categorizes 2500 words into 68 different word subcategories such as positive and negative words, fillers, and physical states. The number of words in each LIWC word subcategory constructed a vector of 68 dimensions representing the linguistic features of each subject. We used support vector machine and random forest classifiers to distinguish MCI from cognitively intact participants.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectMCI participants were distinguished from those with intact cognition using linguistic features obtained by LIWC with 84% classification accuracy which is well above chance 60%.Predicting mild cognitive impairment from spontaneous spoken utterances - ScienceDirectLinguistic analyses of spoken language may be a powerful tool in distinguishing MCI subjects from those with intact cognition.

These applications mimic the human brain functions, for example, recognize the speaker, sense the tone of the text. On this paper, we present the similarities of these with human cognitive functions. We establish a framework which gathers cognitive functions into nine intentional processes from the substructures of the human brain. The framework, underpins human cognitive functions, and categorizes cognitive computing functions into the functional hierarchy, through which we present the functional similarities between cognitive service and human cognitive functions to illustrate what kind of functions are cognitive in the computing. The results from the comparison of the functional hierarchy of cognitive functions are consistent with cognitive computing literature. Thus, the functional hierarchy allows us to find the type of cognition and reach the comparability between the applications.Cerebellar patients demonstrate preserved implicit knowledge of association strengths in musical sequences - ScienceDirectRecent findings suggest the involvement of the cerebellum in perceptual and cognitive tasks. Our study investigated whether cerebellar patients show musical priming based on implicit knowledge of tonal-harmonic music. Participants performed speeded phoneme identification on sung target chords, which were either related or less-related to prime contexts in terms of the tonal-harmonic system. As groups, both cerebellar patients and age-matched controls showed facilitated processing for related targets, as previously observed for healthy young adults. The outcome suggests that an intact cerebellum is not mandatory for accessing implicit knowledge stored in long-term memory and for its influence on perception. One patient showed facilitated processing for less-related targets (suggesting sensory priming). The findings suggest directions for future research on auditory perception in cerebellar patients to further our understanding of cerebellar functions.Cerebellar patients demonstrate preserved implicit knowledge of association strengths in musical sequences - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A computational framework for conceptual blending - ScienceDirectWe present a computational framework for conceptual blending, a concept invention method that is advocated in cognitive science as a fundamental and uniquely human engine for creative thinking. Our framework treats a crucial part of the blending process, namely the generalisation of input concepts, as a search problem that is solved by means of modern answer set programming methods to find commonalities among input concepts. We also address the problem of pruning the space of possible blends by introducing metrics that capture most of the so-called optimality principles, described in the cognitive science literature as guidelines to produce meaningful and serendipitous blends. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how our system invents novel concepts and theories in domains where creativity is crucial, namely mathematics and music.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectElectrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectRandomly assigned schoolchildren discriminated syntactic violations in complex music.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectAn EEG microstate reminiscent of the N400 occurred in response to the violations.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectViolation discrimination correlated to microstate strength and to working memory.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectUnderlying generators were localized in premotor and parietal brain areas.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectChildren's processing of syntax and meaning may coincide in musical contexts.Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectElectrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Silent disco: dancing in synchrony leads to elevated pain thresholds and social closeness - ScienceDirectMoving in synchrony leads to cooperative behavior and feelings of social closeness, and dance (involving synchronization to others and music) may cause social bonding, possibly as a consequence of released endorphins. This study uses an experimental paradigm to determine which aspects of synchrony in dance are associated with changes in pain threshold (a proxy for endorphin release) and social bonding between strangers. Those who danced in synchrony experienced elevated pain thresholds, whereas those in the partial and asynchrony conditions experienced no analgesic effects. Similarly, those in the synchrony condition reported being more socially bonded, although they did not perform more cooperatively in an economic game. This experiment suggests that dance encourages social bonding among co-actors by stimulating the production of endorphins, but may not make people more altruistic. We conclude that dance may have been an important human behavior evolved to encourage social closeness between strangers.Silent disco: dancing in synchrony leads to elevated pain thresholds and social closeness - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectTo determine whether rhythmic music and metronome cues alter spatiotemporal gait measures and gait variability in people with Alzheimer disease (AD).Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectA repeated-measures study requiring participants to walk under different cueing conditions.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectUniversity movement laboratory.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectEffect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectParticipants walked 4 times over an electronic walkway synchronizing to (1) rhythmic music and (2) a metronome set at individual mean baseline comfortable speed cadence.Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Cueing on Gait in People With Alzheimer Disease - ScienceDirectGait spatiotemporal measures and gait variability (coefficient of variation [CV]).

Pitch deafness provides an interesting opportunity to test for the independence of perception and production abilities in the speech domain. We tested eight amusics and eight matched controls for their ability to perceive pitch shifts in sentences and to imitate those same sentences. Congenital amusics were impaired in their ability to discriminate, but not to imitate different intonations in speech. These findings support the idea that, when we hear a vocally-imitatable sound, our brains encode it in two distinct ways- an abstract code, which allows us to identify it and compare it to other sounds, and a vocal-motor code, which allows us to imitate it.Amusics can imitate what they cannot discriminate - ScienceDirectAmusics can imitate what they cannot discriminate - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectEffects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectThe study evaluates the effects of cardiovascular, resistance and postural training on cognition.Effects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectThe interventions were highly standardized and monitored.Effects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectValidated neuropsychological tests were used to assure comparability of results.Effects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectThe procedures were designed in order to reduce environmental stimuli during intervention.Effects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectEffects of different types of physical activity on the cognitive functions and attention in older people: A randomized controlled study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.126 DOES TIMING TO MUSIC IMPROVE WALKING IN HEALTHY ELDERS AND THOSE WITH DEMENTIA?

In general, studies have shown that individuals with a history of depression endorse more dysfunctional attitudes following the induction of sad mood than never-depressed individuals. However, a recent study failed to find the expected differences between previously depressed and never-depressed participants. In the present study, two widely used mood-induction procedures were compared to investigate the possibility that different mood inductions lead to different outcomes. Forty-eight participants underwent two types of sad mood induction: focusing on a sad memory while listening to music and watching a movie fragment. Consistent with modern cognitive theory, mood-state dependency of dysfunctional cognitions (cognitive reactivity) was much higher in vulnerable individuals. This effect occurred during both mood inductions. However, the effects of the music induction were somewhat larger, and the correlation between change of mood and cognitive reactivity was significant in this condition only. Some other subtle differences between both procedures were found. In conclusion, although the effects of both inductions were largely similar, the musical induction is more sensitive, and is preferable for research into cognitive dysfunction in depression.Different types of experimentally induced sad mood? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Emotion and attention interactions in social cognition: Brain regions involved in processing anger prosody - ScienceDirectMultiple levels of processing are thought to be involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant events, with some processes being engaged relatively independently of attention, whereas other processes may depend on attention and current task goals or context. We conducted an event-related fMRI experiment to examine how processing angry voice prosody, an affectively and socially salient signal, is modulated by voluntary attention. To manipulate attention orthogonally to emotional prosody, we used a dichotic listening paradigm in which meaningless utterances, pronounced with either angry or neutral prosody, were presented simultaneously to both ears on each trial. In two successive blocks, participants selectively attended to either the left or right ear and performed a gender-decision on the voice heard on the target side. Our results revealed a functional dissociation between different brain areas. Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was heard from a to-be-attended or to-be-ignored voice, the orbitofrontal cortex and the cuneus in medial occipital cortex showed greater activation to the same emotional stimuli when the angry voice was to-be-attended rather than to-be-ignored. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed a strong correlation between orbitofrontal regions and sensitivity on a behavioral inhibition scale measuring proneness to anxiety reactions. Our results underscore the importance of emotion and attention interactions in social cognition by demonstrating that multiple levels of processing are involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant cues in voices, and by showing a modulation of some emotional responses by both the current task-demands and individual differences.Emotion and attention interactions in social cognition: Brain regions involved in processing anger prosody - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Emotion and attention interactions in social cognition: Brain regions involved in processing anger prosody - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.
