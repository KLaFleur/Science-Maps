We used national survey data from ambulatory settings to examine the depression treatment patterns and predictors among stroke survivors in the United States (US).Patterns and Predictors of Depression Treatment among Stroke Survivors with Depression in Ambulatory Settings in the United States - ScienceDirectPatterns and Predictors of Depression Treatment among Stroke Survivors with Depression in Ambulatory Settings in the United States - ScienceDirectThe overall depression treatment was observed in 47.32% of the study sample, mainly driven by antidepressant use alone. An overwhelming majority used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (77% of overall antidepressant use), and sertraline was the most prescribed antidepressant (30.5% of overall antidepressant use). Gender, race or ethnicity, region of residence, number of medications recorded at the sampled visit, and number of chronic conditions were significantly associated with depression treatment.Patterns and Predictors of Depression Treatment among Stroke Survivors with Depression in Ambulatory Settings in the United States - ScienceDirectAccording to this nationally representative sample, approximately 1 in 2 stroke survivors with depression received depression treatment in ambulatory care settings in the US.

However, gender symptom differences have been inconsistent, prompting this investigation of gender differences in secondary DSM symptom profiles in the context of bereavement status, age, and depression severity.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectIndividuals with symptoms of core depression (flat affect or anhedonia) were selected from a large survey of adults in the Alberta, Canada workforce. Analyses involved the comparison of gender profiles across the seven DSM-IV secondary depressive symptoms plus a MANOVA of sex, bereavement, and age, with secondary symptoms comprising the dependent variable.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectGender profiles were very similar, irrespective of depression severity or bereavement. Secondary symptoms were marginally more common among women and more frequent among bereaved young adults, but there was no evidence for a gender-related somatic factor.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectFirst, data were gathered only for persons in the workforce and thus may not be generalizable to, for example, stay-at-home parents or those with employment issues. Second, the focus here is restricted to DSM symptoms, leaving risk factors, social roles, and brain functioning for separate investigation. Third, inferences were drawn from associations between groups of persons, rather than between individuals, requiring caution when speculating about individual attributes.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectGender differences in depression represent a difference in amount, not kind, suggesting that the range of depressive experiences is similar for men and women. There was no gender difference ascribable to somatic depression.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectModeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectChildbirth is associated with increased risk for depression relative to times of non-childbearing.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectConsistent effect linking childbirth and depression over a 10-year period with six repeated measurements.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectClear association between depression level and times since delivery.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectThe literature on the relative risk for depression in the postpartum period has largely focused on state (or episodic) depression, and has not addressed trait depression (a woman's general tendency to experience depressed mood). The present study evaluates the association between childbirth and depression in the postpartum period, taking into account the role of stable differences in women's vulnerability for depression across a 10-year span.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectData from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (N = 4385) were used. The recency of childbirth was used as a predictor of state depression in two models: one that modeled stable depressive symptoms over time (a multi-state single-trait model; LST), and one that did not (an autoregressive cross-lagged model; ARM).Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectModeling trait depression, in addition to state depression, improved model fit and had the effect of increasing the magnitude of the association between childbirth and state depression in the postpartum period.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectThe secondary nature of the data limited the complexity of analyses (e.g., models with multivariate predictors were not possible), as the data were not collected with the present study in mind.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectThese findings may reflect the fact that some of the covariance between childbirth and episodic depression is obscured by the effect of trait depression, and it is not until trait depression is explicitly modeled that the magnitude of the relationship between childbirth and depression becomes clear.Modeling trait depression amplifies the effect of childbearing on postpartum depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectDepression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectMore than one in five older home health services users had current depression.Depression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectLess than 40% of older home health services users with depressive symptoms reported receiving depression treatment.Depression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectThe majority of older home health services users relied on antidepressants as the sole form of depression treatment.Depression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study is to provide a nationally representative estimate of the rates of depression and depression treatment, and to explore factors associated with receipt of depression treatment, among older home health services users.Depression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectDepression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectCurrent depression affected 23% of older home health services users. Less than 40% of those who screened positive for depression reported receiving depression treatment. Among those who received treatment, virtually all (99.8%) reported receiving antidepressants and only 9.5% reported receiving psychotherapy. Among older home health services users with current depression, older age and non-Hispanic black race were associated with lower odds of receiving depression treatment whereas having cognitive impairment was positively associated with receiving depression treatment.Depression prevalence and treatment among older home health services users in the United States - ScienceDirectDepression affects a substantial proportion of older home health services users and is undertreated. Home health services settings may be important platforms to improve depression care among older adults.

These approaches have been compared in the cancer setting, but the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative approaches have rarely been examined. The purpose of the current study was to examine the performance of four approaches to depression assessment among ambulatory cancer patients.Performance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectPerformance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectPerformance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectThe inclusive approach that retains use of somatic symptoms is appropriate when screening cancer patients for depression. The fact that somatic symptoms were more prevalent across approaches suggests that they may not inflate the prevalence of depression as much as some have feared. Rather, somatic items may explain variance in depressive symptoms beyond that explained by the presence of cancer and its treatment. Additionally, the Endicott items appeared useful for capturing depressive symptoms that are not included in the existing DSM criteria, and may have a place in clinical and research settings.Performance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Performance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectDeclarations of interest: none.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectStigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectThere is a significant correlation between depression and stigma.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectStigma is the most significant contributing factor to depression in patients with epilepsy.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectPrevention of epilepsy-associated stigma in patients with epilepsy is important for reducing comorbid depression rates.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectEpilepsy is a chronic disease with an increased risk of stigmatization due to psychosocial consequences of the seizures. Intuitively, one may well conclude that stigmatization would lead to depression in patients with epilepsy as well as in other patient groups with increased risk of stigmatization. Indeed, there are a few studies in support of this intuition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between level of stigmatization and the severity of the depressive symptoms in our patients with epilepsy.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectThis is a substudy of our main study, which aimed to develop a scale for the quantification of the stigma level in patients with epilepsy. The study included a total of 302 patients with epilepsy, who had at least a literacy level education and one-week-seizure-freedom. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to quantify depressive symptoms. The correlation between BDI scores and the Stigma Scale for Epilepsy-Self Report (SSE-SR) scores was evaluated. A regression analysis was done in order to parse out significant sociodemographic and clinical factors contributing to depressive symptoms. Statistical analyses were done using the Statistics Package for the Social Sciences software 24.0 package program.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectStigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectThis study shows that stigmatization of the patients with epilepsy leads to depression in those patients. Therefore, protection of the patients with epilepsy against stigmatization may also help to protect them from a concomitant disabling condition. On the other hand, detection for depressive symptoms in already stigmatized patients with epilepsy may unearth a treatable condition.Layered stigma?

Co-occurring depression and obesity in the public eye - ScienceDirectObesity and depression are common conditions in the general public and show a high level of co-morbidity. Both conditions are stigmatized, i.e., associated with negative attitudes and discrimination. Previous research shows that devalued conditions can overlap or combine to produce a layered stigma which is associated with more negative health outcomes than either single devalued condition alone. This study therefore set out to investigate the double stigma of obesity and depression.Layered stigma? Co-occurring depression and obesity in the public eye - ScienceDirectA telephone-based representative study of the German population was conducted. Vignettes describing women with obesity, depression or both conditions were presented, followed by a set of items on semantic differentials based on previous stigma research of depression (depression stigma DS) and obesity (Fat Phobia Scale FPS).

We compared levels of stigma experienced by individuals with depression and/or chronic pain, to contrast the perception of stigma experienced by the sufferers with that of individuals who have never experienced these conditions, and to determine whether depression is related to greater experience of stigma for chronic pain.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectFour groups of participants (N=236) took part in the study: depression only, chronic pain only, comorbid depression and chronic pain, and healthy controls. Participants underwent a clinical interview and completed a stigma measure that assessed general self-stigma, public stigma, treatment stigma, secrecy, and stigmatizing experiences.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectHealthy controls largely underestimated the stigma experienced by individuals with depression, but were not inaccurate in estimating stigma experienced by individuals with chronic pain. Further, individuals with chronic pain alone generally perceived less stigma for their condition than did those with depression alone. However, comorbid individuals perceived worse stigma of chronic pain compared to individuals with chronic pain alone, suggesting that depression may affect the stigma felt by sufferers of conditions other than depression.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectSocial desirability may have influenced stigma scores. Comparing several groups required adapting a standardized instrument.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectResults suggest that depression may play a role in the social experience of having a health condition, as well as indicate that the general public continues to fail to appreciate the negative social pressures experienced by individuals with mental health conditions.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectResting-state functional connectivity reflects correlations in the activity between brain areas, whereas effective connectivity between different brain areas measures directed influences of brain regions on each other. Using the latter approach, we compare effective connectivity results in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and control subjects.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectWe used a new approach to the measurement of effective connectivity, in which each brain area has a simple dynamical model, and known anatomical connectivity is used to provide constraints. This helps the approach to measure the effective connectivity between the 94 brain areas parceled in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL2) atlas, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, we show how the approach can be used to measure the differences in effective connectivity between different groups of individuals, using as an example effective connectivity in the healthy brain and in individuals with depression. The first brainwide resting-state effective-connectivity neuroimaging analysis of depression, with 350 healthy individuals and 336 patients with major depressive disorder, is described.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectKey findings are that the medial orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in reward and subjective pleasure, has reduced effective connectivity from temporal lobe input areas in depression; that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in nonreward, has increased activity (variance) in depression, with decreased effective connectivity to and from cortical areas contralateral to language-related areas; and that the hippocampus, implicated in memory, has increased activity (variance) in depression and increased effective connectivity from the temporal pole.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectMeasurements of effective connectivity made using the new method provide a new approach to causal mechanisms in the brain in depression.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectETR, WC, MG, JQ, and ZH contributed equally to this work.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectA cyber-ostracism experience scale for adolescents was developed.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism would increase the risk of depression.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism is a painful and distressful experience as ostracism in real life.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectOptimism optimisim could alleviate the detrimental effect of cyber-ostracism.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectParsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectDepression is a heterogeneous disorder with a variety of presenting symptoms.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectDepression rating scales may capture a number of constructs.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThis factor analysis studied rating scales often used in depression clinical trials.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThe identified constructs showed differential responses to ketamine.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThe constructs may help investigate the neurobiology of depression.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectParsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectParsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThe best solution, which exhibited excellent fit to the data, comprised eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia, and Amotivation.

Apathy, a common symptom of late-life depression, often leads to worse clinical outcomes. We examined if severity of apathy mediates cognitive difficulties in a cohort of older adults with major depression.Apathy Mediates Cognitive Difficulties in Geriatric Depression - ScienceDirectOne hundred thirty-eight older adults with depression (54.4% female; mean [SD] age: 69.7 [7.4] years; mean [SD] education:15.6 [2.7] years) were recruited to participate in a treatment study, and only baseline data were analyzed. All participants received a comprehensive evaluation of depression, apathy, and cognition. We examined whether apathy mediated the relationship between depression and cognition, focusing our attention on memory and cognitive control. We then explored whether the mediation effects differed across women and men.Apathy Mediates Cognitive Difficulties in Geriatric Depression - ScienceDirectIncreased apathy was significantly associated with worse depression and lower performance in the cognitive control domain but not in memory. Higher depressive scores were significantly associated with worse cognitive control but not memory. Mediation analyses revealed a significant indirect effect on cognitive control by depression through increased apathy scores with the mediator accounting for 21% of the total effect. Stratifying by sex, we found that women exhibited a significant indirect effect, with the mediator accounting for 47% of the total effect, whereas there was no mediation by apathy in men.Apathy Mediates Cognitive Difficulties in Geriatric Depression - ScienceDirectThe findings imply that increased apathy mediates the relationship between cognition and depression. The identification of mediating effects may inform future treatment strategies and preventive interventions that can focus on decreasing apathy to improve cognition in late-life depression.The prevalence of depression and the accuracy of depression screening tools in migraine patients - ScienceDirectMigraine and depression are common comorbid conditions.

Results of the ENFAMS survey - ScienceDirectWomen are disproportionately likely to suffer from depression. This is especially true for those who experience socioeconomic hardship, such as homelessness. In France, among homeless mothers many are migrant. However, it is not clear whether risk factors associated with depression are specific for this group or the same as in the general population. Our objective was to describe socio-demographic, relational, living and housing conditions and health factors associated with depression among homeless mothers.Factors associated with depression among homeless mothers. Results of the ENFAMS survey - ScienceDirectThe ENFAMS survey, conducted via face-to-face bilingual interviews with a representative sample of homeless families in the Paris region (January-May 2013, n = 733 mothers). Mothers reported their socio-demographic characteristics, housing conditions including residential mobility, as well as physical and mental health. Depression was ascertained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Factors associated with mother's depression were studied in weighted Poisson regression models with robust error variance.Factors associated with depression among homeless mothers. Results of the ENFAMS survey - ScienceDirectThe prevalence of depression among participating mothers was 28.8%.

Compared to the elderly control group, the depressed elderly group displayed poorer executive function, but this phenomenon was not found in the middle-aged group. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the factors of depression were NA and low PA for both the middle-aged and elderly depression groups. However, executive function including MSCT and VF were non-significant variables in regression analysis.Depression in Older Adults Among Community: The Role of Executive Function - ScienceDirectExecutive dysfunction in elderly people with depression may be associated with the age effect. As people with depression age, their executive dysfunction becomes more pronounced. An elevated NA and lack of PA can explain the severity of depression, but executive function cannot explain depression in either middle-aged or elderly people.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectEver since it was first defined, apathy has been described as a transnosographic entity, involved in many neuropsychiatric disorders not least depression. Owing to its impact on therapeutic outcomes and morbidity, this clinical dimension is of considerable interest in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the literature does not adequately emphasize the links between depression and apathy.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectIn a prospective open-cohort study of 70 depressed patients (from November 2014 to June 2015), we sought to compare the clinical and neuropsychological profiles of apathetic versus nonapathetic depressed patients.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectApathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectThe link between anhedonia and apathy highlights the difference between the consumption and programming of pleasure. The cognitive impairments of apathetic depressed patients may have an impact on their ability to allocate resources appropriately. The relationship between anxiety and apathy has been discussed in light of lack of insight. Taken together, results indicate that the apathy dimension subtends two clinical profiles of depression, which can be viewed as different pathophysiological clusters, as they probably affect two distinct networks. Further studies are needed to test this clinical hypothesis in the light of neurobiology.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectPTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectFlood-exposure is substantially associated with PTSD and depression symptoms.PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectFlood-exposure marginally influences support system by disrupting support networks.PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectSocial support system moderates the relationship between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression.PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectNo evidence was observed with regard to indirect effect of flood-exposure on PTSD via social support system.PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectThe family support system carried a significant proportion of variance in predicting depression.PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectPTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Resting-state quantitative EEG characteristics of insomniac patients with depression - ScienceDirectResting-state quantitative EEG characteristics of insomniac patients with depression - ScienceDirectPatients with chronic insomnia with comorbid depression showed increased amplitude of high beta and gamma bands in the middle anterior region compared to controls.Resting-state quantitative EEG characteristics of insomniac patients with depression - ScienceDirectThe present study provides a clue that allows comorbid insomnia with depression to be considered as a continuum of the CNS hyperarousal disorder.Resting-state quantitative EEG characteristics of insomniac patients with depression - ScienceDirectInsomnia is known to show hyperarousal in the central nervous system. However, depression that often coexists with insomnia exhibits hypo-activity in the frontal lobe, which is very different from insomnia. In the present study, we examined wake resting state EEG of insomniac patients with depression to investigate whether they could be conceptualized as spectrum of insomnia or significantly different from insomnia. We compared the absolute power values of EEG spectra of three groups: 15 insomniacs with comorbid depression (CD), age- and sex-matched 15 comorbid-free insomniacs (CFI), and 15 good sleep controls (GSC). As a result, CD and CFI showed no significant difference in the EEG power spectrum analysis. Compared with GSC, however, both CD and CFI groups showed increased high frequency EEG amplitude.

This increased prevalence is becoming a major problem due to the associated social and economic costs. This study investigates the effects of gambling on depression, using new data on England and Scotland, in a population-based sample. Using both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) scales of gambling addiction, we find evidence of a positive association between gambling behaviour and depression. Further, disaggregating the effects by gambling venue, our results suggest that online gambling poses a significant mental health risk compared to gambling in venues or outlets. Thus, we show that the high prevalence of gambling in Britain is associated with emotional and mental health costs.The impact of gambling on depression: New evidence from England and Scotland - ScienceDirectWe are grateful for comments from the Editor, Sushanta Mallick, and from two anonymous referees, which helped us improve the quality of our manuscripts.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectInvestigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectGenetic factors strongly influence iron measures in adolescents and adults.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectTransferrin saturation was phenotypically associated with depression in adolescents.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectWe find no evidence for a genetic relationship between iron and depression measures.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectInvestigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectDepression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectPerspective taking impacted both emotion explosiveness and accumulation.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectIts impact on explosiveness is similar for people high and low in depression severity.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectIts impact on accumulation is more outspoken for people high in depression severity.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectThinking about a negative event from a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective is associated with lower emotion intensity. However, it is unclear how self-distancing impacts emotion unfolding and whether individual differences in depression severity moderate this impact. We addressed this issue by examining the effect of self-distancing on emotion explosiveness (i.e., steepness of the emotion response at onset) and accumulation (i.e., intensification of the response after onset) in participants differing in levels of depression. Participants adopted a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective while reading and thinking about manipulated negative social feedback. Both explosiveness and accumulation decreased when participants adopted a self-distanced perspective. Moreover, the effect of perspective taking on accumulation was especially outspoken for people with high levels of depression severity.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectPrevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectWe explored to what extent depression prevalence varies when using different diagnostic criteria and rating scales in older adults.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectThe point prevalence of any depression was similar across all definitions except for ICD-10, showing much lower figures.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectDepression prevalence was lower in the dementia-free sample as compared to the total population.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectHaving poor physical function or not having a partner were independently associated with a higher prevalence of depression.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectDepression prevalence in older adults varies largely across studies, which probably reflects methodological rather than true differences.

The treatment of depression has been a challenge for a majority of patients and healthcare practitioners. The advent of pharmacogenomics (PGx) empowered the Food and Drug Administration to approve some antidepressant biomarkers for PGx model of treatment. The PGx testing identifies whether an individual is a poor metabolizer, ultra/rapid metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, or essential metabolizer of an antidepressants before prescription. This is a cutting edge treatment that eliminates trial and error. PGx testing has shown to precisely identify the effective medication and dose for a patient.A longitudinal study of perinatal depression among Chinese high-risk pregnant women - ScienceDirectInformation is needed on the prevalence of depression in Chinese women with medically defined complications across the perinatal period, as well as key risk factors to develop appropriate perinatal mental health services and ensure the services target those most in need.A longitudinal study of perinatal depression among Chinese high-risk pregnant women - ScienceDirectA longitudinal study of perinatal depression among Chinese high-risk pregnant women - ScienceDirectA longitudinal study of perinatal depression among Chinese high-risk pregnant women - ScienceDirectRepeated measures analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale scores at each time point between high-risk depressed and low-risk depressed groups.

A subgroup repeated the screening measures two weeks later. All participants also completed a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID). For the screening measures we computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value with SCID diagnoses as the reference standard and conducted receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses; we also assessed internal consistency and test-retest reliability.The validity and reliability of screening measures for depression and anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectOf 253 participants, the SCID classified 10.3% with major depression and 14.6% with generalized anxiety disorder. Among the depression measures, the PHQ-9 had the highest sensitivity (84%). Specificity was generally higher than sensitivity, and was highest for the HADS-D with a cut-point of 11 (95%). In ROC analyses the area under the curve (AUC) did not differ between depression measures. Among the anxiety measures, sensitivity was highest for the HADS-A with a cut-point of 8 (82%). Specificity ranged from 83% to 86% for all measures except the HADS-A with a cut-point of 8 (68%). The AUC did not differ between anxiety measures.The validity and reliability of screening measures for depression and anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectOverall, performance of the depression and anxiety screening measures was very similar, with reasonable psychometric properties for the MS population, suggesting that other factors such as accessibility and ease of use could guide the choice of measure in clinical practice.Fear of violent crime and anxiety/depression among adolescents - ScienceDirectFear of crime has been associated with mental health outcomes. Yet, causal relationships have not been established. We examined the relationship between fear and mental health while accounting for potential endogeneity. A sample of 2329 adolescents from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods dataset was analyzed to assess the effect of fear of neighborhood violent crime on anxiety/depression. Instrumental variable (IV) methods were used to address endogeneity. There is evidence that the estimated effect of fear on depressive symptoms does not suffer from endogeneity bias in single-equation models. Adolescents who were more fearful had higher anxiety/depression scores. In adjusted analyses, for each one unit increase in fear (in this case, a move from one level of fear to the next), anxiety/depression scores increased by 1.32 points. There is support for the hypothesis that fear of neighborhood violent crime caused an increase in anxiety/depression scores among adolescents. Many programs address exposure to violence as a potential cause of depression, however few address the fear of violent victimization as a cause. Interventions and services should address fear as a root cause of anxiety/depression among adolescents.Fear of violent crime and anxiety/depression among adolescents - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fear of violent crime and anxiety/depression among adolescents - ScienceDirectOn behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectAssociation between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectOdds of depression increase in subjects seropositive for herpes simplex-2.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectHigher IgG titers for cytomegalovirus were associated with depression.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectHepatitis A and B and herpes simplex-1 were not associated with depression.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectMood disorders are common mental illnesses. Among the factors associated with major depression are exposures to infectious diseases including hepatitis C, influenza, varicella-zoster, and herpes viruses. In this study, we sought to evaluate further associations between viral exposure and depression. From the US Center for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we obtained data about depression status, antidepressant use, exposure to hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus, and sociodemographic variables and evaluated associations between depression and viral exposure in adjusted multivariable models. Herpes simplex virus type 2 was associated with an increased risk of depression, whereas hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and herpes simplex virus type 1 were not. Higher cytomegalovirus antibody levels were associated with depression in subjects seropositive for cytomegalovirus. In conclusion, exposure to herpes simplex virus type 2 and possibly cytomegalovirus are associated with depression in an adult US sample.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectVariation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectSymptoms of depression and anxiety differ by menopausal status in midlife women.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectPerimenopause is associated with increased risk of greater symptoms of depression.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectPostmenopause is associated with increased risk of greater symptoms of anxiety.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectWomen without a history of symptoms may be at risk during perimenopause and postmenopause.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectTo examine the association between menopausal status and the risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety in a community-based sample of Australian midlife women.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectVariation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectSymptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Goldberg Depression Scale and Goldberg Anxiety Scale.

Animal models show that aversive caregiving alters effects of glucocorticoids (primarily corticosterone in rodents and cortisol in primates) on learning and neuroplasticity into adulthood.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectWe investigated whether history of childhood emotional abuse (EA) moderated effects of cortisol administration (CORT) versus placebo on emotional memory formation in depression. Participants included 75 unmedicated women with varying levels of depression severity and/or EA history. In a double-blind crossover investigation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure effects of CORT (vs. placebo) on neural function during emotional memory formation.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectCORT eliminated the well-known relationship between depression severity and negative memory bias, a finding explained by EA severity. For women with a history of severe EA, CORT reduced depression-related negative memory bias and normalized recall for pleasant stimuli. EA severity also moderated CORT effects on neural function: in women with history of severe EA, CORT increased activation in the supplementary motor area during viewing of unpleasant relative to pleasant pictures. Additionally, supplementary motor area activation predicted reduced negative bias for pictures encoded during CORT.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectThese results suggest that increasing cortisol signaling may be neurocognitively beneficial in depressed women with a history of maltreatment. The findings corroborate prior research suggesting that presence or absence of adverse caregiving is etiologically important in depression. These findings suggest potential neurocognitive mechanisms of therapeutics targeting cortisol signaling, which show promise in treating affective disorders.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectHCA and CPF contributed equally to this work.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectMethods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectEEG based measures for detection of depression.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectMethods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectNo single superior measure to detect depression.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectHigh depression detection sensitivity by combining measures from single EEG channel.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectDepressive disorder is one of the leading causes of burden of disease today and it is presumed to take the first place in the world in 2030.

The ability to switch neural resources between default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) has been proposed as a key mechanism for adaptive mood regulation. The anterior insula is implicated in the modulation of functional network switching. Differential connectivity between anterior insula and functional networks may provide insights into pathophysiological differences between bipolar and unipolar mood disorders, with implications for diagnosis and treatment.Functional connectivity between anterior insula and key nodes of frontoparietal executive control and salience networks distinguish bipolar depression from unipolar depression and healthy controls - ScienceDirectResting state fMRI data were collected from 98 subjects (35 unipolar, 24 bipolar and 39 healthy controls). Pearson correlations were computed between bilateral insula seed regions and a priori defined target regions from the DMN, SN, and ECN.

Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but little is known about its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectThe sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectIrritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%.

However, effective delivery of GCBT for depression in primary care settings is often impeded by high dropout rates and poor homework adherence. In this study, we describe the structure, processes, and outcomes (including attendance, homework completion, and symptom measures) of GCBT for Spanish-speaking Latino patients with depression in an urban public sector primary care setting. For this study, 96 Latino patients in a primary care clinic participated in at least 1 session of GCBT. Although depressive symptoms among these patients, as measured by the PHQ-9, significantly decreased during treatment, attendance and homework completion were limited. Even with a strategy in place to allow patients to continue in treatment after missing several sessions, 23% of patients dropped out of therapy following their initial session, and approximately half of all patients completed less than 50% (or 8) therapy sessions. Homework was only completed 23% of the time it was checked. Greater session attendance prospectively predicted lower depressive symptoms over time. We discuss potential strategies to increase engagement, treatment effects, and symptom reduction for depression in primary care settings.Implementing Group CBT for Depression Among Latinos in a Primary Care Clinic - ScienceDirectA longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectA longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking and perfectionism are associated with depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirect71 women were assessed in their third trimester of pregnancy and post birth.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectAntenatal perfectionism lead to antenatal repetitive negative thinking.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking was associated with antenatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectFuture research should examine treatments for these processes in perinatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking and perfectionism have both been proposed as processes that are related to depressive symptoms. The purpose of this study was to investigate concurrent and prospective relationships between antenatal and postnatal depression, perfectionism, and repetitive negative thinking. A longitudinal design was used and 71 women were followed from their third trimester of pregnancy to six weeks post birth. A structural equation model was tested with antenatal perfectionism predicting antenatal repetitive negative thinking, perfectionism predicting postnatal depression, and antenatal repetitive negative thinking predicting antenatal and postnatal depression. The final model provided an adequate fit to the data but the pathway from antenatal repetitive negative thinking to postnatal depression was not significant. The findings provide support for the role of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in the onset and maintenance of perinatal symptoms of depression. It is suggested that future research investigates the efficacy of targeting repetitive negative thinking and perfectionism in pregnancy to examine if this can reduce perinatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAssociation between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectThis study included almost 12900 type 2 diabetes patients with or without depression.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAt the end of follow-up, 67.5% of depression cases were persistent with antidiabetics.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAt the end of follow-up, 69.7% of controls were persistent with antidiabetics.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectDepression had no significant impact on persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectThe goal of the present work was to study the impact of depression on persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients followed in general practices in Germany. We included T2DM patients who were treated with oral antihyperglycemic drugs and had an initial diagnosis of depression from 1262 general practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2015. T2DM controls without depression were included and matched (1:1) to T2DM cases with depression based on age, sex, physician, and initial antihyperglycemic therapy, using a propensity score method. Persistence was estimated as therapy duration without treatment disruption, which was defined as at least 3 months without oral antihyperglycemic drugs. This study included 6449 T2DM patients with depression and 6449 T2DM patients without depression. After 12 months of follow-up, 67.5% of cases with depression and 69.7% of controls without depression were found to be persistent with oral antihyperglycemic drugs (p = 0.627). Depression had no significant impact on persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs in the entire population (HR = 1.03) or in the different subgroups (HRs ranging from 1.00 to 1.06). Depression was not significantly associated with persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs in Germany.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their association to postpartum depression - ScienceDirectAdverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their association to postpartum depression - ScienceDirectPhysical and/or sexual ACEs were reported by 39.4% and physical and/or sexual intimate IPV in the index pregnancy was 18.8%.Adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their association to postpartum depression - ScienceDirectSymptoms of postpartum depression were reported by 13.6% (68) of women at one month to nine months postpartum.Adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their association to postpartum depression - ScienceDirectSexual and/or physical ACEs and physical and/or sexual IPV showed a significant association with symptoms of postpartum depression.Adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their association to postpartum depression - ScienceDirectThe presence of any ACE and any IPV during pregnancy, had a greater effect on postpartum depression.Adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their association to postpartum depression - ScienceDirectAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are recognized global health problems.

However, little is known about how the stigma of depression manifests among Arab adolescents, which makes it difficult to design, implement, and disseminate effective anti-stigma interventions for this vulnerable population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine levels of depression stigma among Arab adolescents. The specific aims were to (1) describe the severity of personal and perceived depression stigma among Arab adolescents and its relationship to severity of depression, and (2) determine characteristics associated with severity of depression stigma among Arab adolescents.Personal and Perceived Depression Stigma among Arab Adolescents: Associations with Depression Severity and Personal Characteristics - ScienceDirectPersonal and Perceived Depression Stigma among Arab Adolescents: Associations with Depression Severity and Personal Characteristics - ScienceDirectThe majority of the adolescents (88%) reported scores indicating moderate to high depression stigma. Adolescents reported higher rates of perceived stigma than personal stigma. Depression stigma was not significantly associated with severity of depression, but with adolescent's sex, age, region of residence, parents' education, and history of mental health problem.Personal and Perceived Depression Stigma among Arab Adolescents: Associations with Depression Severity and Personal Characteristics - ScienceDirectThis is the first Arab study to isolate the influence of adolescent depression and personal characteristics on personal and perceived depression stigmas, and highlight the presence of these distinctions early in adolescence. Such distinction can inform the design and implementation of policies and interventions to reduce both personal and perceived stigma.

Maternal depression was measured at six time points from the first clinic visit of an index pregnancy to 27 years after birth. A semi-parametric mixture model was used to identify three symptom trajectories of low-stable, moderate-stable and moderate-rising depression. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to determine whether a number of commonly occurring birth outcomes predicted moderate-stable and/or moderate-rising depression trajectories over the subsequent 27 years. Sociodemographic and behavioural factors were used to adjust for possible confounding.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectAfter adjustment for potential confounders, none of the adverse birth outcomes predicted subsequent maternal depression trajectories. Teenage pregnancy, not completing high school, low family income, obesity, poorer quality partnership and not exercising, measured at women's first clinic visit, and small social networks at three to five days after birth, were significantly associated with women's moderate-rising depressive-symptoms trajectory over 27 years.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectCommonly occurring adverse birth outcomes do not predict long-term depressive trajectories.

Next, we found that PPM1F messenger RNA levels in human blood were downregulated in cases with symptoms of comorbid PTSD and depression and consistently in cases with anxiety symptoms in a separate human dataset. Furthermore, we showed that a genetic variant of PPM1F, rs17759843, was associated with comorbid PTSD and depression and with PPM1F expression in both human brain and blood. Given prior reported mechanistic links between PPM1F and CAMK2 (CAMKII), we examined blood messenger RNA level of CAMK2G in humans and found it to be lower in cases with comorbid PTSD and depression. We also found that PPM1F protein levels and colocalization with CAMK2G were altered in amygdala and mPFC of male mice. Additionally, we found that a systemic dose of corticosterone blocked the depressive-like phenotype elicited by stress in female mice. Lastly, corticosterone rescued the anxiety-like phenotype and messenger RNA levels of Ppm1f in amygdala and mPFC in male mice and in mPFC of female mice.Expression of the PPM1F Gene Is Regulated by Stress and Associated With Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectTaken together, our data suggest a mechanistic pathway involving PPM1F and CAMK2G in stress- and trauma-related manifestation of anxiety and depression across species.Expression of the PPM1F Gene Is Regulated by Stress and Associated With Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectTo examine the relation between depressive symptoms and outcome of carpal tunnel release (CTR).Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectProspective study in a general hospital with data collection at baseline and 3 and 12 months after CTR. We quantified depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and performed multivariable analyses on 2 outcome measures: (1) carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms (Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire [BCTQ]) and (2) palmar pain, focusing on preoperative CES-D and BCTQ score, sex, age, alcohol use, diabetes, and severity of nerve conduction abnormalities.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectWe included 227 patients. Before surgery, patients with depression had a higher BCTQ score than patients without depression. After 1 year, depressed patients had a higher BCTQ score and more palmar pain. The CES-D decreased by a median of 2 points from baseline to 1 year. This correlated with the decrease in BCTQ score. Multivariable analyses showed that preoperative depression had a small but statistically significant influence on palmar pain, but not on postoperative BCTQ score.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectDepression is not an independent predictor of residual CTS symptoms 1 year after CTR. Depressive symptoms in patients with CTS decrease after CTR, along with a decrease in CTS symptoms. The nature of this relationship is unknown. Patients with CTS and depression may expect a somewhat higher degree of palmar pain after CTR, the clinical relevance of which is small.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectPrognostic II.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectNo benefits in any form have been received or will be received related directly or indirectly to the subject of this article.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectSocial capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectA nationally representative sample of the Korean population used in the study.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirect5969 people aged 60 years or older were included as the sample.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectCognitive social capital included interpersonal trust and reciprocity.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectSignificant association of cognitive social capital with depression in the elderly.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectReciprocity level mediated the association between income level and depression.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectA growing body of evidence has suggested that social capital is an upstream social determinant of mental health. We investigated the association of cognitive social capital, including interpersonal trust and reciprocity, with depressive symptoms in the elderly. We also explored the mediating role of cognitive social capital in the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and depressive symptoms and the moderating effect of SES on the relationship between social capital and depressive symptoms. Data from the 2012 Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) was analyzed for 5969 participants aged 60 years or older. Cognitive components of social capital, including interpersonal trust and reciprocity, were evaluated using single-item questionnaires. Socioeconomic and health-related characteristics were investigated and depressive symptoms were evaluated by an 11-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Low interpersonal trust and reciprocity levels were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly. Reciprocity level mediated the association between household income level and depressive symptoms. We did not observe any significant moderating effect of SES on the association between cognitive social capital and depressive symptoms. A significant association between cognitive social capital and depressive symptoms in Korean elderly was found. We elucidated how SES interacted with depressive symptoms through the mediation pathway of cognitive social capital using a representative sample of the Korean elderly population.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sticking with it?

Yet, previous studies seem to overlook the influence of personality on behavior. Particularly, neuroticism may moderate the effect of depression on the way people behave. As one of the Big-Five factors of personality, neuroticism refers to a trait of one's capability to control emotional distress. Based on behavioral data from 393 Facebook users, current research demonstrates the interaction between depression and personality. Users engaged in activities at different levels of activities corresponding to their depression levels. Further, the effect of depression on social networking was regulated by personality: once neuroticism exceeded certain points, an increase in depression led to a decrease in social networking activities.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectSpecificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional and memory bias do not overlap in explaining depressive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably related to depressive symptoms, but not to anxiety symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably related to mood and cognitive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional bias is not related to depressive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional and memory biases are viewed as crucial cognitive processes underlying symptoms of depression. However, it is still unclear whether these two biases are uniquely related to depression or whether they show substantial overlap.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectWe investigated the degree of specificity and overlap of attentional and memory biases for depressotypic stimuli in relation to depression and anxiety by means of meta-analytic commonality analysis. By including four published studies, we considered a pool of 463 healthy and subclinically depressed individuals, different experimental paradigms, and different psychological measures.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably and strongly related to depression and, specifically, to symptoms of negative mood, worthlessness, feelings of failure, and pessimism.

However, gender symptom differences have been inconsistent, prompting this investigation of gender differences in secondary DSM symptom profiles in the context of bereavement status, age, and depression severity.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectIndividuals with symptoms of core depression (flat affect or anhedonia) were selected from a large survey of adults in the Alberta, Canada workforce. Analyses involved the comparison of gender profiles across the seven DSM-IV secondary depressive symptoms plus a MANOVA of sex, bereavement, and age, with secondary symptoms comprising the dependent variable.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectGender profiles were very similar, irrespective of depression severity or bereavement. Secondary symptoms were marginally more common among women and more frequent among bereaved young adults, but there was no evidence for a gender-related somatic factor.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectFirst, data were gathered only for persons in the workforce and thus may not be generalizable to, for example, stay-at-home parents or those with employment issues. Second, the focus here is restricted to DSM symptoms, leaving risk factors, social roles, and brain functioning for separate investigation. Third, inferences were drawn from associations between groups of persons, rather than between individuals, requiring caution when speculating about individual attributes.Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement - ScienceDirectGender differences in depression represent a difference in amount, not kind, suggesting that the range of depressive experiences is similar for men and women.

These approaches have been compared in the cancer setting, but the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative approaches have rarely been examined. The purpose of the current study was to examine the performance of four approaches to depression assessment among ambulatory cancer patients.Performance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectPerformance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectPerformance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectThe inclusive approach that retains use of somatic symptoms is appropriate when screening cancer patients for depression. The fact that somatic symptoms were more prevalent across approaches suggests that they may not inflate the prevalence of depression as much as some have feared. Rather, somatic items may explain variance in depressive symptoms beyond that explained by the presence of cancer and its treatment. Additionally, the Endicott items appeared useful for capturing depressive symptoms that are not included in the existing DSM criteria, and may have a place in clinical and research settings.Performance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Performance of four diagnostic approaches to depression in adults with cancer - ScienceDirectDeclarations of interest: none.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectStigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectThere is a significant correlation between depression and stigma.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectStigma is the most significant contributing factor to depression in patients with epilepsy.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectPrevention of epilepsy-associated stigma in patients with epilepsy is important for reducing comorbid depression rates.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectEpilepsy is a chronic disease with an increased risk of stigmatization due to psychosocial consequences of the seizures. Intuitively, one may well conclude that stigmatization would lead to depression in patients with epilepsy as well as in other patient groups with increased risk of stigmatization. Indeed, there are a few studies in support of this intuition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between level of stigmatization and the severity of the depressive symptoms in our patients with epilepsy.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectThis is a substudy of our main study, which aimed to develop a scale for the quantification of the stigma level in patients with epilepsy. The study included a total of 302 patients with epilepsy, who had at least a literacy level education and one-week-seizure-freedom. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to quantify depressive symptoms. The correlation between BDI scores and the Stigma Scale for Epilepsy-Self Report (SSE-SR) scores was evaluated. A regression analysis was done in order to parse out significant sociodemographic and clinical factors contributing to depressive symptoms. Statistical analyses were done using the Statistics Package for the Social Sciences software 24.0 package program.Stigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectStigma accounts for depression in patients with epilepsy - ScienceDirectThis study shows that stigmatization of the patients with epilepsy leads to depression in those patients. Therefore, protection of the patients with epilepsy against stigmatization may also help to protect them from a concomitant disabling condition. On the other hand, detection for depressive symptoms in already stigmatized patients with epilepsy may unearth a treatable condition.Layered stigma?

Co-occurring depression and obesity in the public eye - ScienceDirectObesity and depression are common conditions in the general public and show a high level of co-morbidity. Both conditions are stigmatized, i.e., associated with negative attitudes and discrimination. Previous research shows that devalued conditions can overlap or combine to produce a layered stigma which is associated with more negative health outcomes than either single devalued condition alone. This study therefore set out to investigate the double stigma of obesity and depression.Layered stigma? Co-occurring depression and obesity in the public eye - ScienceDirectA telephone-based representative study of the German population was conducted. Vignettes describing women with obesity, depression or both conditions were presented, followed by a set of items on semantic differentials based on previous stigma research of depression (depression stigma DS) and obesity (Fat Phobia Scale FPS).

We compared levels of stigma experienced by individuals with depression and/or chronic pain, to contrast the perception of stigma experienced by the sufferers with that of individuals who have never experienced these conditions, and to determine whether depression is related to greater experience of stigma for chronic pain.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectFour groups of participants (N=236) took part in the study: depression only, chronic pain only, comorbid depression and chronic pain, and healthy controls. Participants underwent a clinical interview and completed a stigma measure that assessed general self-stigma, public stigma, treatment stigma, secrecy, and stigmatizing experiences.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectHealthy controls largely underestimated the stigma experienced by individuals with depression, but were not inaccurate in estimating stigma experienced by individuals with chronic pain. Further, individuals with chronic pain alone generally perceived less stigma for their condition than did those with depression alone. However, comorbid individuals perceived worse stigma of chronic pain compared to individuals with chronic pain alone, suggesting that depression may affect the stigma felt by sufferers of conditions other than depression.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectSocial desirability may have influenced stigma scores. Comparing several groups required adapting a standardized instrument.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectResults suggest that depression may play a role in the social experience of having a health condition, as well as indicate that the general public continues to fail to appreciate the negative social pressures experienced by individuals with mental health conditions.Depression increases subjective stigma of chronic pain - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectResting-state functional connectivity reflects correlations in the activity between brain areas, whereas effective connectivity between different brain areas measures directed influences of brain regions on each other. Using the latter approach, we compare effective connectivity results in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and control subjects.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectWe used a new approach to the measurement of effective connectivity, in which each brain area has a simple dynamical model, and known anatomical connectivity is used to provide constraints. This helps the approach to measure the effective connectivity between the 94 brain areas parceled in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL2) atlas, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, we show how the approach can be used to measure the differences in effective connectivity between different groups of individuals, using as an example effective connectivity in the healthy brain and in individuals with depression. The first brainwide resting-state effective-connectivity neuroimaging analysis of depression, with 350 healthy individuals and 336 patients with major depressive disorder, is described.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectKey findings are that the medial orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in reward and subjective pleasure, has reduced effective connectivity from temporal lobe input areas in depression; that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in nonreward, has increased activity (variance) in depression, with decreased effective connectivity to and from cortical areas contralateral to language-related areas; and that the hippocampus, implicated in memory, has increased activity (variance) in depression and increased effective connectivity from the temporal pole.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectMeasurements of effective connectivity made using the new method provide a new approach to causal mechanisms in the brain in depression.Effective Connectivity in Depression - ScienceDirectETR, WC, MG, JQ, and ZH contributed equally to this work.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectA cyber-ostracism experience scale for adolescents was developed.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism would increase the risk of depression.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism is a painful and distressful experience as ostracism in real life.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectOptimism optimisim could alleviate the detrimental effect of cyber-ostracism.Cyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCyber-ostracism and its relation to depression among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of optimism - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectParsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectDepression is a heterogeneous disorder with a variety of presenting symptoms.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectDepression rating scales may capture a number of constructs.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThis factor analysis studied rating scales often used in depression clinical trials.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThe identified constructs showed differential responses to ketamine.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThe constructs may help investigate the neurobiology of depression.Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectParsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectParsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales - ScienceDirectThe best solution, which exhibited excellent fit to the data, comprised eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia, and Amotivation.

Apathy, a common symptom of late-life depression, often leads to worse clinical outcomes. We examined if severity of apathy mediates cognitive difficulties in a cohort of older adults with major depression.Apathy Mediates Cognitive Difficulties in Geriatric Depression - ScienceDirectOne hundred thirty-eight older adults with depression (54.4% female; mean [SD] age: 69.7 [7.4] years; mean [SD] education:15.6 [2.7] years) were recruited to participate in a treatment study, and only baseline data were analyzed. All participants received a comprehensive evaluation of depression, apathy, and cognition. We examined whether apathy mediated the relationship between depression and cognition, focusing our attention on memory and cognitive control. We then explored whether the mediation effects differed across women and men.Apathy Mediates Cognitive Difficulties in Geriatric Depression - ScienceDirectIncreased apathy was significantly associated with worse depression and lower performance in the cognitive control domain but not in memory. Higher depressive scores were significantly associated with worse cognitive control but not memory. Mediation analyses revealed a significant indirect effect on cognitive control by depression through increased apathy scores with the mediator accounting for 21% of the total effect. Stratifying by sex, we found that women exhibited a significant indirect effect, with the mediator accounting for 47% of the total effect, whereas there was no mediation by apathy in men.Apathy Mediates Cognitive Difficulties in Geriatric Depression - ScienceDirectThe findings imply that increased apathy mediates the relationship between cognition and depression. The identification of mediating effects may inform future treatment strategies and preventive interventions that can focus on decreasing apathy to improve cognition in late-life depression.The prevalence of depression and the accuracy of depression screening tools in migraine patients - ScienceDirectMigraine and depression are common comorbid conditions.

Results of the ENFAMS survey - ScienceDirectWomen are disproportionately likely to suffer from depression. This is especially true for those who experience socioeconomic hardship, such as homelessness. In France, among homeless mothers many are migrant. However, it is not clear whether risk factors associated with depression are specific for this group or the same as in the general population. Our objective was to describe socio-demographic, relational, living and housing conditions and health factors associated with depression among homeless mothers.Factors associated with depression among homeless mothers. Results of the ENFAMS survey - ScienceDirectThe ENFAMS survey, conducted via face-to-face bilingual interviews with a representative sample of homeless families in the Paris region (January-May 2013, n = 733 mothers). Mothers reported their socio-demographic characteristics, housing conditions including residential mobility, as well as physical and mental health. Depression was ascertained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Factors associated with mother's depression were studied in weighted Poisson regression models with robust error variance.Factors associated with depression among homeless mothers. Results of the ENFAMS survey - ScienceDirectThe prevalence of depression among participating mothers was 28.8%. In multivariate analyses, depression was associated with fluency in French (PR = 1.88 95% CI 1.40; 2.51), suicide risk (PR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.82; 2.82), post-traumatic stress disorder (PR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.50; 2.60), and unmet health needs (PR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.09; 2.57).Factors associated with depression among homeless mothers.

Compared to the elderly control group, the depressed elderly group displayed poorer executive function, but this phenomenon was not found in the middle-aged group. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the factors of depression were NA and low PA for both the middle-aged and elderly depression groups. However, executive function including MSCT and VF were non-significant variables in regression analysis.Depression in Older Adults Among Community: The Role of Executive Function - ScienceDirectExecutive dysfunction in elderly people with depression may be associated with the age effect. As people with depression age, their executive dysfunction becomes more pronounced. An elevated NA and lack of PA can explain the severity of depression, but executive function cannot explain depression in either middle-aged or elderly people.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectEver since it was first defined, apathy has been described as a transnosographic entity, involved in many neuropsychiatric disorders not least depression. Owing to its impact on therapeutic outcomes and morbidity, this clinical dimension is of considerable interest in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the literature does not adequately emphasize the links between depression and apathy.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectIn a prospective open-cohort study of 70 depressed patients (from November 2014 to June 2015), we sought to compare the clinical and neuropsychological profiles of apathetic versus nonapathetic depressed patients.Apathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectApathy and depression: Which clinical specificities? - ScienceDirectThe link between anhedonia and apathy highlights the difference between the consumption and programming of pleasure. The cognitive impairments of apathetic depressed patients may have an impact on their ability to allocate resources appropriately. The relationship between anxiety and apathy has been discussed in light of lack of insight. Taken together, results indicate that the apathy dimension subtends two clinical profiles of depression, which can be viewed as different pathophysiological clusters, as they probably affect two distinct networks.

However, depression that often coexists with insomnia exhibits hypo-activity in the frontal lobe, which is very different from insomnia. In the present study, we examined wake resting state EEG of insomniac patients with depression to investigate whether they could be conceptualized as spectrum of insomnia or significantly different from insomnia. We compared the absolute power values of EEG spectra of three groups: 15 insomniacs with comorbid depression (CD), age- and sex-matched 15 comorbid-free insomniacs (CFI), and 15 good sleep controls (GSC). As a result, CD and CFI showed no significant difference in the EEG power spectrum analysis. Compared with GSC, however, both CD and CFI groups showed increased high frequency EEG amplitude. From these results, we have confirmed that CD shows cortical hyperarousal similar to insomnia in the daytime resting state. In conclusion, it would be reasonable to understood insomniac patients experiencing depression as a continuum of insomnia patients.Resting-state quantitative EEG characteristics of insomniac patients with depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Resting-state quantitative EEG characteristics of insomniac patients with depression - ScienceDirectResting-state EEG in insomniacs with depressionRelations Between Depression Level and Conflict Resolution Styles, Marital Adjustments of Patients With Major Depression and Their Spouses - ScienceDirectRelations Between Depression Level and Conflict Resolution Styles, Marital Adjustments of Patients With Major Depression and Their Spouses - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Association of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectAssociation of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectStudies about the effects of trace elements on depression are limited or inconsistent.Association of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectZinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes may be inversely associated with depression.Association of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectL-shaped associations were found using restricted cubic spline models.Association of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectThe aim of present study was to examine the associations of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes from diet and supplements with depression.Association of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectAssociation of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectAssociation of total zinc, iron, copper and selenium intakes with depression in the US adults - ScienceDirectThis was a cross-sectional study, limiting causal inferences.

This increased prevalence is becoming a major problem due to the associated social and economic costs. This study investigates the effects of gambling on depression, using new data on England and Scotland, in a population-based sample. Using both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) scales of gambling addiction, we find evidence of a positive association between gambling behaviour and depression. Further, disaggregating the effects by gambling venue, our results suggest that online gambling poses a significant mental health risk compared to gambling in venues or outlets. Thus, we show that the high prevalence of gambling in Britain is associated with emotional and mental health costs.The impact of gambling on depression: New evidence from England and Scotland - ScienceDirectWe are grateful for comments from the Editor, Sushanta Mallick, and from two anonymous referees, which helped us improve the quality of our manuscripts.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectInvestigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectGenetic factors strongly influence iron measures in adolescents and adults.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectTransferrin saturation was phenotypically associated with depression in adolescents.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectWe find no evidence for a genetic relationship between iron and depression measures.Investigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectInvestigating the relationship between iron and depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectDepression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectPerspective taking impacted both emotion explosiveness and accumulation.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectIts impact on explosiveness is similar for people high and low in depression severity.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectIts impact on accumulation is more outspoken for people high in depression severity.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectThinking about a negative event from a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective is associated with lower emotion intensity. However, it is unclear how self-distancing impacts emotion unfolding and whether individual differences in depression severity moderate this impact. We addressed this issue by examining the effect of self-distancing on emotion explosiveness (i.e., steepness of the emotion response at onset) and accumulation (i.e., intensification of the response after onset) in participants differing in levels of depression. Participants adopted a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective while reading and thinking about manipulated negative social feedback. Both explosiveness and accumulation decreased when participants adopted a self-distanced perspective. Moreover, the effect of perspective taking on accumulation was especially outspoken for people with high levels of depression severity.Depression severity moderates the relation between self-distancing and features of emotion unfolding - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectPrevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectWe explored to what extent depression prevalence varies when using different diagnostic criteria and rating scales in older adults.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectThe point prevalence of any depression was similar across all definitions except for ICD-10, showing much lower figures.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectDepression prevalence was lower in the dementia-free sample as compared to the total population.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectHaving poor physical function or not having a partner were independently associated with a higher prevalence of depression.Prevalence of depression: Comparisons of different depression definitions in population-based samples of older adults - ScienceDirectDepression prevalence in older adults varies largely across studies, which probably reflects methodological rather than true differences.

Norethindrone-only pill use is associated with a decreased risk of both issues.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectAlcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectWe examine the relationship between alcohol and depression.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectWe use information on self-assessed depression.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectDrinking behaviour is captured using consumption intensity and alcohol dependence.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectWe find that drinking alcohol promotes depression.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectIntensity of alcohol use, rather than consumption frequency, promotes depression.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectA relatively large body of literature examines the association between depression and alcohol consumption, with evidence suggesting a bidirectional causal relationship. However, the endogeneity arising from this reverse causation has not been addressed in the literature.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectUsing data on 5828 respondents from the Health Survey for England (HSE), this study revisits the relationship between alcohol and depression and addresses the endogenous nature of this relationship. We use information on self-assessed depression, and control for endogeneity using the Lewbel two-staged least square (2SLS) estimation technique.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectWe find that drinking alcohol promotes depression, and this is consistent across several measures of drinking behaviour including the amount of alcohol consumed, consumption intensity, alcohol dependence and risk of dependence.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectWhile drinking may be generally accepted and in the case of England, part of the culture, this has costs in terms of both physical and mental health that ought not to be ignored. While public policy has predominantly focused on the physical aspects of excessive alcohol consumption it is possible that these policies will also have a direct positive spillover in terms of the mental health costs, through the impact of lower alcohol consumption on quality of life and wellbeing.Alcohol and depression: Evidence from the 2014 health survey for England - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectThe contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectMetacognitive beliefs are associated with anxiety and depression in diabetes.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectNegative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger most significant contributor.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectMetacognitive beliefs explain anxiety and depression beyond illness perceptions.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectMetacognitive model of emotional disorder has clinical utility in diabetes.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectAnxiety and depression are highly prevalent in people with diabetes (PwD). The most widely used psychological model to explain anxiety and depression in PwD is the Common-Sense Model, which gives a central role to illness perceptions. The Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model proposes metacognitive beliefs are key to understanding the development and maintenance of emotional disorders. To test the potential utility of the S-REF model in PwD, the study explored if metacognitive beliefs explained additional variance in anxiety and depression after controlling for demographic and illness perceptions.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectThe contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectRegression analyses showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with anxiety and depression in PwD and explained additional variance in both anxiety and depression after controlling for demographics and illness perceptions.The contribution of illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression in adults with diabetes - ScienceDirectThis is the first study to demonstrate that metacognitive beliefs are associated with anxiety and depression in PwD.

A subgroup repeated the screening measures two weeks later. All participants also completed a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID). For the screening measures we computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value with SCID diagnoses as the reference standard and conducted receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses; we also assessed internal consistency and test-retest reliability.The validity and reliability of screening measures for depression and anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectOf 253 participants, the SCID classified 10.3% with major depression and 14.6% with generalized anxiety disorder. Among the depression measures, the PHQ-9 had the highest sensitivity (84%). Specificity was generally higher than sensitivity, and was highest for the HADS-D with a cut-point of 11 (95%). In ROC analyses the area under the curve (AUC) did not differ between depression measures. Among the anxiety measures, sensitivity was highest for the HADS-A with a cut-point of 8 (82%). Specificity ranged from 83% to 86% for all measures except the HADS-A with a cut-point of 8 (68%). The AUC did not differ between anxiety measures.The validity and reliability of screening measures for depression and anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis - ScienceDirectOverall, performance of the depression and anxiety screening measures was very similar, with reasonable psychometric properties for the MS population, suggesting that other factors such as accessibility and ease of use could guide the choice of measure in clinical practice.Fear of violent crime and anxiety/depression among adolescents - ScienceDirectFear of crime has been associated with mental health outcomes. Yet, causal relationships have not been established. We examined the relationship between fear and mental health while accounting for potential endogeneity. A sample of 2329 adolescents from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods dataset was analyzed to assess the effect of fear of neighborhood violent crime on anxiety/depression. Instrumental variable (IV) methods were used to address endogeneity. There is evidence that the estimated effect of fear on depressive symptoms does not suffer from endogeneity bias in single-equation models. Adolescents who were more fearful had higher anxiety/depression scores. In adjusted analyses, for each one unit increase in fear (in this case, a move from one level of fear to the next), anxiety/depression scores increased by 1.32 points. There is support for the hypothesis that fear of neighborhood violent crime caused an increase in anxiety/depression scores among adolescents. Many programs address exposure to violence as a potential cause of depression, however few address the fear of violent victimization as a cause. Interventions and services should address fear as a root cause of anxiety/depression among adolescents.Fear of violent crime and anxiety/depression among adolescents - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Fear of violent crime and anxiety/depression among adolescents - ScienceDirectOn behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectAssociation between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectOdds of depression increase in subjects seropositive for herpes simplex-2.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectHigher IgG titers for cytomegalovirus were associated with depression.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectHepatitis A and B and herpes simplex-1 were not associated with depression.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectMood disorders are common mental illnesses. Among the factors associated with major depression are exposures to infectious diseases including hepatitis C, influenza, varicella-zoster, and herpes viruses. In this study, we sought to evaluate further associations between viral exposure and depression. From the US Center for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we obtained data about depression status, antidepressant use, exposure to hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus, and sociodemographic variables and evaluated associations between depression and viral exposure in adjusted multivariable models. Herpes simplex virus type 2 was associated with an increased risk of depression, whereas hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and herpes simplex virus type 1 were not. Higher cytomegalovirus antibody levels were associated with depression in subjects seropositive for cytomegalovirus. In conclusion, exposure to herpes simplex virus type 2 and possibly cytomegalovirus are associated with depression in an adult US sample.Association between virus exposure and depression in US adults - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectVariation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectSymptoms of depression and anxiety differ by menopausal status in midlife women.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectPerimenopause is associated with increased risk of greater symptoms of depression.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectPostmenopause is associated with increased risk of greater symptoms of anxiety.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectWomen without a history of symptoms may be at risk during perimenopause and postmenopause.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectTo examine the association between menopausal status and the risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety in a community-based sample of Australian midlife women.Variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectVariation in symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlife women by menopausal status - ScienceDirectSymptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Goldberg Depression Scale and Goldberg Anxiety Scale.

Animal models show that aversive caregiving alters effects of glucocorticoids (primarily corticosterone in rodents and cortisol in primates) on learning and neuroplasticity into adulthood.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectWe investigated whether history of childhood emotional abuse (EA) moderated effects of cortisol administration (CORT) versus placebo on emotional memory formation in depression. Participants included 75 unmedicated women with varying levels of depression severity and/or EA history. In a double-blind crossover investigation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure effects of CORT (vs. placebo) on neural function during emotional memory formation.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectCORT eliminated the well-known relationship between depression severity and negative memory bias, a finding explained by EA severity. For women with a history of severe EA, CORT reduced depression-related negative memory bias and normalized recall for pleasant stimuli. EA severity also moderated CORT effects on neural function: in women with history of severe EA, CORT increased activation in the supplementary motor area during viewing of unpleasant relative to pleasant pictures. Additionally, supplementary motor area activation predicted reduced negative bias for pictures encoded during CORT.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectThese results suggest that increasing cortisol signaling may be neurocognitively beneficial in depressed women with a history of maltreatment. The findings corroborate prior research suggesting that presence or absence of adverse caregiving is etiologically important in depression. These findings suggest potential neurocognitive mechanisms of therapeutics targeting cortisol signaling, which show promise in treating affective disorders.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias - ScienceDirectHCA and CPF contributed equally to this work.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectMethods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectEEG based measures for detection of depression.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectMethods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectNo single superior measure to detect depression.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectHigh depression detection sensitivity by combining measures from single EEG channel.Methods for classifying depression in single channel EEG using linear and nonlinear signal analysis - ScienceDirectDepressive disorder is one of the leading causes of burden of disease today and it is presumed to take the first place in the world in 2030.

The ability to switch neural resources between default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) has been proposed as a key mechanism for adaptive mood regulation. The anterior insula is implicated in the modulation of functional network switching. Differential connectivity between anterior insula and functional networks may provide insights into pathophysiological differences between bipolar and unipolar mood disorders, with implications for diagnosis and treatment.Functional connectivity between anterior insula and key nodes of frontoparietal executive control and salience networks distinguish bipolar depression from unipolar depression and healthy controls - ScienceDirectResting state fMRI data were collected from 98 subjects (35 unipolar, 24 bipolar and 39 healthy controls). Pearson correlations were computed between bilateral insula seed regions and a priori defined target regions from the DMN, SN, and ECN. After r-to-z transformation, a one-way MANCOVA was conducted to identify significant differences in connectivity between groups. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted and Bonferroni corrections were applied. Receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) were computed to assess diagnostic sensitivity.Functional connectivity between anterior insula and key nodes of frontoparietal executive control and salience networks distinguish bipolar depression from unipolar depression and healthy controls - ScienceDirectBipolar patients evidenced significantly altered right anterior insula functional connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the ECN relative to unipolar patients and controls.

The LTC 2.0 policy includes the aim to early detect people with cognitive impairment in the community to prevent from further deterioration to Dementia.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectIt has been well documented that the relationship between functional limitations and cognitive impairments. Although exist some measurements of Dementia and cognitive impairments, it is not easy for family caregivers or frontier care workers in the community to detect early Dementia. Since disability is more visible than mental health in practice, it could be useful to include both disability and depression to detect cognitive impairment.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThis is the first study to examine the interrelationship between disability, depression and cognitive impairment by using path analysis for the community-dwellings aged 65 and over in Taiwan.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectIn the study, it was found that disability and depression may independently or jointly contribute to the cognitive impairment. Disability may also mediate the relationship between depression and cognitive impairment.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectSince geriatric conditions were associated with higher cognitive impairment among those who are female and very old, early assessment could be arranged to this high-risk subgroup to reduce the incidence of future Dementia.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThere is increasing evidence that subtle losses in cognitive function may be symptomatic of a transition to early dementia. The objectives of this study were to: 1) test the effect of depressive symptoms and/or disability on cognitive impairment, 2) explore the interaction between depression and disability and the association with cognitive impairment, and 3) evaluate risk factors of health assessment to discriminate between elderly people with or without cognitive impairment.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThe subjects were the community-dwellings aged 65 years and over who live in the sample city of southern Taiwan. 2734 persons were recruited by random sampling in the community, and the data was collected with face to face interviews by the training interviewers.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThe effect of disability on cognitive impairment is stronger than the effect in depression.

Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but little is known about its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectThe sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectIrritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%. Children with higher levels of irritability or DMDD were more likely to have comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and a family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectResults are based on a clinical sample, so may not be generalizable to children with ADHD in the general population.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectIrritability and DMDD were common, and were associated with markers of depression liability.

However, effective delivery of GCBT for depression in primary care settings is often impeded by high dropout rates and poor homework adherence. In this study, we describe the structure, processes, and outcomes (including attendance, homework completion, and symptom measures) of GCBT for Spanish-speaking Latino patients with depression in an urban public sector primary care setting. For this study, 96 Latino patients in a primary care clinic participated in at least 1 session of GCBT. Although depressive symptoms among these patients, as measured by the PHQ-9, significantly decreased during treatment, attendance and homework completion were limited. Even with a strategy in place to allow patients to continue in treatment after missing several sessions, 23% of patients dropped out of therapy following their initial session, and approximately half of all patients completed less than 50% (or 8) therapy sessions. Homework was only completed 23% of the time it was checked. Greater session attendance prospectively predicted lower depressive symptoms over time. We discuss potential strategies to increase engagement, treatment effects, and symptom reduction for depression in primary care settings.Implementing Group CBT for Depression Among Latinos in a Primary Care Clinic - ScienceDirectA longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectA longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking and perfectionism are associated with depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirect71 women were assessed in their third trimester of pregnancy and post birth.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectAntenatal perfectionism lead to antenatal repetitive negative thinking.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking was associated with antenatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectFuture research should examine treatments for these processes in perinatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking and perfectionism have both been proposed as processes that are related to depressive symptoms. The purpose of this study was to investigate concurrent and prospective relationships between antenatal and postnatal depression, perfectionism, and repetitive negative thinking. A longitudinal design was used and 71 women were followed from their third trimester of pregnancy to six weeks post birth. A structural equation model was tested with antenatal perfectionism predicting antenatal repetitive negative thinking, perfectionism predicting postnatal depression, and antenatal repetitive negative thinking predicting antenatal and postnatal depression. The final model provided an adequate fit to the data but the pathway from antenatal repetitive negative thinking to postnatal depression was not significant. The findings provide support for the role of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in the onset and maintenance of perinatal symptoms of depression. It is suggested that future research investigates the efficacy of targeting repetitive negative thinking and perfectionism in pregnancy to examine if this can reduce perinatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAssociation between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectThis study included almost 12900 type 2 diabetes patients with or without depression.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAt the end of follow-up, 67.5% of depression cases were persistent with antidiabetics.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAt the end of follow-up, 69.7% of controls were persistent with antidiabetics.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectDepression had no significant impact on persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectThe goal of the present work was to study the impact of depression on persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients followed in general practices in Germany. We included T2DM patients who were treated with oral antihyperglycemic drugs and had an initial diagnosis of depression from 1262 general practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2015. T2DM controls without depression were included and matched (1:1) to T2DM cases with depression based on age, sex, physician, and initial antihyperglycemic therapy, using a propensity score method. Persistence was estimated as therapy duration without treatment disruption, which was defined as at least 3 months without oral antihyperglycemic drugs. This study included 6449 T2DM patients with depression and 6449 T2DM patients without depression. After 12 months of follow-up, 67.5% of cases with depression and 69.7% of controls without depression were found to be persistent with oral antihyperglycemic drugs (p = 0.627). Depression had no significant impact on persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs in the entire population (HR = 1.03) or in the different subgroups (HRs ranging from 1.00 to 1.06).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes predicted mothers' depressive-symptom trajectories over a 27-year period following the birth of a baby.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectLongitudinal study.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectParticipants comprised a sub-group of women from the longitudinal cohort of the Mater and University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy. Maternal depression was measured at six time points from the first clinic visit of an index pregnancy to 27 years after birth. A semi-parametric mixture model was used to identify three symptom trajectories of low-stable, moderate-stable and moderate-rising depression. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to determine whether a number of commonly occurring birth outcomes predicted moderate-stable and/or moderate-rising depression trajectories over the subsequent 27 years. Sociodemographic and behavioural factors were used to adjust for possible confounding.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectAfter adjustment for potential confounders, none of the adverse birth outcomes predicted subsequent maternal depression trajectories. Teenage pregnancy, not completing high school, low family income, obesity, poorer quality partnership and not exercising, measured at women's first clinic visit, and small social networks at three to five days after birth, were significantly associated with women's moderate-rising depressive-symptoms trajectory over 27 years.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectCommonly occurring adverse birth outcomes do not predict long-term depressive trajectories.

Next, we found that PPM1F messenger RNA levels in human blood were downregulated in cases with symptoms of comorbid PTSD and depression and consistently in cases with anxiety symptoms in a separate human dataset. Furthermore, we showed that a genetic variant of PPM1F, rs17759843, was associated with comorbid PTSD and depression and with PPM1F expression in both human brain and blood. Given prior reported mechanistic links between PPM1F and CAMK2 (CAMKII), we examined blood messenger RNA level of CAMK2G in humans and found it to be lower in cases with comorbid PTSD and depression. We also found that PPM1F protein levels and colocalization with CAMK2G were altered in amygdala and mPFC of male mice. Additionally, we found that a systemic dose of corticosterone blocked the depressive-like phenotype elicited by stress in female mice. Lastly, corticosterone rescued the anxiety-like phenotype and messenger RNA levels of Ppm1f in amygdala and mPFC in male mice and in mPFC of female mice.Expression of the PPM1F Gene Is Regulated by Stress and Associated With Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectTaken together, our data suggest a mechanistic pathway involving PPM1F and CAMK2G in stress- and trauma-related manifestation of anxiety and depression across species.Expression of the PPM1F Gene Is Regulated by Stress and Associated With Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectSocial capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectA nationally representative sample of the Korean population used in the study.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirect5969 people aged 60 years or older were included as the sample.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectCognitive social capital included interpersonal trust and reciprocity.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectSignificant association of cognitive social capital with depression in the elderly.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectReciprocity level mediated the association between income level and depression.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectA growing body of evidence has suggested that social capital is an upstream social determinant of mental health. We investigated the association of cognitive social capital, including interpersonal trust and reciprocity, with depressive symptoms in the elderly. We also explored the mediating role of cognitive social capital in the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and depressive symptoms and the moderating effect of SES on the relationship between social capital and depressive symptoms. Data from the 2012 Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) was analyzed for 5969 participants aged 60 years or older. Cognitive components of social capital, including interpersonal trust and reciprocity, were evaluated using single-item questionnaires. Socioeconomic and health-related characteristics were investigated and depressive symptoms were evaluated by an 11-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Low interpersonal trust and reciprocity levels were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly. Reciprocity level mediated the association between household income level and depressive symptoms. We did not observe any significant moderating effect of SES on the association between cognitive social capital and depressive symptoms. A significant association between cognitive social capital and depressive symptoms in Korean elderly was found. We elucidated how SES interacted with depressive symptoms through the mediation pathway of cognitive social capital using a representative sample of the Korean elderly population.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sticking with it?

We quantified depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and performed multivariable analyses on 2 outcome measures: (1) carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms (Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire [BCTQ]) and (2) palmar pain, focusing on preoperative CES-D and BCTQ score, sex, age, alcohol use, diabetes, and severity of nerve conduction abnormalities.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectWe included 227 patients. Before surgery, patients with depression had a higher BCTQ score than patients without depression. After 1 year, depressed patients had a higher BCTQ score and more palmar pain. The CES-D decreased by a median of 2 points from baseline to 1 year. This correlated with the decrease in BCTQ score. Multivariable analyses showed that preoperative depression had a small but statistically significant influence on palmar pain, but not on postoperative BCTQ score.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectDepression is not an independent predictor of residual CTS symptoms 1 year after CTR. Depressive symptoms in patients with CTS decrease after CTR, along with a decrease in CTS symptoms. The nature of this relationship is unknown. Patients with CTS and depression may expect a somewhat higher degree of palmar pain after CTR, the clinical relevance of which is small.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectPrognostic II.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectNo benefits in any form have been received or will be received related directly or indirectly to the subject of this article.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectThe influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectMore depressed users are inclined to do more broadcasting activities.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectThe type of activity is more important than the direction of it.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectNeuroticism moderates the effect of depression on communication behaviors.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectEstablished literature supports the notion that depressed individuals tend to be socially maladjusted and behave differently from those who aren't depressed. Yet, previous studies seem to overlook the influence of personality on behavior. Particularly, neuroticism may moderate the effect of depression on the way people behave. As one of the Big-Five factors of personality, neuroticism refers to a trait of one's capability to control emotional distress. Based on behavioral data from 393 Facebook users, current research demonstrates the interaction between depression and personality. Users engaged in activities at different levels of activities corresponding to their depression levels. Further, the effect of depression on social networking was regulated by personality: once neuroticism exceeded certain points, an increase in depression led to a decrease in social networking activities.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectSpecificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional and memory bias do not overlap in explaining depressive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably related to depressive symptoms, but not to anxiety symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably related to mood and cognitive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional bias is not related to depressive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional and memory biases are viewed as crucial cognitive processes underlying symptoms of depression.

The LTC 2.0 policy includes the aim to early detect people with cognitive impairment in the community to prevent from further deterioration to Dementia.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectIt has been well documented that the relationship between functional limitations and cognitive impairments. Although exist some measurements of Dementia and cognitive impairments, it is not easy for family caregivers or frontier care workers in the community to detect early Dementia. Since disability is more visible than mental health in practice, it could be useful to include both disability and depression to detect cognitive impairment.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThis is the first study to examine the interrelationship between disability, depression and cognitive impairment by using path analysis for the community-dwellings aged 65 and over in Taiwan.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectIn the study, it was found that disability and depression may independently or jointly contribute to the cognitive impairment. Disability may also mediate the relationship between depression and cognitive impairment.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectSince geriatric conditions were associated with higher cognitive impairment among those who are female and very old, early assessment could be arranged to this high-risk subgroup to reduce the incidence of future Dementia.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThere is increasing evidence that subtle losses in cognitive function may be symptomatic of a transition to early dementia. The objectives of this study were to: 1) test the effect of depressive symptoms and/or disability on cognitive impairment, 2) explore the interaction between depression and disability and the association with cognitive impairment, and 3) evaluate risk factors of health assessment to discriminate between elderly people with or without cognitive impairment.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThe subjects were the community-dwellings aged 65 years and over who live in the sample city of southern Taiwan. 2734 persons were recruited by random sampling in the community, and the data was collected with face to face interviews by the training interviewers.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThe effect of disability on cognitive impairment is stronger than the effect in depression. It also implies the possibility that disability may mediate the association between depression and cognitive impairment. Screening for risk factors of cognitive impairment was defined in this study and may be feasible for general population.The effect of disability and depression on cognitive function and screening factors - ScienceDirectThis study suggests that disability and depression assessments may serve as useful predictors of cognitive impairment. It is hoped that for elderly people, early assessment through screening factors could be arranged to this high-risk subgroup to reduce the risk of developing future dementia.

Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but little is known about its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectThe sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectIrritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%. Children with higher levels of irritability or DMDD were more likely to have comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and a family history of depression.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectResults are based on a clinical sample, so may not be generalizable to children with ADHD in the general population.Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability - ScienceDirectIrritability and DMDD were common, and were associated with markers of depression liability.

However, effective delivery of GCBT for depression in primary care settings is often impeded by high dropout rates and poor homework adherence. In this study, we describe the structure, processes, and outcomes (including attendance, homework completion, and symptom measures) of GCBT for Spanish-speaking Latino patients with depression in an urban public sector primary care setting. For this study, 96 Latino patients in a primary care clinic participated in at least 1 session of GCBT. Although depressive symptoms among these patients, as measured by the PHQ-9, significantly decreased during treatment, attendance and homework completion were limited. Even with a strategy in place to allow patients to continue in treatment after missing several sessions, 23% of patients dropped out of therapy following their initial session, and approximately half of all patients completed less than 50% (or 8) therapy sessions. Homework was only completed 23% of the time it was checked. Greater session attendance prospectively predicted lower depressive symptoms over time. We discuss potential strategies to increase engagement, treatment effects, and symptom reduction for depression in primary care settings.Implementing Group CBT for Depression Among Latinos in a Primary Care Clinic - ScienceDirectThe recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectThe recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectAvailability of current animal models of depressionThe recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectCritical evaluation of behavioral paradigms being used to phenotype depression in animals.The recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectAvailability genetic models of depression and their usefulnessThe recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectDiscuss current challenges and future studies to focus on the underlying mechanism on depression and resilienceThe recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectMajor depression disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental illness with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the growing number of studies that have emerged, the precise underlying mechanisms of MDD remain unknown. When studying MDD, tissue samples like peripheral blood or post-mortem brain samples are used to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Unfortunately, there are many uncontrollable factors with such samples such as medication history, age, time after death before post-mortem tissue was collected, age, sex, race, and living conditions. Although these factors are critical, they introduce confounding variables that can influence the outcome profoundly. In this regard, animal models provide a crucial approach to examine neural circuitry and molecular and cellular pathways in a controlled environment. Further, manipulations with pharmacological agents and gene editing are accepted methods of studying depression in animal models, which is impossible to employ in human patient studies. Here, we have reviewed the most widely used animal models of depression and delineated the salient features of each model in terms of behavioral and neurobiological outcomes. We have also illustrated the current challenges in using these models and have suggested strategies to delineate the underlying mechanism associated with vulnerability or resilience to developing depression.The recent progress in animal models of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectA longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking and perfectionism are associated with depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirect71 women were assessed in their third trimester of pregnancy and post birth.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectAntenatal perfectionism lead to antenatal repetitive negative thinking.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking was associated with antenatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectFuture research should examine treatments for these processes in perinatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectRepetitive negative thinking and perfectionism have both been proposed as processes that are related to depressive symptoms. The purpose of this study was to investigate concurrent and prospective relationships between antenatal and postnatal depression, perfectionism, and repetitive negative thinking. A longitudinal design was used and 71 women were followed from their third trimester of pregnancy to six weeks post birth. A structural equation model was tested with antenatal perfectionism predicting antenatal repetitive negative thinking, perfectionism predicting postnatal depression, and antenatal repetitive negative thinking predicting antenatal and postnatal depression. The final model provided an adequate fit to the data but the pathway from antenatal repetitive negative thinking to postnatal depression was not significant. The findings provide support for the role of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in the onset and maintenance of perinatal symptoms of depression. It is suggested that future research investigates the efficacy of targeting repetitive negative thinking and perfectionism in pregnancy to examine if this can reduce perinatal depression.A longitudinal investigation of perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking in perinatal depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAssociation between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectThis study included almost 12900 type 2 diabetes patients with or without depression.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAt the end of follow-up, 67.5% of depression cases were persistent with antidiabetics.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectAt the end of follow-up, 69.7% of controls were persistent with antidiabetics.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectDepression had no significant impact on persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectThe goal of the present work was to study the impact of depression on persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients followed in general practices in Germany. We included T2DM patients who were treated with oral antihyperglycemic drugs and had an initial diagnosis of depression from 1262 general practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2015. T2DM controls without depression were included and matched (1:1) to T2DM cases with depression based on age, sex, physician, and initial antihyperglycemic therapy, using a propensity score method. Persistence was estimated as therapy duration without treatment disruption, which was defined as at least 3 months without oral antihyperglycemic drugs. This study included 6449 T2DM patients with depression and 6449 T2DM patients without depression. After 12 months of follow-up, 67.5% of cases with depression and 69.7% of controls without depression were found to be persistent with oral antihyperglycemic drugs (p = 0.627). Depression had no significant impact on persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs in the entire population (HR = 1.03) or in the different subgroups (HRs ranging from 1.00 to 1.06). Depression was not significantly associated with persistence with antihyperglycemic drugs in Germany.Association between depression and persistence with oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Germany - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectCeramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectAberrant sphingolipid metabolism is commonly present in depression.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectCeramides have been implicated in depression due to pro-apoptotic characteristics.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectCeramides C18:0 and C20:0 are most strongly linked to depression in humans.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectPharmacologic reduction of certain ceramide species should be explored as treatment.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectMajor depressive disorder is a significant contributor to global disability and mortality. The mechanisms of depression are vast and not fully understood, and as a result current treatment of depression is suboptimal. Aberrant sphingolipid metabolism has been observed in some cases of depression, specifically alterations in ceramide concentrations. The role of ceramides and other sphingolipids in depression is a novel concept. This review summarizes and evaluates the current state of evidence for a role of ceramides in depression pathophysiology and the potential for novel depression pharmacotherapies targeting ceramide metabolism.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectMedline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched through October 2016 for English-language studies using combinations of the search terms: ceramide, depression, sphingolipid, and depressive symptoms.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectOf the 489 articles screened, 14 were included in the qualitative synthesis of this review article. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that ceramide species may contribute to depression pathophysiology. In human studies, ceramides C18:0 and C20:0 are the species most strongly linked to depression. Evidence for altered ceramide metabolism in depression is present, but data for a causal role of ceramides in depression are lacking.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectThis review was limited by potential reporting bias. Furthermore, a lack of specificity of which ceramides were altered in depression was common.Ceramides and depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectPharmacotherapy targeting ceramide metabolism may be a novel treatment option for depression. A number of pharmacological targets exists for ceramide reduction and a number of currently approved medications inhibit ceramide production.

Meta-analytic evidence indicates that volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala, as well as compromised white matter integrity are frequently observed in depressed adults. Exercise has shown promise as an effective treatment for depression, but few studies have attempted to characterize or identify the neural mechanisms of these effects. In this review, we examined the overlap between structural brain abnormalities in depression and the effects of exercise on brain structure in adults, to highlight possible neural mechanisms that may mediate the positive effects of exercise on depressive symptoms. The prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum emerged as structural neural markers that may serve as targets for exercise-based treatments for depression. These findings highlight the need for randomized exercise interventions to test these proposed neurobiological mechanisms of exercise on depression.Exercise effects on depression: Possible neural mechanisms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Improvement in Depression is Associated with Improvement in Cognition in Late-Life Psychotic Depression - ScienceDirectTo characterize cognitive function at baseline and investigate the relationship between change in cognition, depression, and psychosis after treatment among older adults with major depressive disorder with psychotic features.Improvement in Depression is Associated with Improvement in Cognition in Late-Life Psychotic Depression - ScienceDirectImprovement in Depression is Associated with Improvement in Cognition in Late-Life Psychotic Depression - ScienceDirectAt baseline, Young Old and Older participants did not differ on measures of depression severity or global cognition, information processing speed, and executive function.

Maternal depression was measured at six time points from the first clinic visit of an index pregnancy to 27 years after birth. A semi-parametric mixture model was used to identify three symptom trajectories of low-stable, moderate-stable and moderate-rising depression. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to determine whether a number of commonly occurring birth outcomes predicted moderate-stable and/or moderate-rising depression trajectories over the subsequent 27 years. Sociodemographic and behavioural factors were used to adjust for possible confounding.Commonly occurring adverse birth outcomes and maternal depression: a longitudinal study - ScienceDirectAfter adjustment for potential confounders, none of the adverse birth outcomes predicted subsequent maternal depression trajectories.

Next, we found that PPM1F messenger RNA levels in human blood were downregulated in cases with symptoms of comorbid PTSD and depression and consistently in cases with anxiety symptoms in a separate human dataset. Furthermore, we showed that a genetic variant of PPM1F, rs17759843, was associated with comorbid PTSD and depression and with PPM1F expression in both human brain and blood. Given prior reported mechanistic links between PPM1F and CAMK2 (CAMKII), we examined blood messenger RNA level of CAMK2G in humans and found it to be lower in cases with comorbid PTSD and depression. We also found that PPM1F protein levels and colocalization with CAMK2G were altered in amygdala and mPFC of male mice. Additionally, we found that a systemic dose of corticosterone blocked the depressive-like phenotype elicited by stress in female mice. Lastly, corticosterone rescued the anxiety-like phenotype and messenger RNA levels of Ppm1f in amygdala and mPFC in male mice and in mPFC of female mice.Expression of the PPM1F Gene Is Regulated by Stress and Associated With Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectTaken together, our data suggest a mechanistic pathway involving PPM1F and CAMK2G in stress- and trauma-related manifestation of anxiety and depression across species.Expression of the PPM1F Gene Is Regulated by Stress and Associated With Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectTo examine the relation between depressive symptoms and outcome of carpal tunnel release (CTR).Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectProspective study in a general hospital with data collection at baseline and 3 and 12 months after CTR. We quantified depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and performed multivariable analyses on 2 outcome measures: (1) carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms (Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire [BCTQ]) and (2) palmar pain, focusing on preoperative CES-D and BCTQ score, sex, age, alcohol use, diabetes, and severity of nerve conduction abnormalities.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectWe included 227 patients. Before surgery, patients with depression had a higher BCTQ score than patients without depression. After 1 year, depressed patients had a higher BCTQ score and more palmar pain. The CES-D decreased by a median of 2 points from baseline to 1 year. This correlated with the decrease in BCTQ score. Multivariable analyses showed that preoperative depression had a small but statistically significant influence on palmar pain, but not on postoperative BCTQ score.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectDepression is not an independent predictor of residual CTS symptoms 1 year after CTR. Depressive symptoms in patients with CTS decrease after CTR, along with a decrease in CTS symptoms. The nature of this relationship is unknown. Patients with CTS and depression may expect a somewhat higher degree of palmar pain after CTR, the clinical relevance of which is small.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectPrognostic II.Outcome of Carpal Tunnel Release and the Relation With Depression - ScienceDirectNo benefits in any form have been received or will be received related directly or indirectly to the subject of this article.Sticking with it?

We investigated the association of cognitive social capital, including interpersonal trust and reciprocity, with depressive symptoms in the elderly. We also explored the mediating role of cognitive social capital in the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and depressive symptoms and the moderating effect of SES on the relationship between social capital and depressive symptoms. Data from the 2012 Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) was analyzed for 5969 participants aged 60 years or older. Cognitive components of social capital, including interpersonal trust and reciprocity, were evaluated using single-item questionnaires. Socioeconomic and health-related characteristics were investigated and depressive symptoms were evaluated by an 11-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Low interpersonal trust and reciprocity levels were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly. Reciprocity level mediated the association between household income level and depressive symptoms. We did not observe any significant moderating effect of SES on the association between cognitive social capital and depressive symptoms. A significant association between cognitive social capital and depressive symptoms in Korean elderly was found. We elucidated how SES interacted with depressive symptoms through the mediation pathway of cognitive social capital using a representative sample of the Korean elderly population.Social capital, socioeconomic status, and depression in community-living elderly - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Negative interpretation of social cue in depression: Evidence from reading mind from eyes test - ScienceDirectA growing number of studies suggest that patients with depression exhibit tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli in a relatively negative manner.

Yet, previous studies seem to overlook the influence of personality on behavior. Particularly, neuroticism may moderate the effect of depression on the way people behave. As one of the Big-Five factors of personality, neuroticism refers to a trait of one's capability to control emotional distress. Based on behavioral data from 393 Facebook users, current research demonstrates the interaction between depression and personality. Users engaged in activities at different levels of activities corresponding to their depression levels. Further, the effect of depression on social networking was regulated by personality: once neuroticism exceeded certain points, an increase in depression led to a decrease in social networking activities.The influence of depression and personality on social networking - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectSpecificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional and memory bias do not overlap in explaining depressive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably related to depressive symptoms, but not to anxiety symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectMemory bias is reliably related to mood and cognitive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional bias is not related to depressive symptoms.Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression - ScienceDirectAttentional and memory biases are viewed as crucial cognitive processes underlying symptoms of depression.

However, very little is known about how stress response, neural processing of reward, and depression are related in very young children. The present study examined the concurrent associations between cortisol response following a stressor, functional brain activity to reward, and depression severity in children 4 to 6 years old.Amygdala Reward Reactivity Mediates the Association Between Preschool Stress Response and Depression Severity - ScienceDirectAmygdala Reward Reactivity Mediates the Association Between Preschool Stress Response and Depression Severity - ScienceDirectGreater caudate and medial prefrontal cortex reactivity to gain outcomes and increased amygdala reactivity to salient (i.e., both gain and loss) outcomes were observed. Higher total cortisol output following a stressor was associated with increased depression severity and reduced amygdala reactivity to salient outcomes. Amygdala reactivity was also inversely associated with depression severity and was found to mediate the relationship between cortisol output and depression severity.Amygdala Reward Reactivity Mediates the Association Between Preschool Stress Response and Depression Severity - ScienceDirectResults suggest that altered neural processing of reward is already related to increased cortisol output and depression severity in preschoolers. These results also demonstrate an important role for amygdala function as a mediator of this relationship at a very early age. Our results further underscore early childhood as an important developmental period for understanding the neurobiological correlates of early stress and increased risk for depression.Amygdala Reward Reactivity Mediates the Association Between Preschool Stress Response and Depression Severity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cognitive Issues: Decline, Delirium, Depression, Dementia - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectThe influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectThe relationship between alexithymia and mobile phone addiction for college students was examined.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectDepression, anxiety and stress were examined as a mediating variable.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectAlexithymia, depression, anxiety and stress were all significantly related to mobile phone addiction.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectDepression, anxiety or stress mediated the relationship between alexithymia and mobile phone addiction.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectThe influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectA total of 1105 college students were tested with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Mobile Phone Addiction Index.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectThe influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectLimitations included sampling method and modest sample size, self-report measures, and unmeasured potential confounders.The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress - ScienceDirectAlexithymia is an important correlate of mobile phone addiction, and depression, anxiety or stress is an important mediator in this relationship.Physician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectThe objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of computer-based screening and physician feedback to guide adolescent depression management within primary care.Physician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectPhysician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectPhysician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectWhen a computer-based decision support system algorithm focused on adolescent depression was implemented in two primary care clinics, a majority of physicians utilized screening results to guide clinical care.Physician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Physician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectConflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.Physician Intervention to Positive Depression Screens Among Adolescents in Primary Care - ScienceDirectClinical Trials Registry: NCT02244138.Effect of Urethroplasty on Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectand Objective: Anxiety and depression (AD) in patients with urethral stricture disease (USD) and the impact of urethroplasty on mental health has never been explored. We hypothesized that patients with USD will have higher than normal AD levels and urethroplasty would improve mental health.Effect of Urethroplasty on Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectEffect of Urethroplasty on Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirectMedian follow-up of the 298 that met inclusion criteria was 4.2 months. Preoperative AD was reported by 86 (29%) patients. Patients with AD reported higher rates of marijuana use, worse preoperative IIEF score (17.5 vs 19.6, p=0.01), and lower image of overall health (66 vs. 79, p=<0.001). Improvement or resolution of AD was experienced by 56% patients undergoing urethroplasty. De novo postoperative AD was reported by 10%. These men reported decreased flow rates (16 ml/sec vs 25 ml/sec; p=0.01). Clinical failure (8 patients, 2.7%) had no effect on the development, improvement, or resolution of AD.Effect of Urethroplasty on Anxiety and Depression - ScienceDirect56% of patients with preoperative AD reported improvement or resolution after urethroplasty.

The sample consisted of 307 psychiatry outpatients with mild to severe depression and past 30-day hazardous drinking/drug use, who participated in a trial of substance use treatment. Participants were assessed for AUD based on DSM-IV criteria. Measures of marijuana use, depression symptoms, and functional status related to mental health were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Differences in these outcomes were analyzed among patients with and without AUD using growth models, adjusting for treatment effects. Marijuana was examined as both an outcome (patterns of use) and a predictor (impact on depression and functioning). Forty percent used marijuana and about half the sample met AUD criteria. Fewer patients with AUD used marijuana than those without AUD at baseline. Over 6 months, the proportion of patients with AUD using marijuana increased compared to those without AUD. Patients with AUD using marijuana had greater depressive symptoms and worse functioning than those without AUD. These findings indicate that marijuana use is clinically problematic for psychiatry outpatients with depression and AUD. Addressing marijuana in the context of psychiatry treatment may help improve outcomes.Adherence to a Dash-style diet in relation to depression and aggression in adolescent girls - ScienceDirectAdherence to a Dash-style diet in relation to depression and aggression in adolescent girls - ScienceDirectGlobal burden of mental disorders is increasing.Adherence to a Dash-style diet in relation to depression and aggression in adolescent girls - ScienceDirectThe study included 580 Iranian adolescent girls.Adherence to a Dash-style diet in relation to depression and aggression in adolescent girls - ScienceDirectSignificant inverse relationship between more adherence to DASH-style diet and depression presence.Adherence to a Dash-style diet in relation to depression and aggression in adolescent girls - ScienceDirectDepression Is Associated with a Higher Risk of Death among Stroke Survivors - ScienceDirectPoststroke depression is common, affecting approximately 1 in 3 stroke survivors. We aimed to evaluate the association between depression and mortality in adults with and without prior stroke.Depression Is Associated with a Higher Risk of Death among Stroke Survivors - ScienceDirectUsing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (1982-1992), we investigated the association between depression and all-cause mortality among adults aged 25-74 years with and without prior stroke, and stroke mortality among stroke survivors, adjusting for covariates.Depression Is Associated with a Higher Risk of Death among Stroke Survivors - ScienceDirectAmong 9919 individuals, 121 (1.2%) reported prior stroke. The adjusted depression prevalence was 37.1% among stroke survivors and 17.3% among individuals without stroke. In persons aged 25-64 years, neither stroke nor depression was associated with all-cause mortality. The combination of depression and stroke was not associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] .67-12.04). Among persons aged 65-74 years, depression alone (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.47), stroke alone (adjusted HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.17-2.32), and the combination of depression and stroke (adjusted HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.79-2.90) were associated with all-cause mortality, consistent with an additive relationship. Among all ages, the combination of depression and stroke was associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.28-2.92). Higher stroke mortality was only observed in those aged 65-74 years (adjusted HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.60). Compared with stroke survivors without depression, those with depression were ~35 times more likely to die from a stroke (adjusted HR 35.33, 95% CI 7.79-160.32).Depression Is Associated with a Higher Risk of Death among Stroke Survivors - ScienceDirectThe combination of prior stroke and depression is associated with higher all-cause mortality than either condition alone. The presence of depression after stroke increases stroke mortality 35-fold, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating depression among stroke survivors.Depression Is Associated with a Higher Risk of Death among Stroke Survivors - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression Is Associated with a Higher Risk of Death among Stroke Survivors - ScienceDirectGrant support: This study was supported by the Roxanna Todd Hodges Foundation.The use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectThe use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectThe literature concerning the role of T3 in the treatment of bipolar depression is reviewed.The use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectThe evidence found is scarce and methodologically flawed.The use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectHowever, promising results are backed by the available literature.The use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectPossibility of T3 as adjunctive treatment, as protection against rapid cycling and against relapse.The use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectFurther research is needed.The use of triiodothyronine (T3) in the treatment of bipolar depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectThere is a paucity of treatment options for bipolar depression.

In spite of the high burden, depression is often unrecognized and undertreated. Inaccurate assessment is one of the important barriers for effective care. Clinical diagnosis is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of depression. However, the available instruments help to estimate the burden of depression in epidemiological studies as well as help to screen, diagnose and monitor the treatment in clinical practice. Screening instruments are very useful in community surveys, and can be used for referring patients to psychiatrists. Hence, there is a need to understand the different scales of depression, their advantages, limitations and psychometric properties. This article summarizes various available instruments for assessment of depression and their properties.Screening instruments for assessment of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Variation of genes involved in oxidative and nitrosative stresses in depression - ScienceDirectVariation of genes involved in oxidative and nitrosative stresses in depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Noninvasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in persons with symptoms of depression - ScienceDirectNoninvasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in persons with symptoms of depression - ScienceDirectDepression and depressive symptoms are globally prevalent and a medically treatable condition.Noninvasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in persons with symptoms of depression - ScienceDirectEarly screening of patients with depression for subclinical atherosclerosis can provide assessment of CVD burden.Noninvasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in persons with symptoms of depression - ScienceDirectCAC provides a noninvasive method for assessment of CVD burden and can be used for risk stratification of patients.Noninvasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in persons with symptoms of depression - ScienceDirectThose with higher burden of CVD can be offered preventive treatment in order to halt progression of atherosclerosis.Noninvasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in persons with symptoms of depression - ScienceDirectDepression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of loss of interest along with a cluster of clinical symptoms.

We examined the associations between OCD and depression symptoms in 87 adolescents with primary OCD. We computed an association network, a graphical LASSO, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model symptom interactions. Models showed OCD and depression as separate syndromes linked by bridge symptoms. Bridges between the two disorders emerged between obsessional problems in the OCD syndrome, and guilt, concentration problems, and sadness in the depression syndrome. A directed network indicated that OCD symptoms directionally precede depression symptoms. Concentration impairment emerged as a highly central node that may be distinctive to adolescents. We conclude that the network approach to mental disorders provides a new way to understand the etiology and maintenance of comorbid OCD-depression. Network analysis can improve research and treatment of mental disorder comorbidities by generating hypotheses concerning potential causal symptom structures and by identifying symptoms that may bridge disorders.A network perspective on comorbid depression in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (139KB)Download full-size imageAssessing the Association Between Depression and Savings for Kenyan Youth Using a Validated Child Depression Inventory Measure - ScienceDirectThe Child Depression Inventory (CDI) is a commonly used measure of depression among youth and has been used in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrating positive effects of financial asset-building interventions on physical and mental health outcomes.

Supporting predictions, socially prescribed perfectionism yielded a weaker relationship with depression than did anxiety, shame, and accepting the past.An investigation of vulnerability factors for depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectAntenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectAntenatal depression is predicted by a lifetime history of depression.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectAntenatal depressive symptoms strongly predict depressive and anxiety postpartum symptoms.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectThe incidence of depression significantly decreases from the prenatal to the postpartum period.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectDelivery significantly improves depressive and anxiety symptoms.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectPrenatal hematocrit levels significantly predict postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectAntenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms - ScienceDirecthttp://scholar.google.co.th/citations?user=1wzMZ7UAAAAJ&hl=th&oi=ao.Exercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise intensity matters for management of depression, anxiety and stress.Exercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectHigh intensity exercise increased stress and IL-6.Exercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise may help to mitigate symptoms of depression by reducing inflammation; however, little is known about the influence of exercise intensity on depressed mood.Exercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectExercise reduces depression and inflammation but intensity matters - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cortical Spreading Depression and Ischemia in Neurocritical Patients - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Cortical Spreading Depression and Ischemia in Neurocritical Patients - ScienceDirectDisclosure Statement: The authors have nothing to disclose.Evaluation of Depression and Suicidal Patients in the Emergency Room - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evaluation of Depression and Suicidal Patients in the Emergency Room - ScienceDirectThe authors deny any financial conflicts of interest.Understanding the pathophysiology of depression: From monoamines to the neurogenesis hypothesis model - are we there yet?

- ScienceDirectA number of factors (biogenic amine deficiency, genetic, environmental, immunologic, endocrine factors and neurogenesis) have been identified as mechanisms which provide unitary explanations for the pathophysiology of depression. Rather than a unitary construct, the combination and linkage of these factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. That is, environmental stressors and heritable genetic factors acting through immunologic and endocrine responses initiate structural and functional changes in many brain regions, resulting in dysfunctional neurogenesis and neurotransmission which then manifest as a constellation of symptoms which present as depression.Understanding the pathophysiology of depression: From monoamines to the neurogenesis hypothesis model - are we there yet? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectAnxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectMetacognitive beliefs and processes examined in anxiety and depression in epilepsy.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectNegative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger most significant contributor.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectMetacognitive beliefs explain distress beyond known predictors of distress.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectMetacognitive model of emotional disorder applicable in epilepsy.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectAnxiety and depressive disorders frequently occur in people with epilepsy (PWE). An information processing model of psychopathology, the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model specifies that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and processes play a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and depression. This study explored whether metacognitive beliefs would explain additional variance in anxiety and depression after accounting for demographics, physical and/or psychiatric illnesses, epilepsy characteristics and medication issues. The mediational relationships between metacognitive beliefs, worry and anxiety and depression, predicted by the metacognitive model were also explored,Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectThree hundred and forty-nine PWE participated in an online survey and completed self-report questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, metacognitive beliefs and worry. Participants also provided information on epilepsy characteristics, demographics, comorbid physical and/or psychiatric illnesses, number of, and perceived side effects of, anti-epileptic medication.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectRegression analysis showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and explained additional variance in these outcomes after accounting for the control variables. Furthermore, the fundamental tenet of the metacognitive model was supported; the relationship between negative metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry and anxious and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by worry.Anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy: The contribution of metacognitive beliefs - ScienceDirectThis is the first study to demonstrate that metacognitive beliefs and processes contribute to anxiety and depression beyond variables often associated with emotional distress in PWE.

The study was a cross sectional study. Data were collected from 120 psychiatric patients, aged 22 to 37 years. A battery of self-report questionnaires was administered for tapping IU, worry, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results from indirect effects analyses revealed that even though IU, worry, depression, and anxiety symptoms correlated moderately with each other, worry carried a substantial proportion of variance in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the relative effect was more pronounced for anxiety compared to depression symptoms. The results from hierarchical analyses supported the moderator role of worry. More specifically, a high level of worry enhanced the association between IU and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Given the potential for worry as a mechanism, and/or moderator between IU and symptoms of depression and anxiety, adults with a tendency to use this negative repetitive thought process (e.g. worry) may be at higher risk to develop psychological symptoms.Intolerance of uncertainty, depression, and anxiety: Examining the indirect and moderating effects of worry - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectAre there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectThere are no immune & oxidative (I&O) biomarker differences between major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectAtypical depression is associated with increased IL-6 trans-signaling and lipid peroxidation.Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectSeverity of depression, number of episodes and suicidal attempts are associated with activated I&O pathways.Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectIncreased TBARS is the single best predictor of BD/MDD, atypical depression, melancholia and current suicidal ideation.Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectThere is evidence that major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are accompanied by activated immune & oxidative (I&O) pathways.Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectAre there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectAre there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectThere are no I&O biomarker differences between MDD and BD.

Increased TBARS is the single best predictor of BD/MDD, atypical depression, melancholia and current suicidal ideation.Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Risk Factors for Depression: Differential Across Age? - ScienceDirectRisk Factors for Depression: Differential Across Age? - ScienceDirectRisk Factors for Depression: Differential Across Age? - ScienceDirectThe occurrence of all risk factors differed significantly across age groups. Although most risk factors had significant associations with depression across the lifespan, for five risk factors the strength of the association was age-dependent. Stronger associations with depression in younger age were found for childhood abuse, pain, higher body mass index (BMI) and number of chronic diseases, whereas low income imposed a stronger risk in older age. Associations with depression were strongest in age groups where occurrence was lowest.Risk Factors for Depression: Differential Across Age? - ScienceDirectAlthough the exposure to risk factors changes across the lifespan, the relative risk associating them to depression remains similar for most risk factors. Some specific risk factors (low income, and health factors pain, BMI, and number of chronic diseases), however, seem more strongly associated with depression in ages in which occurrence is lowest and least expected.Risk Factors for Depression: Differential Across Age? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectSleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectBoth short and long sleep duration were significantly associated with depression.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectAll types of sleep disturbances were significantly associated with depression.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectSleep disturbances combined with long duration had the most likelihood of depression.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectA dose-response relationship was found between the number of sleep disturbances and depression.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectMixed results have shown the association between sleep behavior and depression, but evidence relating the joint effect of sleep duration and sleep disturbances is limited, especially in Chinese population.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectSleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectSleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectThe cross-sectional nature of the study design limits the interpretation of the results.Sleep behavior and depression: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 million Chinese adults - ScienceDirectAbnormal sleep duration and sleep disturbances were associated with depression.

Exposure to elevated manganese during this critically vulnerable period has been found to be neurotoxic. Independently, maternal prenatal depression has been associated with subsequent neurodevelopmental decrements in children. The association between child neurodevelopment and prenatal co-exposure to manganese and maternal depression has not been sufficiently studied.Prenatal co-exposure to manganese and depression and 24-months neurodevelopment - ScienceDirectDuring pregnancy and at birth, we measured maternal blood and cord blood manganese levels respectively. Maternal depression was assessed in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy using the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Neurodevelopment was evaluated at 24 months of age with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. A multivariate multiple regression model was used to analyze cognitive, language and motor scores simultaneously for 473 children from the PROGRESS birth cohort in Mexico City.Prenatal co-exposure to manganese and depression and 24-months neurodevelopment - ScienceDirectOver 25% of our study participants reported having depressive symptoms. 3rd trimester blood manganese as well as depressive symptoms were independently negatively associated with all neurodevelopment scores in adjusted models. In stratified analyses, the negative association between manganese (maternal as well as cord blood) and 24-month language scores was stronger among women with depressive symptoms. Receptive language was mostly affected. Inverted U-shaped curves were seen for the association between with cord blood manganese and neurodevelopment scores.Prenatal co-exposure to manganese and depression and 24-months neurodevelopment - ScienceDirectOur findings are in line with previous studies of manganese and depression neurotoxicity. The prenatal period may be particularly sensitive to manganese and depression co-exposures and should be of interest for public health interventions to promote healthy emotional and nutritional pregnancies.Social capital and antenatal depression among Chinese primiparas: A cross-sectional survey - ScienceDirectSocial capital and antenatal depression among Chinese primiparas: A cross-sectional survey - ScienceDirectLower social capital sub-groups had higher likelihood of antenatal depression.Social capital and antenatal depression among Chinese primiparas: A cross-sectional survey - ScienceDirectSocial capital and antenatal depression among Chinese primiparas: A cross-sectional survey - ScienceDirectCompared to the structural social capital, the cognitive social capital was more important to antenatal depression.Social capital and antenatal depression among Chinese primiparas: A cross-sectional survey - ScienceDirectSocial capital and antenatal depression among Chinese primiparas: A cross-sectional survey - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Functional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectFunctional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectThe FC between aDMN and SAL positively correlated with PSD severity.Functional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectThe FC between aDMN and LFP decreased after treatment of PSD.Functional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectThe FC between limbic regions changed after treatment of PSD.Functional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectChanges of FC in PSD and relation to depression severity resemble MDD findings.Functional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectPrevious studies have demonstrated altered resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD). It remains unclear whether rsFC is changed at the network level as was shown for major depressive disorder (MDD). To address this question, we investigated rsFC of resting sate networks (RSNs) in PSD.Functional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectFunctional connectivity between salience, default mode and frontoparietal networks in post-stroke depression - ScienceDirectWe found positive correlation of FNC between anterior default mode network (aDMN) and salience network (SAL) with depression severity before treatment, the latter accompanied by the increase of white matter in the middle frontal and left angular gyri.

Up to 90% of individuals suffering from depression also report sleep and circadian disruptions. If these disruptions are not effectively resolved over the course of treatment, the likelihood of relapse into depression is greatly increased. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has shown promise in treating these sleep and circadian disturbances associated with depression, and may be effective as a stand-alone treatment for depression. This may be particularly relevant in cases where antidepressant medications are not ideal (e.g. due to contraindications, cost, or treatment resistance).Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to treat depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectA systematic literature review was conducted of trials investigating the use of CBT-I to treat depression in adults.

Animal models indicate that repeated access to palatable foods such as sugar induces depression and anxiety-like behavior when the food is no longer available. However, the neurobiological mechanisms of how dietary restriction influences mood have not been fully understood. We used the two-bottle sucrose choice paradigm as an overeating and withdrawal model. Withdrawal after lengthy sucrose overeating elicited depression and anxiety-like behavior, which was reversed by sucrose reinstatement. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of sucrose withdrawal animals, dopamine levels and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity were significantly reduced, while the inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir2.1, was significantly elevated. In addition, overexpression of Kir2.1 selectively in neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors was sufficient to induce negative mood-linked behavior in the absence of sucrose overeating experience. As elevated K+ channels reduce neuronal excitability, a sucrose withdrawal-induced increase in Kir2.1 expression is able to decrease NAc activity, which provides a cellular basis for depression and anxiety-like behavior in animals.Sucrose withdrawal induces depression and anxiety-like behavior by Kir2.1 upregulation in the nucleus accumbens - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectA comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectA meta-analysis on interpretation biases in depression was conductedA comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectResults revealed a medium overall effect size (ES)A comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectClinical status or mental imagery instructions were not significant moderatorsA comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectSelf-reference of stimuli and measurement method were significant moderatorsA comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectTheoretical and clinical implications with future directions are providedA comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectA comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectJonas Everaert is a postdoctoral research fellow at Yale University, USA.A comprehensive meta-analysis of interpretation biases in depression - ScienceDirectIoana R.

For this, 267 patients with schizophrenia were assessed on CDSS and HDRS. Exploratory factor analysis of CDSS yielded 2 factor models for the whole sample, patients in clinical remission and patients not in clinical remission phase of schizophrenia. Factor analysis of HDRS yielded 3 factor models; however, there was significant difference in the factor structure between those in clinical remission and those not in clinical remission phase of schizophrenia. CDSS total score did not correlate with PANSS positive and negative subscale scores. In contrast, HDRS total score correlated positively with PANSS positive subscale score, PANSS negative subscale score and PANSS general psychopathology subscale score. To conclude, present study suggests while CDSS items separate out into 2 factors, which are stable across different stages of illness, whereas HDRS factor structure appears to be less stable across different stages of illness. Correlation analysis suggests that rating on HDRS may be affected by positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas CDSS do not correlate with positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Scales for assessment of depression in schizophrenia: Factor analysis of calgary depression rating scale and hamilton depression rating scale - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Help from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectHelp from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectDepression is prevalent with access to treatment impaired by numerous factors.Help from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectThis novel RCT compared guided internet-delivered CBT with an unguided CBT book and an unguided meditation book.Help from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectAll three interventions were more effective in reducing depression than wait-list control at post-treatment.Help from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectNo significant differences existed between the intervention groups at post-treatment.Help from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectSelf-help treatments could be utilised for depression treatment but vigilance and monitoring needs to be applied.Help from home for depression: A randomised controlled trial comparing internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy with bibliotherapy for depression - ScienceDirectEpilepsy coexisting with depression - ScienceDirectDepression episodes in epilepsy is the most common commorbidity, affecting between 11% and 62% of patients with epilepsy.

Postdisaster major depression was examined in two disaster databases using consistent research methodology, permitting combination of databases into a combined dataset including 1181 survivors of 11 disasters representing all major disaster typologies with full diagnostic assessment using structured diagnostic interviews from two databases. The first database includes 808 directly-exposed survivors of 10 disasters. The second includes 373 survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City's World Trade Center, recruited from employees of eight organizations affected by the disaster. This rich dataset permitted comparison of predictors of postdisaster major depression between databases and across survivors of different disasters. Identical models applied to both databases found postdisaster major depression to be independently associated with pre-existing major depression, indirect exposure to disaster trauma through family/friends, and disaster-related PTSD. In a final model limited to directly-exposed disaster across both databases, postdisaster major depression was independently associated with terrorism in addition to the 3 variables that predicted postdisaster major depression in the two separate databases. Replication of findings from one model to the next across different types of disasters and populations in this study suggests that these three variables could potentially provide a powerful tool for estimating likelihood of postdisaster major depression.Prevalence and predictors of postdisaster major depression: Convergence of evidence from 11 disaster studies using consistent methods - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Patterns of Symptoms of Perinatal Depression and Stress in Late Adolescent and Young Adult Mothers - ScienceDirectPatterns of Symptoms of Perinatal Depression and Stress in Late Adolescent and Young Adult Mothers - ScienceDirectSecondary analysis of existing longitudinal data.Patterns of Symptoms of Perinatal Depression and Stress in Late Adolescent and Young Adult Mothers - ScienceDirectSan Francisco Bay Area, with participants in their home environments.Patterns of Symptoms of Perinatal Depression and Stress in Late Adolescent and Young Adult Mothers - ScienceDirectPatterns of Symptoms of Perinatal Depression and Stress in Late Adolescent and Young Adult Mothers - ScienceDirectThe Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to assess depression symptoms, the Maternal Adjustment and Maternal Attitudes Scale was used to assess maternal adjustment, and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress.

Approximately, one-third of them are affected by post-stroke depression (PSD), making it a serious social and public health problem and anti-depressant preventive and curative therapies worth investigating. However, a two-way association between depression and stroke has been also established: stroke increases the risk of PSD, but depression is an independent risk factor for stroke.Post-stroke depression: Mechanisms and pharmacological treatment - ScienceDirectThe pathophysiology of PSD is presumably multifactorial, involving a combination of various ischaemia-induced neurobiological dysfunctions in the context of psychosocial distress. The damage of frontal-basal ganglia brainstem pathway suggested alterations of monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Several lines of evidence point to a relationship between neuroinflammatory response to acute ischaemic stroke, stress activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the impairment of adaptive response (neurogenesis) within a background of altered energy metabolism (i.e. mitochondrial dysfunction).Post-stroke depression: Mechanisms and pharmacological treatment - ScienceDirectThe complexity of PSD mechanisms makes its biologically-based prevention and treatment a difficult task. So far, especially the selective serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have mainly proved to be clinically active in preventing and treating PSD, although their effects have not been demonstrated unequivocally and they may cause bleeding and intracerebral haemorrhage. Besides the primary pharmacological activity of SSRIs (i.e. the inhibition of neuronal 5-HT reuptake) there is evidence supporting their pleiotropic mechanisms of action: anti-inflammatory and enhanced neurogenesis through the up-regulation of neurotrophins, conceivably supported by the stimulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism.Post-stroke depression: Mechanisms and pharmacological treatment - ScienceDirectIn the future, novel developments might point at anti-cytokine modulators which can improve symptoms of depression, especially in subjects affected by inflammation processes.Post-stroke depression: Mechanisms and pharmacological treatment - ScienceDirectThis review will address the various areas of epidemiology, pathophysiology, preventive and therapeutic strategies for PSD.

Researches have demonstrated that depression is associated with the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), where its modulation can be evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV). Depression patients have lower HRV than healthy subjects. Therefore, HRV may be used to distinguish depression patients from healthy people.Depression recognition according to heart rate variability using Bayesian Networks - ScienceDirectHRV signals were collected from 76 female subjects composed of 38 depression patients and 38 healthy people. Time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear features were extracted from the HRV signals of these subjects, who were subjected to the Ewing test as an ANS stimulus. Then, these multiple features were input into Bayesian networks, served as a classifier, to distinguish depression patients from healthy people. Hence, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Depression recognition according to heart rate variability using Bayesian Networks - ScienceDirectRecognition results indicate 86.4% accuracy, 89.5% sensitivity, and 84.2% specificity. The individuals subjected to the Ewing test showed better recognition results than those at individual test states (resting state, deep breathing state, Valsalva state, and standing state) of the Ewing test. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of the HRV exhibits a significant relevance with recognition.Depression recognition according to heart rate variability using Bayesian Networks - ScienceDirectBayesian networks can be applied to the recognition of depression patients from healthy people and the recognition results demonstrate the significant association between depression and HRV. The Ewing test is a good ANS stimulus for acquiring the difference of HRV between depression patients and healthy people to recognize depression. The RMSSD of the HRV is important in recognition and may be a significant index in distinguishing depression patients from healthy people.Depression recognition according to heart rate variability using Bayesian Networks - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression recognition according to heart rate variability using Bayesian Networks - ScienceDirectNo.382, East Road of Outer Ring, Guangzhou College Town, Panyu District, Guangzhou City, China.Gender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectGender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectBoth genders had an increased risk of depression after >90-days opioid use.Gender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectFemale versus male veterans had a greater depression risk after >90-days opioid use.Gender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectNo gender difference in opioid-depression risk was found in the private sector.Gender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectCloser monitoring of mood related to chronic opioid use for some groups is needed.Gender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectGender and the Association between Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use and New-Onset Depression - ScienceDirectExisting research is mixed regarding gender differences in outcomes after long-term prescription opioid use.

Here, we examined sex differences and neural bases of depression in chronic ketamine users. Compared to non-drug using healthy controls (HC), ketamine-using females but not males showed increased depression score as assessed by the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). We evaluated resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), a prefrontal structure consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Compared to HC, ketamine users (KU) did not demonstrate significant changes in sgACC connectivities at a corrected threshold. However, in KU, a linear regression against CES-D score showed less sgACC connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with increasing depression severity. Examined separately, male and female KU showed higher sgACC connectivity to bilateral superior temporal gyrus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively, in correlation with depression. The linear correlation of sgACC-OFC and sgACC-dmPFC connectivity with depression was significantly different in slope between KU and HC. These findings highlighted changes in rsFC of the sgACC as associated with depression and sex differences in these changes in chronic ketamine users.Depression in chronic ketamine users: Sex differences and neural bases - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectThe effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectDepressive symptoms declined over the perinatal period, but rebounded for some women.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectTrauma, substance use, and relationship status predicted levels of depression.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectSingle relationship status predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectResearch suggests that trauma exposure is associated with perinatal depression; however, little is known about the nature of the relation between trauma history and trajectory of depression, as well as the predictive power of trauma history beyond other risk factors. Additionally, more research is needed in at-risk samples that are likely to experience severe traumatic exposure.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectSecondary data analysis was conducted using demographic and depression data from the Healthy Start and Empowerment Family Support programs in Des Moines, Iowa. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, from pregnancy to 24 months postpartum, and clarify whether trauma exposure, relationship status, and substance use uniquely contribute to trajectories of symptoms over time.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectOn average, depressive symptoms decreased from pregnancy to 24 months postpartum; however, trajectories varied across women. Single relationship status, substance use, and trauma history were each predictors of higher depression levels at several points in time across the observed perinatal period. Single relationship status was also associated with decline in depressive symptoms followed by a rebound of symptoms at 22 months postpartum.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectThese data were not collected for research purposes and thus did not undergo the rigorous data collection strategies typically implemented in an established research study.The effects of trauma on perinatal depression: Examining trajectories of depression from pregnancy through 24 months postpartum in an at-risk population - ScienceDirectHistory of trauma, substance use and single relationship status represent unique risk factors for perinatal depression.

Caregivers completed self-report inventories of depression.Empathic Accuracy Deficits in Patients with Neurodegenerative Disease: Association with Caregiver Depression - ScienceDirectLower empathic accuracy in patients was associated with greater depression in caregivers in both studies. In study 1, this association was found when empathic accuracy was measured using the dynamic tracking measure but not when measured using the more traditional photograph and film measures. In study 2, we found preliminary support for our theoretical model wherein lower empathic accuracy in patients is associated with increased caregiver stress (loneliness, strain, and burden), which in turn is associated with greater caregiver depression.Empathic Accuracy Deficits in Patients with Neurodegenerative Disease: Association with Caregiver Depression - ScienceDirectCaring for a patient with deficits in empathic accuracy is associated with greater loneliness, strain, and burden for caregivers, and increased depression.

Research in adolescent depression has focused on reward sensitivity and striatal mechanisms implementing it. The contribution of loss sensitivity to future depression, as well as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) mechanisms critical for processing losses and rewards, remains unexplored. Furthermore, it is unclear whether OFC functioning interacts with familial history in predicting future depression.Orbitofrontal Cortex Activity and Connectivity Predict Future Depression Symptoms in Adolescence - ScienceDirectOrbitofrontal Cortex Activity and Connectivity Predict Future Depression Symptoms in Adolescence - ScienceDirectReduced OFC response during loss was associated with higher depression symptoms concurrently and prospectively, even after controlling for concurrent depression, specifically in adolescents with parental history of depression. Similarly, increased OFC-posterior insula connectivity during loss was associated with future depression symptoms, but this relationship was not moderated by parental history of depression.Orbitofrontal Cortex Activity and Connectivity Predict Future Depression Symptoms in Adolescence - ScienceDirectThis study provides the first evidence for loss-related alterations in OFC functioning and its interaction with familial history of depression as possible mechanisms in the development of depression.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force only recently updated their recommendation on depression screening to specifically recommend screening during the pre- and postpartum periods. While practitioners in high-income countries can respond to this new recommendation by implementing one of several existing depression screening tools developed in Western contexts, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) or the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), these tools lack strong evidence of cross-cultural equivalence, validity for case finding, and precision in measuring response to treatment in developing countries. Thus, there is a critical need to develop and validate new screening tools for perinatal depression that can be used by lay health workers, primary health care personnel, and patients.Developing and validating a perinatal depression screening tool in Kenya blending Western criteria with local idioms: A mixed methods study - ScienceDirectWorking in rural Kenya, we used free listing, card sorting, and item analysis methods to develop a locally-relevant screening tool that blended Western psychiatric concepts with local idioms of distress. We conducted a validation study with a random sample of 193 pregnant women and new mothers to test the diagnostic accuracy of this scale along with the EPDS and PHQ-9.Developing and validating a perinatal depression screening tool in Kenya blending Western criteria with local idioms: A mixed methods study - ScienceDirectThe sensitivity/specificity of the EPDS and PHQ-9 was estimated to be 0.70/0.72 and 0.70/0.73, respectively. This compared to sensitivity/specificity of 0.90/0.90 for a new 9-item locally-developed tool called the Perinatal Depression Screening (PDEPS). Across these three tools, internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 and test-retest reliability ranged from 0.57 to 0.67. The prevalence of depression ranges from 5.2% to 6.2% depending on the clinical reference standard.Developing and validating a perinatal depression screening tool in Kenya blending Western criteria with local idioms: A mixed methods study - ScienceDirectThe EPDS and PHQ-9 are valid and reliable screening tools for perinatal depression in rural Western Kenya, the PDEPS may be a more useful alternative.

We estimated the incidence of TRD in Taiwan using a cohort of 704,265 adults randomly sampled from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research database for 2005. TRD was defined as a patient having pharmaceutically treated depression (PTD) not adequately responding to 2 antidepressant (AD) regimens, i.e., AD regimens that were followed by other AD regimens. Among 2751 PTD subjects, 576 (20.94%, 95% CI: 19.46, 22.49) developed TRD, a proportion similar to that in North American studies. TRD incidence was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.89) cases /1000 population in 2005, increased with age, and was higher in females than in males. SSRI's were the most frequently used ADs. Augmentation with antipsychotics was common. The median time from PTD onset (first AD medication) to TRD onset was 416 days but psychiatrists practicing in Taiwan indicated they would switch within <=3 months if an AD medication was not effective. We therefore repeated the analysis with a 6 months cap on time from onset of PTD to TRD. In this supplemental, post-hoc, analysis, 68 PTD subjects, 2.47%, (95% CI: 1.94, 3.10) developed TRD; i.e., 0.10 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.12) incident cases/1000 population.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectAssessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectCarbohydrate malabsorption, tryptophan (TRP) metabolism and depression were investigated.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectLogistic regression analysis was calculated to estimate effects of carbohydrate malabsorption and TRP on depression.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectFructose malabsorption was found to be associated with signs of depression.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectNo such relationship was found between lactose malabsorption and depression.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectSerum levels of TRP and TRP metabolites were no predictors of depression.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectThis prospective cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the potential association between primary-adult lactose malabsorption, fructose malabsorption, tryptophan (TRP) metabolism and the presence of depressive signs. Overall 251 patients, who were referred for lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism genotyping and fructose hydrogen/methane breath testing, were included. All participants filled out the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II). Serum concentrations of tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynuric acid (KYNA), and TRP competing amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine) were measured by high-pressure liquid-chromatography. Logistic regression analysis was performed with lactose malabsorption, fructose malabsorption and all potential biomarkers of TRP metabolism to assess the effect on signs of depression, defined as a BDI II score > 13. Primary-adult lactose malabsorption and fructose malabsorption was detected in 65 (25.90%) and 65 (25.90%) patients, respectively. Fructose malabsorption was significantly associated with BDI II score, whereas no such relationship was found for lactose malabsorption. Serum levels of TRP and TRP metabolites were no predictors of depression. The authors suggest to conduct further prospective longitudinal studies in order to get further insight of associations between carbohydrate malabsorption, biomarkers and mood disorders.Assessment of tryptophan metabolism and signs of depression in individuals with carbohydrate malabsorption - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic - ScienceDirectDepression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic - ScienceDirectDepression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic - ScienceDirectDepression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic - ScienceDirectDepression has increased significantly among demographic subgroups of current smokers.Depression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic - ScienceDirectDepression increased most prominently among young, male and high-income daily smokers.Depression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic - ScienceDirectAfter declining sharply for many years, the prevalence of smoking has remained fairly stable over the past decade.

Long-term data for 30 countries reveal that, conditional on a crash, the probability of a minor depression is 31 percent and of a major depression is 10 percent. The largest depressions are particularly likely to be accompanied by crashes. We allow for flexible timing between crashes and depressions to compute the covariance between stock-returns and an asset-pricing factor, which depends on the decline of consumption during a depression. With a coefficient of relative risk aversion around 3.5, this covariance accounts for the observed average (levered) equity premium of 7 percent.Stock-market crashes and depressions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Stock-market crashes and depressions - ScienceDirectThis paper was originally written in 2009, in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis.Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels in Mothers of Babies' Following Due to Premature Retinopathy - ScienceDirectEvaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels in Mothers of Babies' Following Due to Premature Retinopathy - ScienceDirectHigh levels of depression and anxiety among family members, especially the mother, can have a negative impact on their ability to meet the needs of children.Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels in Mothers of Babies' Following Due to Premature Retinopathy - ScienceDirectThe psychiatric follow-up, treatment, and social support provided to the mother, and regular follow-up of the baby after birth is important both for the mental health of the mother and the healthy development of the baby.Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels in Mothers of Babies' Following Due to Premature Retinopathy - ScienceDirectThere are significant increases in the survival rates of premature babies owing to rapid developments in medical technology.

All five of the personality factors were found to be at least partially related to both SOC and depression. In particular, lower neuroticism, sensation seeking and hostility, along with higher extraversion and activity, were all significantly associated with SOC. On the other hand, lower sensation seeking, extraversion and activity, and higher levels of aggression and neuroticism, were associated with higher depression scores, either directly or indirectly through SOC. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness and validity of the ZKA-PQ personality assessment measure for examining correlates of both SOC and depression.Sense of coherence as a mediator between personality and depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Social interventions: An effective approach to reduce adult depression? - ScienceDirectSocial interventions: An effective approach to reduce adult depression? - ScienceDirectSeventeen of twenty four social interventions found reductions in depression.Social interventions: An effective approach to reduce adult depression? - ScienceDirectVarious types of social interventions can be effective in reducing adult depression.Social interventions: An effective approach to reduce adult depression? - ScienceDirectSocial interventions can be tailored to diverse and resource-scarce communities.Social interventions: An effective approach to reduce adult depression? - ScienceDirectSocial interventions that aim to facilitate bonds and interaction among individuals could reduce depression at a population level; yet, the scope and effectiveness of these interventions remain unclear.

The intersectional risk for depression by race and ethnicity, and gender in the U.S. - ScienceDirectWe sought to conduct the first systematic review of studies applying an intersectional lens to assessing risk and protective factors for depression in minority adolescents in the United States. Twenty-five studies were identified which investigated the role of racial and ethnic identity and gender for minority groups and how marginalization may be associated with differential outcomes in depression symptomology. The results showed substantial variability in whether studies intentionally operationalized intersectionality through theoretical frameworks, study design, sampling, and analyses. Studies were rated on a scale of 1 through 5; those with scores of 3 or higher were included in the review. A rating of 5 indicated studies had explicitly used an intersectional theoretical framework, integrating the process of racial/ethnic identity development and gender socialization during adolescence. Three studies met the criteria for 5, one study was rated 4, and 21 studies were rated 3. Attention to experiences with discrimination was common throughout. Overall, the collective findings point to the importance of using an intersectional lens for understanding differential mechanisms for how and why specific adolescent minority youth are at greater risk for reporting depression symptoms, identifying cultural and developmental protective factors, and informing how interventions can effectively target specific mechanisms for prevention and treatment.Which girls, which boys?

Controls were included to assess DMN abnormalities specific to depression.Current sleep disturbance in older people with a lifetime history of depression is associated with increased connectivity in the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectA total of 93 adults aged 50 years and over were recruited from the Healthy Brain Ageing Clinic at the Brain and Mind Centre, Sydney, Australia. The sample comprised two groups, including 22 controls and 71 participants with a lifetime history of DSM-IV major depression (with depressive episode current or remitted). 52 of those with a lifetime history of depression also met criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Participants underwent resting-state fMRI along with comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, and medical assessment. Subjective sleep quality was assessed via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep disturbance was defined as a PSQI score > 5. A total of 68% (n = 48) of cases with a lifetime history of depression met criteria for sleep-disturbance. DMN functional connectivity was assessed via ROI-to-ROI analyses.Current sleep disturbance in older people with a lifetime history of depression is associated with increased connectivity in the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectRelative to controls, those with lifetime major depression demonstrated significantly increased functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the temporal pole. Within the depression group (n = 48), those with current sleep disturbance had significantly increased connectivity between the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and both the parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampal formation, relative to those without sleep disturbance (n = 23). These results were present after controlling for MCI diagnosis.Current sleep disturbance in older people with a lifetime history of depression is associated with increased connectivity in the Default Mode Network - ScienceDirectCurrent sleep disturbance together with depression is associated with distinct abnormalities in DMN functioning incorporating regions responsible for self-reflection and declarative memory processes. Impaired sleep is associated with increased connectivity between these regions.

The following MeSH terms were used: ghrelin AND (appetite regulation OR obesity), (sleep wake disorders OR sleep) (memory OR cognition disorders) (depression OR depressive disorder OR mood disorder).The effects of ghrelin on sleep, appetite, and memory, and its possible role in depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectGhrelin triggers appetite and alters meal patterns by making them longer and richer. This can lead to pathologies, obesity and insulin-resistance. Ghrelin seems to have a favourable effect on sleep in human beings. It tends to make sleep more efficacious and better quality. Finally, it seems to have an effect on synaptic plasticity in the zones involved in memory and it has been shown to improve memory capacity in rodents. Regarding depression, the administration of ghrelin leads to an anti-depressive effect in animals and in humans. Conversely, post anti-depressant ghrelin titrations have generally shown a decrease in ghrelin levels. Resistant patients seem to retain high levels. Finally, the seriousness of depression could be related to ghrelin levels.The effects of ghrelin on sleep, appetite, and memory, and its possible role in depression: A review of the literature - ScienceDirectGhrelin plays a probable part in depression, especially for particular endophenotypes.

However, little is known about services delivered in these countries for post-stroke depression, a common comorbidity that influences functional outcomes of stroke. In this paper, a physician from Syria reviews the literature on post-stroke depression among patients living in countries of the Middle East and North Africa region in order to examine whether current practices can be improved. Studies of prevalence were found in six of the region's countries and only four studies described interventions for stroke patients with clinical depression. The limited studies on prevalence confirmed that stroke incidence and post-stroke depression are common although diagnosed depression appears to vary depending on the economic environment of the country. Hence, additional interventions in MENA countries may be warranted to increase recognition of depression in stroke patients and to ensure health professionals are prepared to deliver appropriate services to stroke patients and their family-caregivers for depression when it occurs.Management of post-stroke depression in the Middle East and North Africa: Too little is known - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectA Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectA variety of functional assessment instruments are used in late-life depression, reflecting the complexity of this construct and the lack of standardization in the literature.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectPsychometric data regarding functional assessment instruments in late-life depression populations are very limited.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectTherefore, researchers selecting functional assessment instruments must consider a number of factors related to the aims of their study and their study population.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectRecovery of everyday premorbid function is a primary goal in the treatment of depression. Measurement of function is an important part of achieving this goal. A multitude of scales have been used to measure function in depression, reflecting the complex, multifaceted nature of functioning. Currently, however, there are no evidence-based guidelines to assist the researcher or clinician in deciding which instruments are best suited to measure function in late-life depression (LLD). Thus, the aims of this study are to 1) systematically review and identify the instrumental activities of daily living and social functioning assessment instruments used in the LLD literature; 2) identify and appraise the measurement properties of these instruments; and 3) suggest factors for LLD researchers and clinicians to consider when selecting functional assessment instruments and make pertinent recommendations.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectWe performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and CINAHL to identify studies that i) incorporated subjects aged 60 years and older with a depressive disorder, and ii) measured instrumental activities of daily living and/or social functioning.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectOur search yielded 21 functional assessment instruments. Only two of these instruments, the 36-Item Short Form Survey and the Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills, have formal validation data in LLD. Four additional instruments, although not formally validated, have relevant data regarding their measurement properties.A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Function in Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectThe primary finding of this study is that very few functional assessment instruments have been validated in LLD, and the available measurement property data are mixed; there is a need for further instrument validation in late-life depression. With this caveat in mind, we provide evidence-based suggestions for researchers and clinicians assessing functioning in LLD patients.IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectIDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectObesity and depression share a bidirectional relationship.IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectAberrant inflammation is a key factor in depression and obesity pathophysiology.IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectTRYCAT pathway may contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms in obesity.IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectTRYCAT pathway is a new drug target to treat both diseases.IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectIDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirectAssociation between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirectVitamin D has been suggested to play role in depression and DM.Association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirect5.7% (95% CI: 4.9%-6.6%) of the patients with DM were considered to have depression.Association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirectAn inversely relationship between serum 25 (OH) D levels and depression was found.Association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirectThe data suggests a possible role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of depression.Association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirectBecause of the absence of data on the direct association between vitamin D and depression in patients with diabetes, we examined the association between vitamin D state (assessed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) and the prevalence of depression in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM).Association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and depression in a large sample of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - ScienceDirectCross-sectional data were obtained from 2786 patients with T2DM recruited from a Chinese diabetes registry.

Kynurenine metabolism is hypothesized to be a key mechanism that links inflammation and depression. Inflammation activates the kynurenine pathway, leading to increases in 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) and quinolinic acid (QA), potentially neurotoxic metabolites, and decreases in kynurenic acid (KynA), a potentially neuroprotective compound. This relative neurotoxic shift in the balance of kynurenine metabolites has been associated with depression, but never been examined regarding sleep disturbance. We tested the association between sleep disturbance and this relative neurotoxic shift in 68 currently depressed, 26 previously depressed, and 66 never depressed subjects.Sleep disturbance and kynurenine metabolism in depression - ScienceDirectSleep disturbance was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Serum concentrations of kynurenine metabolites were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Putative neuroprotective indices reflecting the relative activity of neuroprotective and neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites were calculated as KynA/QA and KynA/3HK (primary outcomes).Sleep disturbance and kynurenine metabolism in depression - ScienceDirectSleep disturbance and kynurenine metabolism in depression - ScienceDirectThese data support the hypothesis that altered kynurenine metabolism may molecularly link sleep disturbance and depression.Sleep disturbance and kynurenine metabolism in depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectDriving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectMost (75%) report assessing driving with people with depression is important.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectOnly 39% of respondents routinely discuss driving with patients with major depression.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectMost (92%) report clinical reasoning is important in assessing fitness to drive.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectCognition was the client factor most influencing fitness to drive discussions.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectThe majority (83%) identify a need for further training in fitness to drive.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectAssessing the fitness to drive (FTD) of individuals with depression is important for their safety and the safety of other road users. Although medical fitness to drive (FTD) guidelines exist in Ireland little is known about how the guidelines are used in practice or how driving is addressed by health professionals.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectTo examine General Practitioners, Consultant Psychiatrists and Occupational Therapists in Ireland knowledge, attitudes and current practice related to FTD for individuals with depression.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectA cross-sectional survey employing a purposely designed questionnaire.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectSurveys were returned by 228 participants (60 Consultant Psychiatrists, 72 General Practitioners and 96 Occupational Therapists. Assessment of FTD was deemed important by 75% of respondents. Driving was routinely discussed by 39.5% of respondents. Clinical reasoning was considered important in FTD decisions by 91.6% of respondents, with an informal discussion/assessment the most common type of measurement used. Respondents identified impaired cognition, decreased concentration, medication side-effects, suicidal ideation/intent and decreased reaction time as the factors that most influence their FTD decisions. The largest percentage of Consultant Psychiatrists and Occupational Therapists felt that addressing driving would not negatively influence the therapeutic relationship while General Practitioners reported concern about impact on the therapeutic relationship. Physicians were not considered the best profession to assess FTD by a large percentage of respondents. Varying levels of confidence and competence were self-reported by all professions. All respondents reported the need for additional training. These findings require further validation as low response rates make it difficult to generalize the results.Driving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectDriving and depression: Health professional's perspectives in Ireland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectAffective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectAltered reactivity to emotional distress is assumed to play a key role in CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectHowever, general mood induction did not reveal reactivity in CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectIndividualized mood induction did reveal affective and cognitive reactivity in CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectReactivity in CD thus depends on individual relevance.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectPsychotherapeutic tools are needed that decrease reactivity to memory activation.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectChronic depression (CD) is strongly associated with childhood maltreatment, which has been proposed to lead to inefficient coping styles that are characterized by abnormal affective responsiveness and dysfunctional cognitive attitudes. However, while this notion forms an important basis for psychotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of CD, there is still little direct empirical evidence for a role of altered affective and cognitive reactivity in CD. The present study therefore experimentally investigated affective and cognitive reactivity to two forms of negative mood induction in CD patients versus a healthy control sample (HC).Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectFor the general mood induction procedure, a combination of sad pictures and sad music was used, while for individualized mood induction, negative mood was induced by individualized scripts with autobiographical content. Both experiments included n = 15 CD patients versus n = 15 HC, respectively. Interactions between affective or cognitive reactivity and group were analyzed by repeated measurements ANOVAs.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectGeneral mood induction neither revealed affective nor cognitive reactivity in the patient group while the control group reported the expected decrease of positive affect [interaction (IA) affective reactivity x group: p = .011, cognitive reactivity x group: n.s.]. In contrast, individualized mood induction specifically increased affective reactivity (IA: p = .037) as well as the amount of dysfunctional cognitions in patients versus controls (IA: p = .014).Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectThe experiments were not balanced in a crossover design, causal conclusions are thus limited. Additionally, the differences to non-chronic forms of depression are still outstanding.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectThe results suggest that in patients with CD, specific emotional activation through autobiographical memories is a key factor in dysfunctional coping styles. Psychotherapeutic interventions aimed at modifying affective and cognitive reactivity are thus of high relevance in the treatment of CD.Affective and cognitive reactivity to mood induction in chronic depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Factor Structure for the Geriatric Depression Scale in Screening Depression in Taiwanese Patients with Very Mild to Moderate Dementia - ScienceDirectTo define the factor structures of the 30 items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30) when assessing the depression in patients with very mild to moderate dementia.The Factor Structure for the Geriatric Depression Scale in Screening Depression in Taiwanese Patients with Very Mild to Moderate Dementia - ScienceDirectA total of 240 pairs of patients with very mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers who visited the memory clinic of the medical center in Taiwan from July 2001 to October 2008 were surveyed.

Those with MS and concurrent depression have poorer quality of life and are also less likely to be compliant with disease-modifying treatment, which may ultimately affect their MS disease course. Treating depression in MS with pharmacological agents can improve not only depression, but may also impact the MS disease course. However, no guidelines exist around treating depression in MS. Few randomized-controlled trials using antidepressants in MS exist. Here, we briefly review trials using antidepressant medications to treat depression in MS. We also propose individualizing treatment of depression in MS, as the depressive symptoms and MS symptoms and disease course differ significantly between patients. We explore the heterogeneity in presentation of depression through different comorbid symptoms in MS, and discuss which antidepressant options would be appropriate in each situation. We propose that future clinical trials should incorporate differences in issues between those with depression (e.g. sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence) into analysis. As MS is incredibly heterogeneous, treating concurrent depression on a case-by-case basis may enable for improving quality of life and the MS disease course.Treating depression in multiple sclerosis with antidepressants: A brief review of clinical trials and exploration of clinical symptoms to guide treatment decisions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Paternal post-partum depression: How has it been assessed?

The evaluation of depression was performed 2 weeks after ischemia. 206 patients showing no depression in 2 weeks were followed up. They were divided into late-onset PSD group and non-depressed group by clinical interview with Hamilton depression scale score 3 months after stroke. On the first day following hospitalization, the clinical data including age, gender, educational level and vascular risk factors were recorded. The severity, etiological subtype and location of stroke were evaluated. The inflammatory mediators, glucose and lipid levels were recorded on the day of admission. The association between clinical factors and late-onset PSD was explored by logistic regression analysis. The ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the predicting power of the clinical factors.Diabetes mellitus is associated with late-onset post-stroke depression - ScienceDirect187 of 206 patients completed the assessment 3 months after stroke. 19 (10.16%) patients were diagnosed as late onset PSD.

Therefore, the aim of this review was to determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of two inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) with depression in older adults. We searched five databases for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting an association between CRP or IL-6 with depression among adults sampled from the community aged 50 or older. We found 32 studies (23 cross-sectional, 7 longitudinal, and 2 assessing both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations) that met eligibility criteria. These studies were entered into a random-effects meta-analysis to determine the cross-sectional association and longitudinal direction of association between both IL-6 and CRP with depression.The association between C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6 and depression among older adults in the community: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectResults indicated a cross-sectional and longitudinal association between both CRP and IL-6 with depression in older adults, with inflammation leading to depression in longitudinal studies rather than depression to inflammation. However, there was notable heterogeneity between studies as results differed based on adjusting for confounders and on how inflammation and depression were measured. These sources of heterogeneity could explain differences in study results.The association between C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6 and depression among older adults in the community: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The association between C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6 and depression among older adults in the community: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectJoint first authors.Emerging role of amyloid beta in stress response: Implication for depression and diabetes - ScienceDirectEmerging role of amyloid beta in stress response: Implication for depression and diabetes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectImplementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectClinicians should ensure that individuals with diabetes are screened for complications and comorbidities related to depressive disorder.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectBarriers to depression screening in busy primary care clinics could be eased by incorporating a brief screening questionnaire in patient electronic health records.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectImplementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectWith an implementation of a clearly defined protocol, a majority of adult patients visiting a primary care setting could be screened efficiently for depression.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectThe study participants included a total of 378 adult patients.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectHigher prevalence of depression (52.5%) was found among diabetic patients compared with 18.3% among nondiabetic patients.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectImplementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Implementation of a Depression Screening Protocol and Tools to Improve Screening for Depression in Patients With Diabetes in the Primary Care Setting - ScienceDirectAll authors are affiliated with New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.

We explored the effect of anxiety on the outcome of acute and continuation pharmacotherapy of bipolar II depression.Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression - ScienceDirectData were derived from a randomized double-blind 12-week acute (N = 129) and 6-month continuation (N = 55) comparison of venlafaxine versus lithium monotherapy in bipolar II depression in adults. We distinguished between the items of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) that capture depression vs. anxiety (i.e., psychomotor agitation, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis, and obsessive-compulsive concerns) and examined the effect of treatment on depression and anxiety. Additionally, we explored whether baseline anxiety or depression predicted changes over time in depression and anxiety ratings or moderated treatment outcomes. We also explored whether residual depressive and anxious symptoms predicted relapse during continuation therapy.Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression - ScienceDirectVenlafaxine was superior to lithium in reducing both depression and anxiety, though its effects on anxiety were more modest than those on depression. Baseline anxiety predicted change over time in anxiety, but not depression. By contrast, baseline depression did not predict change over time in depression or anxiety. Residual anxiety, specifically uncontrollable worry, was a stronger predictor of relapse than residual depression.Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression - ScienceDirectSuccessful treatment of symptoms of anxiety in bipolar depression may protect against depressive relapse.Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression and Liver Transplant Survival - ScienceDirectPatients who underwent liver transplantation and experienced clinical depression have heretofore evinced lower survival rates when compared to nondepressed counterparts.Depression and Liver Transplant Survival - ScienceDirectTo investigate the hypothesis that transplant patients who seek and obtain medical treatment for depression would circumvent the prior reduced survival findings.Depression and Liver Transplant Survival - ScienceDirectA total of 765 patients with liver transplants were scrutinized for complications following transplantation. Further, 104 patients experienced posttransplant depression as manifested by diagnosis and treatment by medical personnel. Survival analyses were conducted comparing hazard and survival curves for these selected individuals and the remainder of transplant patients.Depression and Liver Transplant Survival - ScienceDirectContrary to prior data and consistent with the aforementioned hypothesis, median survival durations, survival curves, and hazard functions (controlling for age and prolonged posttransplant survival for the depressed patients were better.Depression and Liver Transplant Survival - ScienceDirectThe improved survival for the depressed patients may simply be related to an amelioration of depressed symptoms via antidepressant medications. However, this interpretation would only be congruent with reduced hazard, not elevated survival, beyond the norm (median) for other transplant participants. Assuming the reliability and generalization of our findings, perhaps a reasonable and compelling interpretation is that combined with the effectiveness of antidepressant medications, the seeking and receiving treatment for depression is a type of proxy measure of a more global pattern of adherence to recommended posttransplant medical regimens.Depression and Liver Transplant Survival - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prevalence and predictors of depression and well-being after hysterectomy: An observational study - ScienceDirectTo assess risk and predictive factors for depression and well-being, 3 and 12 months after elective hysterectomy.

However, it remains unclear whether reported neurocognitive abnormalities could objectively identify an individual as having schizophrenia or MDD.Convergence and divergence of neurocognitive patterns in schizophrenia and depression - ScienceDirectThe current study included 220 first-episode patients with schizophrenia, 110 patients with MDD and 240 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). All participants performed the short version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China; the immediate and delayed logical memory of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised in China; and seven tests from the computerized Cambridge Neurocognitive Test Automated Battery to evaluate neurocognitive performance. The three-class AdaBoost tree-based ensemble algorithm was employed to identify neurocognitive endophenotypes that may distinguish between subjects in the categories of schizophrenia, depression and HC. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to further explore the neurocognitive patterns in each group.Convergence and divergence of neurocognitive patterns in schizophrenia and depression - ScienceDirectThe AdaBoost algorithm identified individual's diagnostic class with an average accuracy of 77.73% (80.81% for schizophrenia, 53.49% for depression and 86.21% for HC). The average area under ROC curve was 0.92 (0.96 in schizophrenia, 0.86 in depression and 0.92 in HC). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed for MDD and schizophrenia, convergent altered neurocognition patterns related to shifting, sustained attention, planning, working memory and visual memory. Divergent neurocognition patterns for MDD and schizophrenia related to motor speed, general intelligence, perceptual sensitivity and reversal learning were identified.Convergence and divergence of neurocognitive patterns in schizophrenia and depression - ScienceDirectNeurocognitive abnormalities could predict whether the individual has schizophrenia, depression or neither with relatively high accuracy. Additionally, the neurocognitive features showed promise as endophenotypes for discriminating between schizophrenia and depression.Convergence and divergence of neurocognitive patterns in schizophrenia and depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Kangaroo care and postpartum depression: The role of oxytocin - ScienceDirectKangaroo care and postpartum depression: The role of oxytocin - ScienceDirectThe aim of this review was to gather the evidence linking the effects of kangaroo care with postpartum depression, specifically focusing on the proposed underlying mechanism involving the release of oxytocin.Kangaroo care and postpartum depression: The role of oxytocin - ScienceDirectThe literature review was conducted by targeting PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases. The search terms used were postpartum depression, postnatal depression, oxytocin, oxytocin hormone, postpartum depression, kangaroo care, and skin-to-skin contact.Kangaroo care and postpartum depression: The role of oxytocin - ScienceDirectKangaroo care was found to play an important role in decreasing the risk for postpartum depression. Skin-to-skin contact during kangaroo care was found to trigger the release of oxytocin, which is hypothesized to minimize the risk for depressive symptoms as well as decrease maternal stress. The oxytocinergic system regulates the release of oxytocin, which is an effect that is opposite that which occurs with the human stress response, in which the sympathetic nervous system is activated to release catecholamines in response to harmful or threatening stimuli. The oxytocinergic system regulates calmness, connection, and socialization processes. During kangaroo care, oxytocin blocks the stress response and decreases the circulation of catecholamines, yielding positive outcomes that include maternal stress reduction and prevention of postpartum depression.Kangaroo care and postpartum depression: The role of oxytocin - ScienceDirectKangaroo care can be used as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent or decrease the risk of postpartum depression.Kangaroo care and postpartum depression: The role of oxytocin - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Nursing Association.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectSelf-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectAssessed depression-related self-perceived personality traits longitudinally in individuals with SAD.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectIn individuals with SAD, depression severity is associated with higher scores on Neuroticism in remitted phase.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectNeuroticism and Extraversion fluctuate with season in SAD, but remain stable across seasons in controls.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectNeuroticism may represent a vulnerability marker related to SAD.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectDuring depression Neuroticism and Extraversion may be sensitive markers of SAD pathology.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectThe personality traits Neuroticism and Extraversion may be involved in the development of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). However, the impact of personality traits on SAD severity and whether such self-reported traits fluctuate with season is unknown. We investigated the association between Neuroticism, as acquired in a symptom-free phase and depression severity in individuals with SAD and seasonal changes in personality traits in individuals with SAD compared to healthy controls. Twenty-nine individuals diagnosed with SAD and thirty demographically matched controls completed the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised and the Major Depression Inventory twice: in summer when individuals with SAD were symptom-free, and in winter when they experienced SAD symptoms. In summer, the groups scored similarly on their personality traits, and the controls did not score any different in winter compared to summer. High scores on Neuroticism in summer was associated with more severe depressive symptoms in winter in SAD individuals. In winter, individuals with SAD scored higher on Neuroticism and lower on Extraversion, both compared to controls and to their own summer scores. Our results support that Neuroticism may represent a vulnerability marker related to SAD, and during a depressive episode Neuroticism and Extraversion may be sensitive markers of SAD pathology.Self-perceived personality characteristics in seasonal affective disorder and their implications for severity of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2000 to 2017 - ScienceDirectPrevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2000 to 2017 - ScienceDirectThe prevalence of depression among cardiovascular patients in Iran is higher than the figures found in developed countries.Prevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2000 to 2017 - ScienceDirectPrevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2000 to 2017 - ScienceDirectWomen are more at risk for depression than men.Prevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2000 to 2017 - ScienceDirectIn both developed and developing countries, cardiovascular disease is on the rise, representing nowadays one of the main challenges for the health systems worldwide.

It is unclear whether these comorbidities represent two correlated but distinct disorders or a common post-event response. We sought to inform this question by examining the distinctiveness of PTSD and depression symptoms at four cross-sectional time points, using data from a parent prospective longitudinal study of 858 Marines evaluated before deployment and approximately 1, 5, and 8 months after returning from the Afghanistan war. We conducted a series of cross-sectional confirmatory factor analyses of PTSD and depression symptoms at each time point, using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist IV and the Beck Depression Inventory II. Analyses indicated that across all four assessments, self-reported symptoms on the measures were best explained by distinct but correlated subclusters of symptoms within each measure. This structure was supported by the data both before and after deployment, even with increases in average PTSD symptoms after deployment. These findings suggest that despite shared method variance and some symptom overlap, self-reports of PTSD and depression symptoms across a stressful combat deployment show distinct symptom subclusters rather than a general common trauma reaction in this sample of Marines.The structure of co-occurring PTSD and depression symptoms in a cohort of Marines pre- and post-deployment - ScienceDirectThis study was funded by VA Health Service Research and Development (SDR 09-0128) and by the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.

OSPI-Europe is a multi-level suicide prevention programme including a public awareness campaign. It was implemented in four regions of four European countries (Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal). This paper reports the results of the evaluation of the campaign, including its visibility and effects of the campaign on stigma associated with depression and help-seeking behaviour.Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking: Impact of the OSPI-Europe depression awareness campaign in four European regions - ScienceDirectA representative general population survey (N=4004) including measures on personal stigma, perceived stigma, openness to help, perceived value of help, and socio-demographic variables was conducted in the four intervention and four control regions in a cross-sectional pre-post design.Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking: Impact of the OSPI-Europe depression awareness campaign in four European regions - ScienceDirectThe public awareness campaign was considerably more visible in Germany and Portugal compared to Ireland and Hungary. Visibility was further affected by age and years of schooling. Personal stigma, perceived stigma and openness toward professional help varied significantly across the four countries. Respondents in the intervention regions showed significantly less personal depression stigma than respondents in the control regions after the campaign. Respondents of the intervention region who were aware of the campaign reported more openness toward seeking professional help than respondents who were unaware of it.Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking: Impact of the OSPI-Europe depression awareness campaign in four European regions - ScienceDirectThe OSPI-Europe awareness campaign was visible and produced some positive results. At the same time, it proved to be difficult to show strong, measurable and unambiguous effects, which is in line with previous studies. Public awareness campaigns as conducted within OSPI-Europe can contribute to improved attitudes and knowledge about depression in the general public and produce synergistic effects, in particular when the dissemination of awareness campaign materials is simultaneously reinforced by other intervention levels of a multi-level intervention programme.Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking: Impact of the OSPI-Europe depression awareness campaign in four European regions - ScienceDirectThe survey was cross-sectional and based on self-report, so no causal inferences could be drawn.Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking: Impact of the OSPI-Europe depression awareness campaign in four European regions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectSuicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectIn a cross-sectional analysis, we had previously found that suicidal ideation is most closely associated with subjective, rather than neurovegetative symptoms of major depression.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectIn this clinical trial, in a separate sample of patients at elevated risk for suicidal behavior, treatment-related declines in these subjective symptoms were most closely associated with reductions in suicidal ideation, confirming and extending our earlier findings.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectSubjective rather than neurovegetative symptoms of major depression, then, appear to be the most appropriate target for treatment of patients with elevated suicidal ideation.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectSuicidal ideation appears to be more strongly associated with subjective rather than neurovegetative symptoms of depression. Effective treatment, then, should produce reductions in suicidal ideation to the degree that these subjective symptoms are alleviated relative to treatment effects on other symptoms.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectIn a randomized clinical trial comparing paroxetine and bupropion for treatment of depression in patients with either suicidal ideation or past attempt, depression severity and suicidal ideation were assessed weekly during the 8-week study. Depression rating scales - the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS] and the Beck Depression Scale [BDI] - were decomposed into symptom clusters based on our published factor analyses, and their change over time compared to changes on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation [SSI].Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectImprovement in factor scores associated with subjective symptoms of depression - HDRS Psychic Depression, BDI Subjective Depression, and BDI Self-Blame - were the best predictors of declining scores on the SSI regardless of type of drug treatment. BDI Subjective Depression was the best single predictor in the context of all other significant univariate predictors, accounting for 31.4% of the variance in the change in SSI. The three factors together accounted for 35.3%.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectThis is a secondary analysis of clinical trial data, with fixed treatments.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectEffective treatments to reduce suicidal ideation are associated with the reduction of the subjective symptoms of depression, which may not always decline in synchrony with improvement in neurovegetative symptoms. This asynchrony may result in a period of elevated risk after the initiation of therapy. Data indicate that subjective depression symptoms should be a primary target in the treatment of depressed suicidal patients.Suicidal ideation declines with improvement in the subjective symptoms of major depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectMaternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectA longitudinal study of 249 postpartum women, with depression screening four times over an 18 month period.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectTwo peaks of depression-onset: two-weeks and 18 months after delivery.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectBoth time periods also significant for increased symptomology across the study sample.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectOne of the first studies to identify a later depression peak, at the entry into toddlerhood.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectLittle is known about the onset of depression beyond the first postpartum year. This study examines the onset and course of depression over an 18 month period among a socio-economically diverse, community-wide sample of women.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectA prospective longitudinal telephone survey of 249 women was conducted at two weeks, two months, six months and 18 months after delivery. Depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and onset was defined as the first EPDS score of 12+ on the 30-point scale.

They appear to be the result of two processes: (1) elevated depression symptoms at two-weeks and again at 18 months postpartum experienced by the full sample and, thus, they may be a normal trend, and (2) onset of major depression by two sub-groups of women, one at each time period. Therefore, continued screening after one-year post delivery is indicated.Maternal depression is not just a problem early on - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectWhen knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectDiabetes patients with sufficient health literacy tend to manage better their disease.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectDiabetes patients with higher self-efficacy tend to manage better their disease.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectBoth, depression and diabetes-related distress reduce the positive impact of health literacy on diabetes self-management.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectAdequate self-management activities are important predictors of diabetes outcomes. As diabetes literacy and self-efficacy are strong predictors of diabetes self-care, self-management education programs focus essentially on these factors. This study investigated whether emotional distress or depression moderates the relation between health literacy, self-efficacy and diabetes self-care behaviors.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirect128 people with type 2 diabetes were recruited in hospitals, through general practitioners and via a diabetes website, and completed a questionnaire assessing health literacy, self-efficacy, diabetes-related distress, depression and self-care behaviors.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectMultiple regression analysis confirms that health literacy and self-efficacy significantly predict reported self-care behaviors. Additional regression analyses reveal that distress or depression do not predict self-care behaviors directly, but moderate the effect of health literacy, which has a weaker impact in patients experiencing distress or depression. In contrast, distress and depression do not moderate the effect of self-efficacy on diabetes self-care behaviors.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectEmotional distress, whether related to diabetes or not, prevents patients from acting on their competence to perform adequate self-management behaviors.When knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectWhen knowing is not enough: Emotional distress and depression reduce the positive effects of health literacy on diabetes self-management - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectTreadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectPrenatal buprenorphine exposure induces depression-like behavior in weanlings.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectTreadmill exercise improves depression-like phenotypes.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectTreadmill exercise increases expression of neurotrophins and neurotransmitters.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectTreadmill exercise decreases oxidative stress and inflammation.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectMounting evidence suggests that physical exercise shows health benefits in a range of diseases, including psychiatric disorders. Perinatal opioid exposure produces neurobehavioral abnormality, which includes depression symptoms, in patients and their offspring following chronic use of buprenorphine, a mixed agonist/antagonist with a high affinity to opioid receptors, for pain control. Previously, we demonstrated that prenatal buprenorphine exposure in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats starting from gestation day 7 and lasting for 14 days caused the development of depression-like phenotypes in pups at postnatal day 21. Using the same prenatal buprenorphine exposure model, we further demonstrated that a 4-week course of moderate treadmill exercise conducted on pups starting from postnatal day 22 improved depression-like neurobehaviors. Prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced neurobehavioral changes were accompanied by reductions of neuronal survival, neural stem cell-associated genes, plasma level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin, phosphorylated tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B (TrkB), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), PKA activity, phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and CREB DNA binding activity, as well as elevation of repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Those changes in parameters of plasma and brain were improved by treadmill exercise. In conclusion, the findings of the current study suggest that a non-pharmacological option, i.e., moderate treadmill exercise, alleviated the development of depression-like neurobehaviors by resolving the oxidative and inflammatory burden as well as by enhancing neurochemical and neuroendocrine signaling.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Treadmill exercise alleviated prenatal buprenorphine exposure-induced depression in rats - ScienceDirectChih-Cheng Wu and Chih-Jen Hung contributed equally in this study.Voluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectVoluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectPostpartum CORT (corticosterone) reduced maternal care and hippocampal neurogenesis.Voluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectPostpartum fluoxetine (FLX) prevented CORT-induced reductions in maternal care.Voluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectExercise, but not FLX, reduced CORT-induced maternal depressive-like behavior.Voluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectFLX increased neurogenesis in dams only in combination with exercise.Voluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectVoluntary running influences the efficacy of fluoxetine in a model of postpartum depression - ScienceDirectPresent Address: University at Albany, State University of New York, Department of Psychology, 1400 Washington Ave., Albany, NY 12222.Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action - ScienceDirectSaffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action - ScienceDirectDepression and anxiety impose high economic and social costs.Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action - ScienceDirectClinical findings have shown that saffron and its active constituents possess antidepressant properties.Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action - ScienceDirectAntidepressant efficacy of saffron and crocin is comparable to those of standard drugs.Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action - ScienceDirectThis review provides updates on the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of saffron and its mechanisms of action.Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action - ScienceDirectDepression and anxiety are two common mental health problems with high economic and social costs.

Over-reaction of these systems to stressful environmental situations makes people vulnerable to depression and suicide. This is the first postmortem study on changes in a relatively novel stress system in depression, consisting of the hypothalamic hypocretin neurons and hypocretin receptors in the prefrontal cortex. A clear sex-related change was found in the hypothalamic hypocretin-1-immunoreactivity in depression. Evaluation of the hypocretin system in a frequently used depression animal model, i.e. chronic unpredictable mild stress rats, did not replicate changes found in the hypocretin systems in the human brain in depression.Sexually Dimorphic Changes of Hypocretin (Orexin) in Depression - ScienceDirectNeurophysiological and behavioral processes regulated by hypocretin (orexin) are severely affected in depression. However, alterations in hypocretin have so far not been studied in the human brain. We explored the hypocretin system changes in the hypothalamus and cortex in depression from male and female subjects.Sexually Dimorphic Changes of Hypocretin (Orexin) in Depression - ScienceDirectWe quantified the differences between depression patients and well-matched controls, in terms of hypothalamic hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity (ir) and hypocretin receptors (Hcrtr-receptors)-mRNA in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, we determined the alterations in the hypocretin system in a frequently used model for depression, the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat.Sexually Dimorphic Changes of Hypocretin (Orexin) in Depression - ScienceDirecti) Compared to control subjects, the amount of hypocretin-immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in female but not in male depression patients; ii) hypothalamic hypocretin-ir showed a clear diurnal fluctuation, which was absent in depression; iii) male depressive patients who had committed suicide showed significantly increased ACC Hcrt-receptor-2-mRNA expression compared to male controls; and iv) female but not male CUMS rats showed a highly significant positive correlation between the mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone and prepro-hypocretin in the hypothalamus, and a significantly increased Hcrt-receptor-1-mRNA expression in the frontal cortex compared to female control rats.Sexually Dimorphic Changes of Hypocretin (Orexin) in Depression - ScienceDirectThe clear sex-related change found in the hypothalamic hypocretin-1-ir in depression should be taken into account in the development of hypocretin-targeted therapeutic strategies.Dietary intake of fish and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risks of perinatal depression: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectThe results of several epidemiological studies and clinical trials investigating the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on antenatal and postnatal depression remain controversial. We investigated the possible association of dietary intake of fish and n-3 PUFAs with the risks of maternal and paternal psychological distress during pregnancy and of maternal postpartum depression in Japan. From a dataset comprising 104,102 maternal registrations and 52,426 paternal registrations in The Japan Environment and Children's Study, this study analyzed complete data on questionnaires for 75,139, 79,346, and 77,661 women during early pregnancy, mid-late pregnancy, and after pregnancy, respectively, and for 41,506 male partners. Multivariable logistic regression showed reduced risk of psychological distress in the second and third quintiles for fish intake in early pregnancy and in the second to fifth quintile in mid-late pregnancy. No reductions were observed for n-3 PUFA intake in early pregnancy but in the second to fourth quintile in mid-late pregnancy. For postpartum depression, reductions were observed in the second to fourth quintile for fish intake but only in the first quintile for n-3 PUFA intake. As for paternal psychological distress, only the fourth quintile for fish intake showed a significant reduced risk but none were shown for n-3 PUFA intake. In conclusion, fish intake was associated with some reduced risk of psychological distress during pregnancy, even for male partners. The associations were weaker for n-3 PUFA intake than for fish intake.Dietary intake of fish and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risks of perinatal depression: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectStudy Group members are listed in the Appendix.Depression and insomnia as mediators of the relationship between distress and quality of life in cancer patients - ScienceDirectDepression and insomnia as mediators of the relationship between distress and quality of life in cancer patients - ScienceDirectDepression and insomnia mediated the relationship between distress and QOL.Depression and insomnia as mediators of the relationship between distress and quality of life in cancer patients - ScienceDirectDepression exerted the largest direct and indirect negative effects on QOL.Depression and insomnia as mediators of the relationship between distress and quality of life in cancer patients - ScienceDirectGreater increases in insomnia were associated with increased depression.Depression and insomnia as mediators of the relationship between distress and quality of life in cancer patients - ScienceDirectDistress in cancer patients leads to poorer quality of life (QOL) and negatively impacts survival.

Aim of this article is to analyze all studies which investigated the effects of untreated perinatal paternal depression in offspring. We searched pertinent, peer-reviewed articles published in English (January 1980 to April 2016) on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Science.gov. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the reviewed studies suffer from methodological limitations, including the small sample, the lack of a structured psychiatric diagnosis, and inclusion bias. Despite such limitations, paternal depression seems to be associated with an increased risk of developmental and behavioural problems and even psychiatric disorders in offspring. In particular, in infants and toddlers such problems vary from increased crying to hyperactivity and conduct problems to psychological and developmental impairment, and poor social outcomes. School-age children of depressed fathers have a doubled risk for suffering from specific psychiatric disorders. Hence, facilitating access to vigorous and evidence based treatments is a public health opportunity for improving the quality of life of depressed parents and their children. Evidences emerging from this review actually suggest that the traditional gender-focused approach to perinatal mood disorders should be completed by a family-centred approach, in order to improve the effectiveness of perinatal mental health programs.Untreated perinatal paternal depression: Effects on offspring - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Opioids, Respiratory Depression and Sleep-Disordered Breathing - ScienceDirectThe increasing use of opioid in the perioperative period has increased the opioid associated morbidity and mortality. There is a well-established connection between the opioids, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and respiratory depression. The treatment of postoperative pain with opioids in SDB patients may result in respiratory depression. In an unmonitored setting, it may lead to life-threatening respiratory events. More studies are required to evaluate the effective management and prevention of respiratory depression in SDB patients.

Glycosides are naturally-occurring plant secondary metabolites with significant medicinal potential and clinical scope as antidepressant. The aim of this review is to focus on the antidepressant effects of glycosides in preclinical studies, with an emphasis on the possible mechanisms. The literature search revealed that only a few phytoglycosides have been evaluated for their relevance in depression alleviation. Through preclinical tests, it has come forth that the efficacy is mediated by the modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDFN) in the hippocampus, that is known for promoting synaptic efficacy, neuronal connectivity and neuroplasticity. Thus, attempting the upregulation of BDNF expression by plant glycosides can be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of depression. The outcome of this review can stimulate neuroscientists to evaluate plant-derived glycosides for the treatment of depression, as these structurally-complex and diverse molecules, might usher in a new paradigm in the treatment of depression, with a better efficacy and tolerability.Targeting BDNF modulation by plant glycosides as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (170KB)Download full-size imageTargeting BDNF modulation by plant glycosides as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Barriers to antenatal psychosocial assessment and depression screening in private hospital settings - ScienceDirectThe evidence of benefit for antenatal psychosocial assessment and depression screening has been sufficient to lead the implementation of screening in public hospitals in all states of Australia.

Extant literature has yet to examine hostile interpretation bias in clinically depressed samples; the current studies sought to fill this gap.Hostile interpretation bias in depression - ScienceDirectStudy 1 participants included undergraduates who met criteria for MDD (n=36) or no anxiety or mood diagnosis (n=35). Each participant completed a structured clinical interview along with measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait hostility. In Study 2, a sample of treatment-seeking individuals with elevated trait anger completed measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait anger.Hostile interpretation bias in depression - ScienceDirectStudy 1 demonstrated that, relative to the non-depressed group, individuals with depression displayed greater hostile interpretation bias but comparable levels of trait hostility. In Study 2, greater hostile interpretation bias was associated with greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was independent of co-occurring trait anger.Hostile interpretation bias in depression - ScienceDirectThe correlational nature of these studies precludes interpretation of causal relationships between constructs. Additionally, replication of these results should be sought in a larger, more diverse sample.Hostile interpretation bias in depression - ScienceDirectOverall, the findings suggest hostile interpretation bias may play a unique role in depression and could be a treatable feature of interpersonal mechanisms maintaining MDD.Hostile interpretation bias in depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Risk of depression enhances auditory Pitch discrimination in the brain as indexed by the mismatch negativity - ScienceDirectRisk of depression enhances auditory Pitch discrimination in the brain as indexed by the mismatch negativity - ScienceDirectMismatch negativity amplitudes (MMNs) to slide and pitch deviants are enhanced in individuals with risk of depression.Risk of depression enhances auditory Pitch discrimination in the brain as indexed by the mismatch negativity - ScienceDirectMMN to pitch is larger for deviants in a musical major mode context than minor one.Risk of depression enhances auditory Pitch discrimination in the brain as indexed by the mismatch negativity - ScienceDirectThe relation between MMNs to pitch deviants and depression level is influenced by musicianship.Risk of depression enhances auditory Pitch discrimination in the brain as indexed by the mismatch negativity - ScienceDirectDepression is a state of aversion to activity and low mood that affects behaviour, thoughts, feelings and sense of well-being.

They were enrolled in either the MBCT intervention group (n=14) or the treatment-as-usual control group (n=16), and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months following baseline.Feasibility of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Group Intervention as an Adjunctive Treatment for Postpartum Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectMultivariate analyses demonstrated that depression and anxiety levels decreased, and mindfulness levels increased, in the MBCT group, but not in the control group. Many of the between-group and over time comparisons displayed trends towards significance, although these differences were not always statistically significant. Additionally, the effect sizes for anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were frequently large, indicating that the MBCT intervention may have had a clinically significant effect on participants.Feasibility of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Group Intervention as an Adjunctive Treatment for Postpartum Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectLimitations include small sample size and the non-equivalent control group design.Feasibility of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Group Intervention as an Adjunctive Treatment for Postpartum Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectWe demonstrated that MBCT has potential as an adjunctive, non-pharmacological treatment for postpartum depression/anxiety that does not wholly remit with pharmacotherapy.

Using the biopsychosocial model, we sought to determine whether variations in depression contribute to racial group differences in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis pain between Asian Americans and non-Hispanic white Americans. The sample consisted of 100 participants, including 50 Asian Americans (28 Korean Americans, 9 Chinese Americans, 7 Japanese Americans, 5 Filipino Americans, and 1 Indian American) and 50 age- and sex-matched non-Hispanic white Americans with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis pain. The Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to assess symptoms of depression, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale were used to measure clinical pain. In addition, quantitative sensory testing was used to measure experimental sensitivity to heat- and mechanically-induced pain. The results indicated that higher levels of depression in Asian Americans may contribute to greater clinical pain and experimental pain sensitivity. These findings add to the growing literature regarding ethnic and racial differences in pain and its associated psychological conditions, and additional research is warranted to strengthen these findings.Depression and Pain in Asian and White Americans With Knee Osteoarthritis - ScienceDirectThis article shows the contribution of depression to clinical pain and experimental pain sensitivity in Asian Americans with knee osteoarthritis. Our results suggest that Asian Americans have higher levels of depressive symptoms and that depression plays a relevant role in greater clinical pain and experimental pain sensitivity in Asian Americans.Depression and Pain in Asian and White Americans With Knee Osteoarthritis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression and Pain in Asian and White Americans With Knee Osteoarthritis - ScienceDirectThis study was funded by the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute Clinical Research Pilot Project Award, supported in part by the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences Clinical and Translational Science Award to the University of Florida (UL1 TR000064) and by National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging grants R37AG033906 and K07AG046371.

However, not all depressed patients show impairments in these domains. The aim of this study was to examine whether different kinds of childhood adversity might account for cognitive deficits in patients with major depression.Childhood adversity and cognitive functioning in patients with major depression - ScienceDirectNinety-one patients with major depression (DSM-IV) and 40 healthy controls completed a neuropsychological test battery assessing memory, processing speed and executive functions. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to measure the severity and number of incidences of sexual, physical and emotional abuse and physical and emotional neglect.Childhood adversity and cognitive functioning in patients with major depression - ScienceDirectPatients with major depression had a significantly higher number of traumas and reported more severe emotional abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect than healthy controls. Patients performed less well in memory tasks, general knowledge and processing speed than healthy controls. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the overall number of traumas was significantly associated with poorer general knowledge, lower processing speed and impaired executive functions in patients with major depression. A second model including all CTQ-subscales simultaneously demonstrated an association between physical neglect and poorer verbal learning, and physical abuse and diminished executive functions.Childhood adversity and cognitive functioning in patients with major depression - ScienceDirectA higher number of childhood adversities may influence general knowledge, processing speed and executive functions in patients with major depression. In addition, physical abuse and neglect seemed to be associated with verbal learning deficits and poorer executive functions.Childhood adversity and cognitive functioning in patients with major depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectLet it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectParticipants had to solve as many anagrams as possible in a limited period of time.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectDepressive inpatients spent less time on unsolvable anagrams than a control group.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectWe controlled for group differences in the time spent on solvable anagrams.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectWe conclude that depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectOur findings provide evidence that depression might serve an adaptive function.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectPrevious studies have demonstrated that clinging to unattainable goals is linked to the onset of depression. The present study investigated whether symptoms of a clinical depression are adaptive in that they facilitate disengagement from unattainable goals.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectLet it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectIn line with our hypothesis, depressive inpatients spent less time on unsolvable anagrams. There was no group difference in the time needed to solve the solvable anagrams.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectOur study tested disengagement from anagram tasks in the lab in a sample of depressive inpatients and thus may not be representative for contexts of disengagement from personal goals outside the lab or for people with milder or briefer forms of depression. Follow-up questions thus concern the development of goal disengagement processes in everyday life during the course of a major depressive episode.Let it go: Depression facilitates disengagement from unattainable goals - ScienceDirectOur findings provide evidence for the view that clinical depression, although pathological, might also serve an adaptive function.

Lewinsohn's cognitive behavioural model of depression assumes a lack of positive experience due to a reduced level of activity as a key aspect of depression. The acute relationship between motor activity and mood as well as between motor activity and incentive drive (the motivation to engage in activities) is unknown. An augmentation of mood and incentive drive could precede or follow motor activity. We examined (1) whether motor activity would be correlated with the course of depression and (2) the temporal relationship between motor activity and acute changes in mood and incentive drive.Walking away from depression-motor activity increases ratings of mood and incentive drive in patients with major depression - ScienceDirectMotor activity was measured with actigraphy in 12 patients with depression for one week. Severity of depression was assessed before and at the end of the study with depression rating scales. The patients reported mood and incentive drive once per hour. With lag sequential analysis, the temporal relationship between motor activity and mood and incentive drive was evaluated. Higher motor activity was associated with depression improvement. Motor activity had an acute association with mood and incentive drive, especially one hour after activity. The results support the Lewinsohn's model of depression and underline the impact of behavioural activation in antidepressant treatment.Walking away from depression-motor activity increases ratings of mood and incentive drive in patients with major depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Expectations and forecasting during the Great Depression: Real-time evidence from the business press - ScienceDirectExpectations and forecasting during the Great Depression: Real-time evidence from the business press - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Expectations and forecasting during the Great Depression: Real-time evidence from the business press - ScienceDirectThis paper was written when this author was visiting George Washington University's Forecasting Group and Economics Department.

Is it more common or chronic or difficult to treat? Is depression in late life more likely to be attributed to psychological problems? Twenty-years ago, Dan Blazer, a pioneer known for his groundbreaking work on depression in older adulthood, conducted an important review of the existing literature to refute five commonly held beliefs about depression in late life. Now, two decades later, we call upon selected articles that are representative of our current knowledge to provide an update and identify research priorities. The research consensus spanning the past 20 years suggests that when compared with their younger counterparts, depression in older adults is not more common and is not more often caused by psychological factors. Although some studies have suggested that depression in late life may be symptomatically different and characterized by a more somatic presentation, there is insufficient empirical evidence to conclude that depression presents differently across adulthood. Overall, older adults respond to psychological interventions as well as younger adults, although evidence suggests that antidepressants are less efficacious in late life. Finally, compared with middle-aged adults, depression in older adults is associated with a more chronic course (i.e., higher rate of relapse), which is likely moderated by medical comorbidity. This special article summarizes our current understanding of the nature and treatment of late-life depression and highlights areas of inquiry in need of further study.Increased estrogen level can be associated with depression in males - ScienceDirectIncreased estrogen level can be associated with depression in males - ScienceDirectOverweight and obesity was associated with decreased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, and total testosterone in men.Increased estrogen level can be associated with depression in males - ScienceDirectIncreased estrogen level can be associated with depression in males - ScienceDirectIncreased estrogen level was associated with depressive symptomatology regardless of BMI in younger men.Increased estrogen level can be associated with depression in males - ScienceDirectSeveral studies have shown a positive association between depression and obesity; however the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

However, a direct link has not been established between post-stroke depression and functional recovery and balance.Depression and dynamic balance recovery among stroke survivors: A preliminary investigation - ScienceDirectThe aim of this preliminary investigation was to investigate the occurrences of depression and to assess dynamic balance recovery status of stroke survivors as a foundational study for to a future large investigation to establish the relationship between depression and dynamic balance recovery.Depression and dynamic balance recovery among stroke survivors: A preliminary investigation - ScienceDirectA convenient sample of 18 stroke survivors was recruited from stroke patients attending the outpatient adult neurology unit of the Physiotherapy Department, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in a cross-sectional design. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Dynamic Gait Index / Functional Gait Assessment score were used to collect data for depression and dynamic balance recovery respectively. Associations between depression and dynamic balance recovery were determined using Chi-Square analysis at a confidence level of 95%. Analysis was done using SPSS v. 20.Depression and dynamic balance recovery among stroke survivors: A preliminary investigation - ScienceDirectResult showed a high prevalence (55.60%) of post-stroke depression among stroke survivors.

People who exhibit high stress underestimation might not be interested in information on mental health, and would therefore have less knowledge of it. We investigated the association between stress underestimation tendency and mental health literacy of depression (i.e., knowledge of the recognition, prognosis, and usefulness of resources of depression) in Japanese workers. We cross-sectionally surveyed 3718 Japanese workers using a web-based questionnaire on stress underestimation, mental health literacy of depression (vignettes on people with depression), and covariates (age, education, depressive symptoms, income, and worksite size). After adjusting for covariates, high stress underestimation was associated with greater odds of not recognizing depression (i.e., choosing anything other than depression). Furthermore, these individuals had greater odds of expecting the case to improve without treatment and not selecting useful sources of support (e.g. talk over with friends/family, see a psychiatrist, take medication, see a counselor) compared to those with moderate stress underestimation. These relationships were all stronger among males than among females. Stress underestimation was related to poorer mental health literacy of depression.Stress underestimation and mental health literacy of depression in Japanese workers: A cross-sectional study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Nicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectNicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectNicotine improves cognitive performance in clinical and preclinical studies.Nicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectNicotine may also benefit depressive symptoms and depressive behavior.Nicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectCognitive and mood benefits may be mediated by nicotinic effect on neural networks.Nicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectNicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectImprovement to mood and cognition may particularly benefit older depressed adults.Nicotine and networks: Potential for enhancement of mood and cognition in late-life depression - ScienceDirectLate-life depression is characterized by both lower mood and poor cognitive performance, symptoms that often do not fully respond to current antidepressant medications. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists such as nicotine may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for this population. Both preclinical and preliminary clinical studies suggest that nAChR agonists can improve depressive behavior in animal models and improve mood in depressed individuals. Substantial literature also supports that nAChR agonists benefit cognitive performance, particularly in older populations. These potential benefits may be mediated by the effects of nAChR stimulation on neural network function and connectivity. Functional neuroimaging studies detail effects of nAChR agonists on the default mode network, central-executive network, and salience network that may oppose or reverse network changes seen in depression. We propose that, given the existent literature and the clinical presentation of late-life depression, nicotine or other nAChR agonists may have unique therapeutic benefits in this population and that clinical trials examining nicotine effects on mood, cognition, and network dynamics in late-life depression are justified.Predictive value of depression and anxiety for long-term mortality: differences in outcome between acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris - ScienceDirectSince the early 2000s the treatment of choice for an acute myocardial infarction has moved from thrombolytic therapy to primary PCI (pPCI). As a result, the majority of patients undergoing PCI shifted from stable angina pectoris (SA) to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Additionally the previously observed association between depression and anxiety and long-term outcome in patients who underwent a PCI may have been changed. The main objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of depression and anxiety for 10-year mortality, in a cohort with post-PCI patients treated for SA versus patients treated for ACS.Predictive value of depression and anxiety for long-term mortality: differences in outcome between acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris - ScienceDirectPredictive value of depression and anxiety for long-term mortality: differences in outcome between acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris - ScienceDirectPredictive value of depression and anxiety for long-term mortality: differences in outcome between acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris - ScienceDirectAnxiety at baseline was associated with an increased 10-year mortality rate after PCI. Depression was also associated with higher 10-year mortality, however the association disappeared after additional adjustment for anxiety. This finding was more pronounced in patients presenting with SA as compared to those presenting with ACS, which might be a result of the increasing number of ACS patients treated with pPCI.Prenatal and early postnatal depression and child maltreatment among Japanese fathers - ScienceDirectPrenatal and early postnatal depression and child maltreatment among Japanese fathers - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLong-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectResearch into the long-term effects of exercise intensity on depression is scarce.Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLight, moderate and vigorous exercise was compared to treatment as usual (TAU).Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLong-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLight and vigorous exercise resulted in lower depression severity than moderate exercise.Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectLong-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectTrial registration: The study was registered with the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS study ID: DRKS00008745).Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAddress: Department of Public Health Sciences (PHS), K9, Public Health Epidemiology, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial - ScienceDirectAddress: Box 5626, 114 86 Stockholm, Sweden.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectDisentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectDepression had both immediate and long-term impacts on sleep problems.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectThe timing of depression was important for females.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectFluctuating effects of depression were more pronounced during adulthood in females.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectInterventions for sleep problems need to incorporate depression factors.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectTimely recognition and treatment of depression are especially important for females.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectLittle is known about the differential influences of between- and within-person effects of depression as well as its long-term impacts on sleep problems in adolescents. This study aims to disentangle these differences by estimating three effects of depression (i.e., long-term, immediate, and fluctuating).Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectThe sample included 1345 males and 1283 females in Taiwan. In multilevel models, the between- (i.e., long-term and immediate) and within-person (i.e., fluctuating) effects were estimated by using the average and time-varying scores of depression, respectively. The interactions between long-term and the other effects were also tested to determine the moderating effects of long-term influences.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectSignificant immediate and long-term effects of depression were found for both sexes, indicating that adolescents with higher levels of depression were at increased risks for future sleep problems. For females only, the long-term effects further exacerbated the negative influences of immediate effects of depression on sleep problems. Moreover, the fluctuating effects were found to change over time in females and the influences were more pronounced in young adulthood.Disentangling the effects of depression on trajectories of sleep problems from adolescence through young adulthood - ScienceDirectThe self-reported measures of both depression and sleep problems may produce common method variance and bias the results.

A greater understanding of TR in geriatric psychotherapy is particularly needed for treating late-life depression with executive dysfunction, which predicts poor response to antidepressant medication and presents unique clinical challenges.Therapeutic relationship in the treatment of geriatric depression with executive dysfunction - ScienceDirectParticipants were older patients (N = 220) with major depression and executive dysfunction who received 12 weeks of problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy in a randomized control trial. Multilevel growth curve modeling and latent change scores were used to analyze TR dimensions of Understanding and Accepting at the patient level (individual patient ratings, N = 194) and therapist level (ratings of each therapist averaged across participants, N = 10).Therapeutic relationship in the treatment of geriatric depression with executive dysfunction - ScienceDirectTherapeutic relationship in the treatment of geriatric depression with executive dysfunction - ScienceDirectTR was not assessed throughout the course of treatment (only after the first therapy session and at post-treatment) and did not include ratings from an objective evaluator.Therapeutic relationship in the treatment of geriatric depression with executive dysfunction - ScienceDirectAssessment of patient's experience of the TR and of therapist ability to foster Understanding and Accepting can play a significant role in the delivery of geriatric psychosocial interventions.Therapeutic relationship in the treatment of geriatric depression with executive dysfunction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Family functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectFamily functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectFamily cohesion was significantly associated with less depression among North Korean refugees in South Korea.Family functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectResilience significantly mediated the relationship between family cohesion and depression.Family functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectRefugees without family support may be at particularly high risk for depression.Family functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectFamily support and resilience may be modifiable protective factors among refugees.Family functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectNorth Korean refugees in South Korea are at high risk of depression, but there are few studies exploring protective factors in this population. We hypothesized that family functioning (family adaptability and cohesion) and resilience would protect North Korean refugees from developing depressive symptoms. A subsample of 304 adult North Korean refugees drawn from the cross-sectional 2010 Nationwide Survey of Domestic Violence in South Korea was analyzed. Approximately 44% of respondents were identified as having depression, using scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. In models capturing the full spectrum of depressive symptoms (continuous), family cohesion was significantly associated with depression, and the relationship was partially mediated by resilience. In models predicting clinical depression (dichotomous), resilience fully mediated the relationship between family cohesion and clinical depression. In contrast, family adaptability was not associated with depression or resilience in this sample. These findings suggest that assessing and enhancing family cohesion and resilience may be essential for professionals working with refugees, and that refugees without family support may be at particularly high risk for depression.Family functioning, resilience, and depression among North Korean refugees - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Qualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectQualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectRemoved olfactory bulbs changes in the phospholipid-proteins balance in blood serum of animal depression model.Qualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectThe spectroscopic spectra show structural changes in the protein and phospholipid fractions.Qualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectQualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectChronic use of amitriptyline in control group of rats will decrease in the amount of phospholipids or damage their structure.Qualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectQualitative and quantitative changes in phospholipids and proteins investigated by spectroscopic techniques in olfactory bulbectomy animal depression model - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Does collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectDoes collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectEffects of risk factors for depression are less pronounced in collectivistic Eastern cultures.Does collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectRussia combines Western and Eastern values.Does collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectCollectivistic orientation increased impact of stress and neuroticism on depression in Russia.Does collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectBetween-culture differences in the nature of collectivism should be taken into account.Does collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectSome studies show that effects of risk factors for depression, such as neuroticism, stress, and maladaptive emotion regulation, are less pronounced in collectivistic Eastern than in individualistic Western cultures. The effect of individual patterns of endorsement of individualist and collectivist attitudes on mental health outcomes is more difficult to predict in diverse cultures, such as Russia, which traditionally combines Western and Eastern values. In this study, data on depressive symptoms, personality, stress level, emotion regulation strategies, and individualist/collectivist orientation were collected in a nonclinical Russian sample and structural equation modeling was used to assess the impact of cultural attitudes on the association between depression and the vulnerability factors. In sharp contrast with effects reported in collectivist East Asian cultures, collectivistic orientation appeared to increase the impact of stress and neuroticism on depression. This evidence highlights the necessity of a more nuanced approach to the study of cultural dimensions, such as individualism/collectivism, taking into account substantial between-culture differences in the nature of these constructs.Does collectivism act as a protective factor for depression in Russia? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Text messaging to support a perinatal collaborative care model for depression: A multi-methods inquiry - ScienceDirectMental health care integrated into obstetric settings improves access to perinatal depression treatments.

Client and therapist factors related to sudden gains were examined to investigate processes associated with outcome. Methods: Participants were postpartum Women with Major Depressive Disorder (n=42) who received online BA supported in 30-minute telephone sessions by a mental health worker. Depression symptoms were assessed at each session and number of sessions completed were recorded by the online program. Therapist records were rated for client stressful life event and therapist concrete focus. A quadratic pattern provided the best fit with the data; a cubic pattern was a poor fit. Sudden gains, but not depression spikes, predicted lower depression scores at 17-week outcome. Women who had higher baseline social functioning, did not experience a stressful life event during therapy, and completed more online modules, but not more telephone sessions, were more likely to have a sudden gain. A concrete therapist focus was associated with sudden gains. These results extend research on trajectories of change and sudden gains to an online BA treatment and to postpartum depression, and suggest important client and therapist factors associated with sudden gains.Shape of change in internet based behavioral activation treatment for depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectWorkforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectThis study explored what relates to early childhood educators' depression.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectSample consisted of early childhood educators in licensed homes, centers, and schools.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectAspects of teachers' beliefs, economic status, and stress related to depression.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectBeliefs were more closely associated with depression in home-based settings.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectResults suggest ways to support the well-being of the workforce.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectWorkforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Workforce well-being: Personal and workplace contributions to early educators' depression across settings - ScienceDirectThis work was supported by the Holland Foundation.Depression and sterile inflammation: Essential role of danger associated molecular patterns - ScienceDirectDepression and sterile inflammation: Essential role of danger associated molecular patterns - ScienceDirectStress promotes the release of endogenous factors known as danger associated molecular patterns (DAMP).Depression and sterile inflammation: Essential role of danger associated molecular patterns - ScienceDirectDAMP-mediated sterile inflammation influence mood and psychiatric health.Depression and sterile inflammation: Essential role of danger associated molecular patterns - ScienceDirectChronic sterile inflammation may contribute to depression onset and recurrence.Depression and sterile inflammation: Essential role of danger associated molecular patterns - ScienceDirectStress is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorder including major depressive disorder (MDD) and can induce inflammation, which is known to be dysregulated in depression. Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong association between depressive symptoms and the expression of factors that increase inflammation. Conversely, administration of anti-inflammatory agents has been shown to ameliorate depressive symptoms, demonstrating the importance of inflammation as a mediator of depression. Although it is clear that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, the mechanism by which inflammation is activated in mood disorders remains unclear. To address this issue, studies have investigated the role of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation in stress-induced inflammation and mood disorders. However, the identification of the endogenous factors, referred to as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) that activate these receptors remains understudied. Here we review the role of DAMPs in depression and highlight the clinical evidence for elevation of DAMP signaling in MDD patients and in pre-clinical animal stress models of depression.Depression and sterile inflammation: Essential role of danger associated molecular patterns - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Factors associated with depression and severe depression in patients with COPD - ScienceDirectDepression is very prevalent in COPD and may be associated with poor clinical outcomes.Factors associated with depression and severe depression in patients with COPD - ScienceDirectThis was a multicenter, cross-sectional study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of depression and moderate to severe depression in COPD.

Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been found in depressed patients and constitute a potential mechanism by which brain volume varies in depression. We have tested the association of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) as assessed with Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) as assessed with Arterial Spin Labeling Magnetic Resonance Imaging (ASL-MRI) with Total Brain Volume (TBV) and the volume of seven subcortical regions, in currently depressed and long-term remitted patients. In addition, we have evaluated other potential confounders for the association depression/brain volume, including dimensional symptoms of depression, cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and antidepressants.Cerebral blood flow velocity positively correlates with brain volumes in long-term remitted depression - ScienceDirectSeventy-five individuals were recruited, divided in 3 equal groups (currently depressed, remitted individuals and healthy controls) and were submitted to clinical assessment, MRI and Transcranial Doppler.Cerebral blood flow velocity positively correlates with brain volumes in long-term remitted depression - ScienceDirectCBFV was positively correlated with TBV, Hippocampus and Thalamus volume, but only in remitted patients, who tend to have larger brains compared to both currently depressed and controls. CVRF were negatively associated with brain volumes in the 3 groups and antidepressant use was associated with larger Thalamus. We found no association between brain volumes and CBF as assessed with ASL-MRI, anhedonia, anxiety or psychomotor retardation.Cerebral blood flow velocity positively correlates with brain volumes in long-term remitted depression - ScienceDirectGreater CBFV may be a physiological mechanism by which brain is enlarged in remitted patients.

However, the clinical significance of this on outcomes such as depression and suicidal thinking has not been explored. This study examines the association of autism spectrum traits, depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviour in individuals with psychotic experiences.Autism and psychosis: Clinical implications for depression and suicide - ScienceDirectIn two cross sectional studies, individuals from a non-help seeking university student sample and patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) service completed standardized measures of autism spectrum traits, psychotic experiences, depressive symptoms and suicidal thinking.Autism and psychosis: Clinical implications for depression and suicide - ScienceDirectIn healthy non-help seeking students, increased autism traits and increased subclinical psychotic experiences were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; a significant interaction effect suggests their combined presence has a greater impact on depression. In FEP, high autism traits and positive symptoms were associated with increased depression, hopelessness and suicidality, however there was no significant interaction effect.

In this study, we aimed to determine the association of polymorphisms in candidate genes of the gene transduction pathway with PSD, as well as the effects of the interactions between genes in our Chinese sample.Genetic variations in the p11/tPA/BDNF pathway are associated with post stroke depression - ScienceDirectTwo-hundred-fifty-four Chinese samples with acute ischaemic stroke included 122 PSD patients and 132 nonPSD patients. Sixty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (p11, tPA, PAI-1, BDNF, TrkB and p75NTR) of the p11/tPA/BDNF pathway with minor allele frequencies > 5% were successfully genotyped from an initial series of 76 SNPs. The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale score. Environmental factors were measured with the life events scale and social support rating scale for all patients. SNP and haplotype associations were analysed using gPLINK software. Gene-gene interactions were evaluated with generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction software.Genetic variations in the p11/tPA/BDNF pathway are associated with post stroke depression - ScienceDirectThe results showed that TrkB polymorphisms (rs11140793AC genotype, rs7047042CG genotype, rs1221CT genotype, rs2277193TC genotype and rs2277192AG genotype) were significantly associated with PSD. Three haplotypes (AT, GG, and AAT) of TrkB were significantly associated with PSD. Seven haplotypes (GC, AG, ACG, CGC, GCT, ACGC and ACAT) of BDNF were significantly correlated with PSD. We identified significant gene-gene interactions between the p11 (rs11204922 SNP), tPA (rs8178895, rs2020918 SNPs) and BDNF (rs6265, rs2049046, rs16917271, rs727155 SNPs) genes in the PSD group.

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent and new research suggests that it may have an impact on mood, primarily through an effect on neurotransmitters. Numerous observational studies suggest a relationship between low levels of vitamin D and increased incidence and severity of mood disorders. A small number of pilot studies have been undertaken but lack rigorous methodology required to draw conclusions about a clinical role for this nutrient in treatment resistant depression.Adjunctive Vitamin D in the treatment of non-remitted depression: Lessons from a failed clinical trial - ScienceDirectAdjunctive Vitamin D in the treatment of non-remitted depression: Lessons from a failed clinical trial - ScienceDirectOver three recruitment period years (fall/winter), a total of 148 participants completed screening, 24 (16.2%) of whom qualified to participate in the study. Use of too many or no psychiatric medications, comorbid exclusionary psychiatric conditions, current use of a vitamin D supplement, and lack of participant compensation were the predominant reasons for ineligibility or unwillingness to participate. 9 participants were successfully enrolled in the study, 7 (77.8%) of whom completed the trial as per the protocol. After the third season, futility was declared based on inability to enroll participants. The sample size of enrolled participants (7/125, 5.6%) lacks power to conduct a full assessment of findings.Adjunctive Vitamin D in the treatment of non-remitted depression: Lessons from a failed clinical trial - ScienceDirectHigh accessibility of vitamin D, as well as a growing lack of equipoise in patients and clinicians about the potential ubiquitous benefits of vitamin D for Canadians, not just for mood disorders, resulted in a large proportion of ineligible potential participants. Limited funding provided to studies on natural health products hampered recruitment. The labile and fluctuating nature of non-remitted depression as well as frequent co-morbid conditions creates additional challenges for conducting trials in this population. Future studies assessing vitamin D in depression should consider our experiences in design and conduct of research. Innovations in clinical trial design such as preference trials or accepting patients already using vitamin D but not achieving an optimal target value are potential solutions to some of these challenges.Relapse insomnia increases greater risk of anxiety and depression: evidence from a population-based 4-year cohort study - ScienceDirectRelapse insomnia increases greater risk of anxiety and depression: evidence from a population-based 4-year cohort study - ScienceDirectLongitudinal impacts of insomnia subtypes on the risk of anxiety and depression was examined.Relapse insomnia increases greater risk of anxiety and depression: evidence from a population-based 4-year cohort study - ScienceDirectBeing predisposed to insomnia increases the risk of anxiety by 8.8-fold, the risk of depression by 8.48-fold, and the risk of both anxiety and depression by 17.98-fold, compared to non-insomniacs.Relapse insomnia increases greater risk of anxiety and depression: evidence from a population-based 4-year cohort study - ScienceDirectRelapse insomniacs have the greatest risks of developing psychiatric disorders compared to individuals with persistent and remission insomnia.Relapse insomnia increases greater risk of anxiety and depression: evidence from a population-based 4-year cohort study - ScienceDirectWe investigated the longitudinal impacts of insomnia on the subsequent developments of anxiety and depression during a four-year follow-up.

A total of 435 Chinese adolescents who experienced a tornado in Yancheng city reported their level of depressive symptoms (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children; CES-DC), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory; PTGI) and dispositional mindfulness (Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale; MAAS). The current study found that for individuals with higher dispositional mindfulness, their depression was associated with more posttraumatic growth, while the individuals with lower dispositional mindfulness showed no such association. These findings suggest that individuals high in dispositional mindfulness possess the potential to benefit from the process of adaptive coping in response to depression following a traumatic experience. The implications of the results for research and mindfulness-based interventions targeting depression were discussed.Dispositional mindfulness moderates the relationship between depression and posttraumatic growth in Chinese adolescents following a tornado - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Differences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectDifferences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectComprehensive investigation of the autonomic nervous system including various branchesDifferences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectSympathetic predominance in patients indicated by skin conductance and pupil size, but not by heart rate variability.Differences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectHighly accurate classification of patients and controls considering heart rate, pupillary unrest and skin conductanceDifferences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectInconsistent results have been reported with respect to cardiac autonomic function in major depression. The aim of our study was to investigate autonomic function in various branches of the autonomic nervous system in order to better understand parasympathetic and sympathetic modulation in the disease.Differences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectWe investigated 29 unmedicated patients suffering from major depression (MD) in comparison to matched control subjects (gender, age, BMI). The autonomic assessment at rest included values of heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), respiration, skin conductance (SC) as well as the calculation of pupillary diameter and the unrest index (PUI). Results were compared by means of a multivariate analysis of variance. In a classification analysis, we identified suitable parameters for patient - control separation. Finally, to analyze interrelations of pupillometric parameters and autonomic indices, we estimated Pearson correlation coefficients and fitted a linear regression model.Differences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectDifferences of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in major depression - ScienceDirectOur data add evidence to the current debate on autonomic function in major depression. We suggest that diverse results are mainly caused by methodological shortcomings, in particular by the application of HRV assessment only, which misses changes of sympathetic modulation.

It is unclear whether depression that develops in this manner is similar to or different from NDE in persons not exposed to opioid analgesic use (OAU).Characteristics of new depression diagnoses in patients with and without prior chronic opioid use - ScienceDirectVA patients were classified into two groups, those who did not receive an opioid and developed depression (non-OAU+NDE, n=4314) and those that had >90 days OAU and developed NDE (OAU+NDE, n=444). OAU+NDE patients were compared to non-OAU+NDE in terms of depression severity (PHQ-9 scores), incidence of PTSD, other anxiety disorders and substance use disorders after NDE, receipt of acute phase antidepressant treatment, dual antidepressant treatment, mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Prior to computing bivariate analysis, the prevalence of pain conditions and average maximum pain scores were equalized between the two groups using propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting.Characteristics of new depression diagnoses in patients with and without prior chronic opioid use - ScienceDirectControlling for pain, OAU+NDE patients had more depression symptoms (p=.012), more incident PTSD (p=.04) and opioid abuse/dependence and were more likely to receive 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment (p<.0001). Last, non-OAU+NDE were more likely to have incident diagnoses for any other anxiety disorder (p=.014).Characteristics of new depression diagnoses in patients with and without prior chronic opioid use - ScienceDirectWithin the limitations of electronic medical record data, results indicate OAU+NDE patients have more depression symptoms, greater treatment adherence and different comorbid psychiatric conditions compared to non-OAU+NDE, independent of pain. Overall OAU related depression is as severe as non-OAU related depression and repeated depression screening in chronic opioid therapy may be warranted for pain patients, regardless of pain severity.Characteristics of new depression diagnoses in patients with and without prior chronic opioid use - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effectiveness of unguided internet cognitive behavioural therapy for mixed anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectThe effectiveness of unguided internet cognitive behavioural therapy for mixed anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectThis study investigated two brief unguided iCBT programs for mixed anxiety and depressionThe effectiveness of unguided internet cognitive behavioural therapy for mixed anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectParticipants who completed experienced significant reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as distressThe effectiveness of unguided internet cognitive behavioural therapy for mixed anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectThe pre-post effect sizes were large and similar to those found in guided iCBT interventionsThe effectiveness of unguided internet cognitive behavioural therapy for mixed anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectUnguided iCBT programs are effective for people who complete the programThe effectiveness of unguided internet cognitive behavioural therapy for mixed anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectBehavioral characteristics of subthreshold depression - ScienceDirectThis study examines differences in behavioral characteristics among individuals who are not depressed and individuals with subthreshold depression, and depression.Behavioral characteristics of subthreshold depression - ScienceDirectWe conducted structured interviews with 111 undergraduate students, who also completed self-report scales.

The secure style predicted compared to preoccupied attachment a significantly higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 1.10 years), compared to dismissing attachment a higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 2.20 years) and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.14; BDI 6.04 vs. 9.52), and compared to fearful attachment a lower relapse/recurrence rate (45.7% vs. 76.9%), higher proportions of depression diagnosis-free time (7.31 vs. 6.65 years) and symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 0.29 years), and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.19; BDI 6.04 vs. 15.54).Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care - ScienceDirectSample size was restricted.Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care - ScienceDirectInsecure attachment predicts an unfavorable course of depression over a seven-year period.Depression as a systemic disease - ScienceDirectDepression as a systemic disease - ScienceDirectDepression increases the risk and progression of a variety of medical disorders.Depression as a systemic disease - ScienceDirectIncreased inflammation is observed in cancer, heart disease and depression.Depression as a systemic disease - ScienceDirectChildhood trauma predisposes to depression and increased inflammation.Depression as a systemic disease - ScienceDirectDepression is a risk factor for osteoporosis and fractures in the elderly.Depression as a systemic disease - ScienceDirectDepression is now conceptualized as a systemic illness because of neurobiological mechanisms that explain how it influences other medical illnesses. Significant research has been conducted to explain the mechanisms by which depression increases the risk of, and complicates, already established medical illness. Biological processes as diverse as inflammation, neuroendocrine regulation, platelet activity, autonomic nervous system activity, and skeletal homeostasis are influenced by depression. In this review we aim to elucidate the mechanisms through which depression affects patients with heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis. These are conditions in which the interplay between depression and medical illness continues to be investigated.Anxiety and depression in patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi - ScienceDirectThe aim of the study was to evaluate the symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with fibromyalgia and erythema migrans in Borrelia burgdorferi infection.Anxiety and depression in patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi - ScienceDirectA group of 87 patients with clinically and serologically diagnosed B. burgdorferi (mean age 53.37) was formed.

However, there was an exact diagnostic match between the screening scales and the CIS-R in only 62.9% of those with high scores.Screening for anxiety, depression, and anxious depression in primary care: A field study for ICD-11 PHC - ScienceDirectThis study was confined to those in whom the PCP suspected psychological distress, so does not provide information about the prevalence of mental disorders in primary care settings.Screening for anxiety, depression, and anxious depression in primary care: A field study for ICD-11 PHC - ScienceDirectThe two five-item screening scales for anxiety and depression provide a practical way for PCPs to evaluate the likelihood of mood and anxiety disorders without paper and pencil measures that are not feasible in many settings. These scales may provide substantially improved case detection as compared to current primary care practice and a realistic alternative to complex diagnostic algorithms used by specialist mental health professionals.Screening for anxiety, depression, and anxious depression in primary care: A field study for ICD-11 PHC - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Adherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirectAdherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirectLittle is known about the adherence to dietary recommendations and depression.Adherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirectAdhering to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression overall.Adherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirectDietary habits differ by subtypes of depression.Adherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirect5-a-day recommendation was associated with current unspecified- and melancholic depression.Adherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirectAdherence to dietary recommendations is not associated with depression in two Swiss population-based samples - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Avoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectAvoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectRemitted depressed individuals reported greater levels of avoidance than controls.Avoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectRemitted depressed individuals reported lower levels of avoidance than currently depressed individuals.Avoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectAvoidance was significantly associated with use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies.Avoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectAvoidance was largely unrelated to use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.Avoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectBehavioral theories posit that depression is characterized by heightened levels of avoidance, and recent research has supported this notion. Whether avoidance persists after remission from depression is unknown, however. In this study, we investigated levels of cognitive and behavioral avoidance in remitted, currently, and never depressed individuals. We also examined relationships among avoidance and purported adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. Remitted depressed individuals exhibited levels of cognitive and behavioral avoidance, in social and nonsocial domains, that were greater than nonclinical control individuals but lower than currently depressed individuals. Avoidance was significantly associated with use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, although the pattern of relationships differed across remitted and currently depressed individuals. In contrast, avoidance was largely unrelated to use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies, among remitted and currently depressed individuals.Avoidance and depression vulnerability: An examination of avoidance in remitted and currently depressed individuals - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Decreased Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor May Indicate the Development of Poststroke Depression in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectDepression is a common complication after stroke and has been associated with poor outcome. Thus, it is of great importance to identify potential biomarkers that can aid in predicting and detecting patients with stroke at high risk of poststroke depression (PSD) development. Previous studies showed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) had potential use as a biomarker for discriminating patients with stroke at high risk of PSD. However, the results were inconsistent.Decreased Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor May Indicate the Development of Poststroke Depression in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectA meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the peripheral BDNF levels and the development of PSD in the acute stage of stroke.Decreased Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor May Indicate the Development of Poststroke Depression in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectData were obtained from 4 studies including 499 patients with stroke. Among them, 171 patients were diagnosed with PSD at follow-ups. Our results showed that patients with stroke who were predisposed to developing PSD had significantly lower serum BDNF concentrations at the early stage of stroke.Decreased Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor May Indicate the Development of Poststroke Depression in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThis study suggests a potential association between circulating BDNF concentrations at admission and subsequent PSD development, and provides additional support for the involvement of BDNF in the PSD development.Decreased Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor May Indicate the Development of Poststroke Depression in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Decreased Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor May Indicate the Development of Poststroke Depression in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Qi deficiency is associated with depression in chronic hemodialysis patients - ScienceDirectQi deficiency is associated with depression in chronic hemodialysis patients - ScienceDirectDepression is a common psychological problem in chronic hemodialysis patients.Qi deficiency is associated with depression in chronic hemodialysis patients - ScienceDirectThe Gentleness constitution was associated with less depression.Qi deficiency is associated with depression in chronic hemodialysis patients - ScienceDirectQi-deficiency was associated with depression in chronic hemodialysis patients.Qi deficiency is associated with depression in chronic hemodialysis patients - ScienceDirectDepression is a common bio-psycho-social problem in hemodialysis (HD) patients.

Despite the wide range of antidepressants available, they all share similar mechanisms of action and are only marginally effective in patients. In addition, these compounds need several weeks of treatment to cause the remission of depressive symptoms and are associated with multiple side effects. These factors contribute to the lack of adhesion to treatment by a significant percentage of depressive patients. In contrast, plant-derived agents are comparatively more tolerable and possess fewer side effects. Hence, the interest in phytochemicals with antidepressant potential is increasing in an effort to establish novel strategies for the management of this psychiatric disorder. This chapter reviews evidence on the antidepressant effects elicited by natural compounds belonging to polyphenol and terpenoid classes and their mechanisms of action. Polyphenols (flavonoids, nonflavonoids such as resveratrol, curcumin, coumarin, and phenolic acids) have antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, which make them suitable as complementary medicinal compounds for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Terpenoids (such as carvatrol, genipin, hyperforin, and ursolic acid) constitute another large category of phytochemicals that have been shown to produce antidepressant effects in preclinical studies. This chapter also presents the current status of clinical studies testing the effects of supplementation with polyphenols and/or terpenoids in the treatment of depressive disorders.Natural Polyphenols and Terpenoids for Depression Treatment: Current Status - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectTo characterize women's depression literacy during the perinatal period, including their ability to recognize clinically significant symptoms of depression.Depression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectA quantitative, cross-sectional, survey design.Depression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectInternet communities and Web sites focused on the topics of pregnancy and motherhood.Depression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectDepression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectWomen answered self-report questionnaires to assess depression literacy, symptoms of depression, emotional competence, and awareness/recognition of psychopathological symptoms.Depression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectWomen had moderate levels of depression literacy during the perinatal period, with higher literacy levels concerning depression-related characteristics than depression-related treatments. Lower education and lower income were associated with poor depression literacy, whereas prior history of psychiatric problems or treatments was associated with higher levels of depression literacy. An indirect effect through emotional competence in the relationship between depression literacy and awareness/recognition of symptoms was found: women with poor depression literacy tended to have a greater lack of emotional clarity, which negatively affected their symptom awareness and recognition.Depression Literacy and Awareness of Psychopathological Symptoms During the Perinatal Period - ScienceDirectOur results support the need to improve women's mental health literacy during the perinatal period.

Here, we summarize evidence that point at anxiety trait as a significant contributor to inter-individual differences in stress-vulnerability. Specifically, we underscore high anxiety trait as a key vulnerability phenotype. Highly anxious individuals show both behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits, along with more reactive physiological stress responses. We discuss efforts and progress towards the identification of genetic variants and polygenetic scores that explain differences in trait anxiety and vulnerability to stress. We then summarize molecular alterations in the brain of individuals with high anxiety trait that can help explaining the increased vulnerability to stress of these individuals. Variation in such systems can act as risk factors, which in combination with severe/prolonged stressful life events can pave the way towards the development of depression. Our viewpoint implies that the consideration of high anxiety trait as a key vulnerability phenotype in stress research can support the overall aim to obtain improved or novel therapeutic approaches.High anxiety trait: A vulnerable phenotype for stress-induced depression - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (89KB)Download full-size imageDepression as seen through the eyes of rural Chinese women: Implications for help-seeking and the future of mental health care in China - ScienceDirectDepression as seen through the eyes of rural Chinese women: Implications for help-seeking and the future of mental health care in China - ScienceDirectRrural residents do not express depression that is consistent with Western notions.Depression as seen through the eyes of rural Chinese women: Implications for help-seeking and the future of mental health care in China - ScienceDirectStigma remain potentially powerful influences on the treatment-seeking decisions.Depression as seen through the eyes of rural Chinese women: Implications for help-seeking and the future of mental health care in China - ScienceDirectProvision of services in the future will depend on training primary care doctors.Depression as seen through the eyes of rural Chinese women: Implications for help-seeking and the future of mental health care in China - ScienceDirectAs part of a larger epidemiological study of depression among rural Chinese women, we sought to understand their explanatory models of depression.

A review - ScienceDirectAlthough dementia is primarily considered a memory disorder, there are significant neuropsychiatric manifestations sufficient to cause decline in ability to carry out social or occupational functioning independently. Depressive symptoms are extremely common in demented patients, and may be present very early in the course of the disease. To describe depression observed in patients suffering from dementia. Medline and Google Scholar searches were conducted for relevant articles, chapters, and books published before 2014. Search terms used included depression, dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, vascular dementia. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references. Depression and dementia are common in older people and their association is very complex. The reported prevalence of comorbid depression or depressive symptoms in individuals with dementia has been quite variable, likely due to differences in methods of assessment, diagnostic criteria, stages of dementia, and other factors. Little empirical evidence is available to guide the clinicians in the selection of treatment. Comorbid depression complicates diagnosis, affects treatment approaches and outcomes, and decreases the quality of life of affected individuals as well as their caregivers. The coexistence of depression and dementia has emerged as a significant public health problem leading to increased health care utilization and costs.Depression and dementia.

The Distress Thermometer and Problem List (DT&PL) is commonly used in oncology clinics to screen for distress and its accompanying Physical Problem List (PPL) identifies pertinent physical symptoms. However, the identification of physical symptoms found on the PPL has never been evaluated for its association with psychological symptoms in women with breast cancer.Physical Symptom Burden and its Association with Distress, Anxiety and Depression in Breast Cancer - ScienceDirectPatients (n=125) with breast cancer (Stage 0-IV) completed the DT&PL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). They reported bother from any of 22 PPL items on the DT&PL. PPL items were assessed for their associations with distress (DT), anxiety (HADS-A), and depression (HADS-D). The total number of PPL items endorsed per patient was evaluated for associations with psychological outcomes, controlling for relevant demographic factors.Physical Symptom Burden and its Association with Distress, Anxiety and Depression in Breast Cancer - ScienceDirectMost physical problems were associated with depression (n=13, 87%), and anxiety (n=8, 53%), but fewer were associated with distress (n=4, 27%).

Research has shown conflicting evidence for white matter alteration and amygdala volume reduction in mood and anxiety disorders. To date, no studies have examined differences in structural connectivity between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. This study compared fractional anisotropy (FA) and density of selected white matter tracts and amygdala volume between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals.A comparison of structural connectivity in anxious depression versus non-anxious depression - ScienceDirect64- direction DTI and T1 scans were collected from 110 unmedicated subjects with MDD, 39 of whom had a co-morbid anxiety disorder diagnosis. Region of interest (ROI) and tractography methods were performed to calculate amygdala volume and FA in the uncinate fasciculus, respectively. Diffusion connectometry was performed to identify whole brain group differences in white matter health. Correlations were computed between biological and clinical measures.A comparison of structural connectivity in anxious depression versus non-anxious depression - ScienceDirectTractography and ROI analyses showed no significant differences between bilateral FA values or bilateral amygdala volumes when comparing the anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed groups. The diffusion connectometry analysis showed no significant differences in anisotropy between the groups. Furthermore, there were no significant relationships between MRI-based and clinical measures.A comparison of structural connectivity in anxious depression versus non-anxious depression - ScienceDirectThe lack of group differences could indicate that structural connectivity and amygdalae volumes of those with anxious-depression are not significantly altered by a co-morbid anxiety disorder.

Significant psychosocial influences on surgical outcomes have been found with numerous procedures. The objective of this study is to perform a systematic review of randomized-control trials and observational studies to examine the relationships between pre-operative depression and post-operative (<6 weeks) pain outcomes.Does preoperative depression predict post-operative surgical pain: A systematic review - ScienceDirectPubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched for studies published from January 1, 2006 and August 31, 2016. Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of each report based on predefined inclusion criteria (study design, measure of pre-operative depression, and post-operative pain). Participants included adult patients undergoing surgical procedures diagnosed with depression pre-operatively. Patients were assessed for post-operative pain via pain scales and use of post-operative pain medications. Data was summarized qualitatively due to limitations of comparability and transformation. Significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the included studies was identified.Does preoperative depression predict post-operative surgical pain: A systematic review - ScienceDirectOf 1091 abstracts reviewed, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. Due to the significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not performed. 8 studies (comprising a total of 1314 patients) reported a statistically significant effect of pre-operative depression on post-operative pain. 10 studies encompassing a total 1226 patients failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of depression on postoperative pain.Does preoperative depression predict post-operative surgical pain: A systematic review - ScienceDirectThe analysis of results was limited to a systematic review and qualitative analysis of the eligible studies. Based on this systematic review we identified 8 studies reporting a statistically significant effect of pre-operative depression on post-operative pain and 10 studies reporting no statistically significant effect of pre-operative depression on post-operative pain. Therefore, the quality of presented data is poor and makes it challenging to answer further questions. Large epidemiologic studies in this field are needed to provide further evidence.Does preoperative depression predict post-operative surgical pain: A systematic review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectFirst study to determine the 12-months prevalence of major and minor depressionThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectThe 12-months prevalence of depression is in line with other European countriesThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectAbsence of gender difference in the prevalence of major or minor depressionThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectCertain factors related with major and minor depression have been foundThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectCross-sectional nature of the studyThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectThis cross-sectional study aims to assess the 12-month prevalence of major and minor depression in the Latvian population, and to evaluate associated health care utilization.The 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectThe 12-month prevalence of depression and health care utilization in the general population of Latvia - ScienceDirectThe study was cross-sectional.

It learns to associate other stimuli with these to produce representations of the expected reward value for visual, auditory, and abstract stimuli including monetary reward value. The orbitofrontal cortex thus plays a key role in emotion, by representing the reward value of the goals for action. The learning process is stimulus-reinforcer association learning. Negative reward prediction error neurons are related to this affective learning. Activations in the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with the subjective emotional experience of affective stimuli, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs emotion-related learning, emotional behaviour, and subjective affective state. Top-down attention to affect modulates orbitofrontal cortex representations, and attention to intensity modulates representations in earlier cortical areas that represent the physical properties of stimuli. Top-down word-level cognitive inputs can bias affective representations in the orbitofrontal cortex, providing a mechanism for cognition to influence emotion. Whereas the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of reward or affective value on a continuous scale, areas beyond the orbitofrontal cortex such as the medial prefrontal cortex area 10 are involved in binary decision-making when a choice must be made. For this decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of the value of each specific reward on the same scale, with no conversion to a common currency. Increased activity in a lateral orbitofrontal cortex non-reward area provides a new attractor-related approach to understanding and treating depression. Consistent with the theory, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex has increased functional connectivity in depression, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, involved in reward, has decreased functional connectivity in depression.The orbitofrontal cortex and emotion in health and disease, including depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The orbitofrontal cortex and emotion in health and disease, including depression - ScienceDirectThe orbitofrontal cortex and emotion in health and disease, including depression - ScienceDirecthttp://www.oxcns.org.Developmental trajectories and longitudinal mediation effects of self-esteem, peer attachment, child maltreatment and depression on early adolescents - ScienceDirectThe purpose of this study is to identify the developmental trajectories of peer attachment, self-esteem, depression, and child maltreatment, and to understand the longitudinal mediation effects that peer attachment and self-esteem have on the influence of perceived abuse on early adolescent depression.Developmental trajectories and longitudinal mediation effects of self-esteem, peer attachment, child maltreatment and depression on early adolescents - ScienceDirectThis study uses Year 1 to Year 5 data of the 4th grader panel of the Korea Youth Panel Survey (KYPS) and utilizes a multivariate latent growth model to analyze the main variables in the applicable data between 5th (i.e., Year 2) and 8th (i.e., Year 5) grades.Developmental trajectories and longitudinal mediation effects of self-esteem, peer attachment, child maltreatment and depression on early adolescents - ScienceDirectThe results indicate that from the 5th to the 8th grade, the degree of abuse and depression increases while self-esteem gradually decreases with slowly lowering peer attachment. A significant distribution of the initial values and the rate of change were present for all main variables of the study, confirming individual differences in time wise changes. Further, more exposure to abuse correlated with a decrease in self-esteem, while an increase in self-esteem greatly reduced depression. The initial value of self-esteem showed a partial mediation effect, whereas the rate of change indicated a full mediation effect with a significant longitudinal mediation effect. More experience of abuse during early adolescence indicated a lower degree of peer attachment, and a higher peer attachment was related to decreased depression. A significant partial mediation effect was present for both the initial value and the rate of change of peer attachment, and a longitudinal mediation effect was present.Developmental trajectories and longitudinal mediation effects of self-esteem, peer attachment, child maltreatment and depression on early adolescents - ScienceDirectThis study confirmed that self-esteem in early adolescents is an important protective factor that can greatly reduce the degree of depression, and suggests continuous interventions conducted to increase self-esteem in adolescence. Furthermore, by determining that peer attachment decreases the degree of depression in children at risk, the study emphasizes the healing aspect of adolescent peer attachment.Developmental trajectories and longitudinal mediation effects of self-esteem, peer attachment, child maltreatment and depression on early adolescents - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Treated versus Untreated Depression in Total Joint Arthroplasty Impacts Outcomes - ScienceDirectTo determine if there was a difference in the change in patient reported physical function (PF) between non-depressed and medically treated depressed or untreated depressed total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients.Treated versus Untreated Depression in Total Joint Arthroplasty Impacts Outcomes - ScienceDirectTreated versus Untreated Depression in Total Joint Arthroplasty Impacts Outcomes - ScienceDirectUntreated depressed cases demonstrated much smaller gains in PF scores compared to non-depressed patients (p=0.020).

In this review, we summarize advances from affective neuroscience using neural measures to assess vulnerabilities in youth at high risk for depression due to parental history of depression or temperament style, as well as prospective designs evaluating the predictive validity of these vulnerabilities for symptoms and diagnoses of depression across development. Evidence from multiple levels of analysis indicates that healthy youth at high risk for depression exhibit abnormalities in components of the Research Domain Criteria positive valence systems, including blunted activation in the striatum during reward anticipation and feedback, and that some of these measures can be used to predict later symptoms. In addition, alterations in components of the Research Domain Criteria negative valence systems, including neural processing of sadness, loss, and threat, have been observed in risk for depression, though effects appear to be more task and method dependent. Within the social processes domain, preliminary evidence indicates that neural processing of social feedback, including heightened reactivity to exclusion and blunted response to social reward, may be related to depression vulnerability. These studies indicate that affective neuroscience can inform understanding of developmental pathways to depression and identify altered emotional processing among youth at high risk. We provide an integrated summary of replicated findings from this literature, along with recommendations for future directions and implications for early intervention.Depression, anxiety, and psychotropic medication use and fecundability - ScienceDirectThe literature regarding the associations between depression, anxiety, and fecundity is inconsistent.

We evaluated the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) as a screening tool for depression during the acute stroke admission by determining the prevalence of positive depression screen during admission and by calculating the level of agreement between positive screens during admission and follow-up.Evaluation of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 as a Screening Tool for Depression during the Acute Stroke Admission - ScienceDirectThis was a retrospective cohort of adult stroke survivors discharged January to December 2013 with principal discharge diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. Depression screening was systematically performed during the hospital admission using the PHQ-2. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which includes the PHQ-2, was completed by patients at outpatient follow-up.Evaluation of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 as a Screening Tool for Depression during the Acute Stroke Admission - ScienceDirectThe study cohort consisted of 337 patients with mean age of 66.3 years. Median time from admission to PHQ-2 was 3 days (interquartile range 1-4 days). The screen was positive for depression in 4.7% (95% confidence interval 2.7%-7.6%) of patients. Of the 150 patients with PHQ-9 data at outpatient follow up, 19.3% screened positive for depression. In both the inpatient setting and at outpatient follow-up, the prevalence of a positive depression screen was similar between patients with and without a history of depression or antidepressant use.Evaluation of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 as a Screening Tool for Depression during the Acute Stroke Admission - ScienceDirectSystematic screening for depression using PHQ-2 during hospitalization for acute stroke identified few patients. Most patients with depressive symptoms were identified only at the time of outpatient follow-up.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of depressive symptoms on EEG oscillatory dynamics accompanying implicit processing of angry and happy facial expressions in 46 healthy subjects.Depression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectThe Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess the presence of depressive symptoms in normal subjects. During the experiment, they were told to categorize the gender of angry, neutral, or happy faces presented to them, while high-resolution EEG was recorded. Analysis of the event-related spectral perturbations and the analysis of dipoles were carried out on EEG recordings using the EEGLAB toolbox.Depression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectHigh depression (HD) and low depression (LD) groups did not differ on error rate and reaction time during categorization of gender. The perception of happy faces was accompanied by higher theta synchronization in the LD than the HD group. In contrast, theta synchronization was higher in the HD than the LD group during perception of angry faces.Depression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectThese findings imply that even at preclinical stages, HD scorers evidence increased emotional arousal to negative and decreased emotional arousal to positive stimuli during implicit emotion processing.Depression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectDepression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectDepression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectDepression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectDepression and implicit emotion processing: An EEG study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Heterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectHeterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectStress, past depression, and cortisol levels influence late-life depression risk.Heterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectThe exact risk factors however, differ according to 5-HTTLPR genotype.Heterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectSS individuals may have a cortisol-related neuroendocrine vulnerability to depression.Heterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectLL individuals are more reactive to stressful events in terms of depression risk.Heterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectVariability in the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) gene can influence the risk of depression associated with adversity, as well as cortisol stress reactivity, although not consistently. No study has examined the impact of both a stressful environment and corticotropic-axis dysfunction on depression, as a function of 5-HTTLPR. This population-based study included 334 subjects aged 65 and older. Depression was measured at both diagnostic (major depression according to DSM-IV) and symptomatic (subthreshold depression) levels of caseness, in addition to 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 genotyping and diurnal cortisol measures. For participants with the SS genotype, higher morning cortisol levels were associated with a 4-fold increased risk of depression. Among LL participants, both evening cortisol levels and recent stressful events increased depression risk, although only the latter remained significant after multivariable adjustment. Conversely, SL individuals appeared somewhat resilient to depression in terms of cortisol and recent stress. These findings indicate that 5-HTTLPR genetic variability appears to influence the association between stress-related factors and late-life depression, although the gene-environment interactions failed to reach statistical significance levels. Participants homozygous for the short allele appeared to have a cortisol-related neuroendocrine vulnerability to depression, while long allele homozygotes were more reactive to stressful events in terms of depression risk.Heterogeneity in HPA axis dysregulation and serotonergic vulnerability to depression - ScienceDirectThese authors contributed equally to this work.Kynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectKynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectWomen have reduced levels of protective vs. toxic kynurenine metabolites than men.Kynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectThis diagnosis-independent effect is driven by a decrease in kynurenic acid (KynA).Kynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectWomen using oral contraceptives (OC) have higher CRP levels than women not using OC.Kynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectWomen using OC have lower KynA concentrations than women not using OC.Kynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectWomen may be more vulnerable to depression due to a hormonal-immune interaction.Kynurenic acid is reduced in females and oral contraceptive users: Implications for depression - ScienceDirectThe incidence of depression is approximately 2-fold greater in women than men but the biological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. One potential mechanism that has been understudied is immune function, which is modulated by sex hormones and differs considerably between males and females. The immune-regulating kynurenine pathway previously has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. In particular, a decreased ratio of neuroprotective (kynurenic acid; KynA) to neurotoxic (3-hydroxykynurenine; 3HK and quinolinic acid; QA) kynurenine pathway metabolites has been reported in several mood disorder subtypes. Yet there is a paucity of research investigating sex differences in the kynurenine pathway in the context of depression. Similarly, oral contraceptive (OC) use has been shown to be a risk factor for depression but to our knowledge this epidemiological relationship has not been considered within the framework of immune dysfunction. Here, we compared the concentrations of c-reactive protein (CRP) and kynurenine pathway metabolites in a combined sample of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and healthy controls (HC) comprising 130 men and 350 women. CRP was measured in a CLIA-certified hospital laboratory. Kynurenine metabolites were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Estradiol and progesterone were quantified with the Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) platform. After controlling for diagnosis, age, sex, BMI, analysis batch, and self-reported childhood trauma we found that women had significantly lower KynA/3HK and KynA/QA ratios than men, and that these results were driven by a decrease in KynA. There was no significant difference between males and females in the concentration of CRP. Further, women taking OC showed significantly higher levels of CRP and lower ratios of KynA/3HK and KynA/QA compared with women on no form of contraception. Moreover, among women using OC, progesterone concentrations were positively correlated with KynA, KynA/3HK, and KynA/QA. Although preliminary, our results indicate that on average, healthy women show the same pattern of kynurenine pathway metabolism as that observed in subjects with depression. This finding raises the possibility that a reduction in KynA concentrations in women may constitute a vulnerability factor that partly explains the higher incidence of depression in females. Further, the significant association between OC use and reduced KynA as well as increased CRP, could conceivably partially account for the epidemiological association between OC use and depression. Nonetheless, because of the cross-sectional nature of this study, these hypotheses need to be more rigorously tested with longitudinal designs and/or large epidemiological studies.Poststroke Anxiety and Depression: Findings from Saudi Arabia - ScienceDirectAnxiety and depression are the two most frequent neuropsychiatric manifestations of stroke.

The most recent 1H-MRS literature review took place over 10 years ago and, reflecting the high level of research on this topic, much has been learned since then. Higher brain choline levels have been linked to an increase in depression, and a cholinergic model for MDD development has been postulated. However, current 1H-MRS studies have been inconclusive regarding the role of choline in depression. Data from eighty-six peer-reviewed studies were analyzed for a random-effects model meta-analysis. Two significant findings are reported. Papers that did not report segmentation had a significant, moderate effect size. Higher choline concentrations in the frontal lobe were found in depressed patients, both in those who responded to treatment and those who did not, after treatment with psychiatric medication, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or electroconvulsive therapy. Findings from this review may add to existing information regarding the role of brain choline in MDD. This may provide a future target for treatment and drug development. It also may serve as a biomarker for treatment progress.Oxytocin plasma levels predict the outcome of psychotherapy: A pilot study in chronic depression - ScienceDirectOxytocin plasma levels predict the outcome of psychotherapy: A pilot study in chronic depression - ScienceDirectLower oxytocin plasma levels predict smaller improvement of depressive symptomatology by CBASP in chronic depression.Oxytocin plasma levels predict the outcome of psychotherapy: A pilot study in chronic depression - ScienceDirectOxytocin plasma levels significantly decrease after social exclusion in chronic depression.Oxytocin plasma levels predict the outcome of psychotherapy: A pilot study in chronic depression - ScienceDirectSlower oxytocin recovery after social exclusion predicts smaller improvement of depressive symptomatology.Oxytocin plasma levels predict the outcome of psychotherapy: A pilot study in chronic depression - ScienceDirectDecrease of oxytocin plasma levels after social exclusion did not predict CBASP outcome.Oxytocin plasma levels predict the outcome of psychotherapy: A pilot study in chronic depression - ScienceDirectOxytocin is associated with bonding and social deficits in psychiatric disorders and has also been discussed as a potential therapeutic intervention to augment psychotherapy.

FA has not been thoroughly studied in adolescents, so the aim of this study was to assess its presence in Egyptian adolescents and its relations to some psychiatric correlates; anxiety and depression.Food addiction relations to depression and anxiety in Egyptian adolescents - ScienceDirectA cross sectional design was used. Four hundred adolescents were interviewed from the different geographic locations in Cairo to assess FA by the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), depression by the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) scale and anxiety by the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) child version questionnaire.Food addiction relations to depression and anxiety in Egyptian adolescents - ScienceDirectFA was present in 12% of the studied adolescents. Depression was present in 74 adolescents (18.5%). FA and depression coexisted in 5 subjects (10.4%). The diagnosis of anxiety was met in 38 adolescents (9.5%) and it coexisted with food addiction in only one adolescent (2%). FA scores showed moderately significant positive correlations with most of the anxiety subtypes as well as with the total score for anxiety and depression. Some FA symptomatology were significantly different between those with and without anxiety and depression.Food addiction relations to depression and anxiety in Egyptian adolescents - ScienceDirectFA exists in Egyptian adolescents and has strong associations with psychiatric comorbidities. Anxiety and depression should be evaluated in every individual with FA and vice versa as these psychiatric morbidities may be the inciting factor for the development of food addiction. Evaluation and treatment should address all the existent comorbidities. Careful attention should be paid to the presence of excess food consumption despite knowledge of adverse consequences, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and important social or occupational activities given up or reduced because their presence coincided in this study with the presence of depression and/or anxiety which makes psychiatric evaluation more valuable.Food addiction relations to depression and anxiety in Egyptian adolescents - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Egyptian Pediatric Association Gazette.The state of knowledge about the relationship between 5-HTTLPR, stress, and depression - ScienceDirectThe state of knowledge about the relationship between 5-HTTLPR, stress, and depression - ScienceDirectMeta-analysis of de novo results is better than literature-based meta-analysis.The state of knowledge about the relationship between 5-HTTLPR, stress, and depression - ScienceDirectOur de novo meta-analysis suggests a null or a modest, non-generalizable interaction.The state of knowledge about the relationship between 5-HTTLPR, stress, and depression - ScienceDirectVery large (N > 500,000) genomic datasets becoming available will settle the question.The state of knowledge about the relationship between 5-HTTLPR, stress, and depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.A randomized clinical trial of adjunctive ketamine anesthesia in electro-convulsive therapy for depression - ScienceDirectA randomized clinical trial of adjunctive ketamine anesthesia in electro-convulsive therapy for depression - ScienceDirectA randomized clinical trial of adjunctive ketamine anesthesia in electro-convulsive therapy for depression - ScienceDirectIt did not enhance the antidepressant effects nor reduced the side effects.A randomized clinical trial of adjunctive ketamine anesthesia in electro-convulsive therapy for depression - ScienceDirectA randomized clinical trial of adjunctive ketamine anesthesia in electro-convulsive therapy for depression - ScienceDirectElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a rapid acting and effective treatment for both major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP).

In this review we investigate the association between childbirth pain and postpartum depression. It is well documented that postpartum depression is an increasing concern which affects not only the mother but can impact the newborn's development. Multiple factors seem to contribute to the likelihood of this depression developing such as the mother's socio-economic background, age, education level, history of childhood abuse as well as the presence of pain catastrophizing traits. Severe acute pain is linked with an increased risk of chronic pain as well as postpartum depression and so it is essential that childbirth pain be managed effectively and in a timely fashion. With this increasing knowledge, we explore the methods used to minimise the risks factors thereby reducing the occurrence of postpartum depression.Childbirth pain and postpartum depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Economic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectEconomic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectIMIs for the treatment of depression have the potential to be cost-effective.Economic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectGuidance might have a positive impact on cost-effectiveness of IMIs.Economic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectIMIs for MDE might not be (cost-)effective as add-on intervention in primary care.Economic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectCost-effectiveness strongly depends on the willingness-to-pay threshold.Economic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectMore cost-effectiveness studies are needed, esp. for IMIs for the prevention of MDE.Economic evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression: A systematic review - ScienceDirectInternet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) targeting depression have been shown to be clinically effective and are considered a cost-effective complement to established interventions.

Even with an eventual recovery, many patients require a trial and error approach, as there are no reliable guidelines to match patients to optimal treatments and many patients develop treatment resistance over time. This situation derives from the heterogeneity of depression and the lack of biomarkers for stratification by distinct depression subtypes. There is thus a dire need for novel therapies. To address these known challenges, we propose a multi-scale framework for fundamental research on depression, aimed at identifying the brain circuits that are dysfunctional in several animal models of depression as well the changes in gene expression that are associated with these models. When combined with human genetic and imaging studies, our preclinical studies are starting to identify candidate circuits and molecules that are altered both in models of disease and in patient populations. Targeting these circuits and mechanisms can lead to novel generations of antidepressants tailored to specific patient populations with distinctive types of molecular and circuit dysfunction.Depression in later life: A closer look at the gender gap - ScienceDirectGender differences in depressive symptoms have been extensively documented, with women reporting a higher number of depressive symptoms than men. However, studies offer different explanations for why such a gap exists. The goal of the current paper is to analyze how much of the observed gender gap in depression may be attributed to (1) compositional versus (2) reporting differences or (3) differences in reactivity to adversities. We contribute to this literature by testing, net of compositional differences, whether the relationship between reporting behavior and depressive symptoms is gendered and whether accounting for the possibility of gender-specific reactivity alters the structure of the gender gap at older ages. Our results show that the observed gender gap in depression (1) only partially derives from compositional differences; (2) is not an artifact of a gender-specific reporting style; and remarkably (3) men appear more sensitive to adversities.Depression in later life: A closer look at the gender gap - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prevalence and Risk Factors of Type 2 Diabetes in Major Depression: A Study on 703 Individuals Referred for Sleep Examinations - ScienceDirectSeveral studies have investigated the prevalence and risk factors of depression in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

There are several methodological limitations of published longitudinal data that may explain these differences, including differences in age at enrollment, depression and blood pressure assessment, and controlling for covariates.Systematic Review: The Association between Late Life Depression and Hypotension - ScienceDirectFurther longitudinal studies to clarify the role of these potentially modifiable factors in the development of this complex illness are essential.Systematic Review: The Association between Late Life Depression and Hypotension - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Effectiveness of Web- and Mobile-Based Treatment of Subthreshold Depression With Adherence-Focused Guidance: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectEffectiveness of Web- and Mobile-Based Treatment of Subthreshold Depression With Adherence-Focused Guidance: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectA web-based CBT intervention is effective in treating subthreshold depression.Effectiveness of Web- and Mobile-Based Treatment of Subthreshold Depression With Adherence-Focused Guidance: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectSelf-report and observer-based ratings yield significant effects on symptom severity.Effectiveness of Web- and Mobile-Based Treatment of Subthreshold Depression With Adherence-Focused Guidance: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectAdherence-focused guidance is acceptable to participants.Effectiveness of Web- and Mobile-Based Treatment of Subthreshold Depression With Adherence-Focused Guidance: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectEffectiveness of Web- and Mobile-Based Treatment of Subthreshold Depression With Adherence-Focused Guidance: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial - ScienceDirectMB and DE obtained funding for this study.

However, emotion recognition is not compromised in some studies, and confidence judgments, which are essential for social interaction, have not been considered to date. Due to the high prevalence rate of depression in women, and sex differences in emotion recognition, the aim of the present study was to investigate emotion recognition and confidence judgments in women with depression. A sample of female patients with depressive disorders (n=45) was compared with female healthy controls (n=30) in their ability to correctly identify facial emotion expressions along with confidence judgments. Groups performed similarly on emotional face recognition and showed no difference regarding confidence ratings. A negative correlation between self-assessed depression and response confidence was found. While some limitations of the study must be taken in consideration (e.g., small number of items per emotion category, low severity of depression), abnormalities in emotion recognition do not seem to be a major feature of depression. As self-assessed depression is accompanied by low response confidence for emotional faces, it is crucial to further examine the role of confidence judgments in emotion recognition, as underconfidence may foster interpersonal insecurity in depression.Emotion recognition in depression: An investigation of performance and response confidence in adult female patients with depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectBarriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectThis review examines barriers and facilitators to physical activity for adults with depression.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectThe most prominent barriers and facilitators could be classified within the emotion domain.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectFuture interventions should use behaviour change techniques that target this emotion domain.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectExercise is now recommended as a treatment for depression in Canada. What remains less clear is how best to encourage exercise uptake by individuals with mood disorders. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify barriers and facilitators to exercise and physical activity participation among individuals with depression.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectA scoping review with systematic searches was conducted. Eligible studies required samples >50% diagnosed with depression or a mood disorder, and reported empirical data on barriers and/or facilitators to physical activity using quantitative and/or qualitative methods. Extracted barriers and facilitators were classified into the fourteen domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF).Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectThirteen studies were included (seven quantitative, six qualitative). The most common barriers were classified under the TDF domains of Emotion, Environmental Context & Resources, Beliefs about Capabilities, and Intentions. The most common facilitators were classified under the domains of Beliefs about Consequences, Social Influences, Emotion and Behavioural Regulation.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectMost identified domains are all common determinants of health behaviours in various models and theories applied to physical activity participation. However, the Emotion domain appears to be particularly important to individuals with depression, and yet is not covered by these traditional theories of behaviour change, and may be overlooked when trying to promote physical activity among this population. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of behaviour change interventions that specifically target the Emotion domain, and clearly report the behaviour change techniques employed to do so.Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among adults with depression: A scoping review - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Isotretinoin treatment for acne and risk of depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectThe relationship between isotretinoin treatment for acne and depression is controversial.

Data from the Longitudinal Study of Child and Adolescent Well-being were used to test hypotheses with a sample of 267 mother-adolescent dyads. Findings demonstrated the longitudinal associations between perceptions of mother-adolescent relationship quality and adolescent and maternal depression. Specifically, maternal depression symptoms were negatively correlated with adolescent perceptions of the relationship at age 12 and 14, which were positively correlated with adolescent depression at age 14. Additionally, youth depression at age 8 was positively correlated with maternal depression at adolescent ages 12 and 14. A significant association was found between youth depression and adolescent perception of the parent-adolescent relationship quality, such that higher youth depression scores were moderately linked with lower adolescent report of quality of the relationship at age 12. Further, higher levels of youth depressive symptoms were associated with lower maternal perception of the parent-adolescent relationship quality at youth age 12. Implications for clinical intervention and research are discussed.Parent-adolescent relationship quality as a link in adolescent and maternal depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Suicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectSuicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectAmong people who died by suicide, CVD and depression was more common among males.Suicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectIndividuals with CVD and depression were more likely to have a past suicide attempt.Suicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectBereavement or financial stressor was common in individuals with CVD and depression.Suicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectFemales with CVD and depression were more likely to die by self-poisoning.Suicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectMales with CVD and depression were more likely to die by shooting.Suicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectSuicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectSuicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectSuicide in males and females with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectPsychological autopsies were not available.

Comparing the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms of depression in a network analysis - ScienceDirectThe symptoms for Major Depression (MD) defined in the DSM-5 differ markedly from symptoms assessed in common rating scales, and the empirical question about core depression symptoms is unresolved. Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes.What are 'good' depression symptoms? Comparing the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms of depression in a network analysis - ScienceDirectWe constructed a network of 28 depression symptoms assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-30) in 3,463 depressed outpatients from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. We estimated the centrality of all IDS-30 symptoms, and compared the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms; centrality reflects the connectedness of each symptom with all other symptoms.What are 'good' depression symptoms? Comparing the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms of depression in a network analysis - ScienceDirectA network with 28 intertwined symptoms emerged, and symptoms differed substantially in their centrality values. Both DSM symptoms (e.g., sad mood) and non-DSM symptoms (e.g., anxiety) were among the most central symptoms, and DSM criteria were not more central than non-DSM symptoms.What are 'good' depression symptoms?

The prevalence of depression was 14.6% in pregnancy, 32.6% at 4-6 weeks and 18.5% at 6 months postpartum, respectively. The prevalence of PTSD was 5.8% in pregnancy, 11.9% at 4-6 weeks postpartum and 9.2% at 6 months postpartum. Anxiety was highest in pregnancy (29.6%) and then decreased to 24.6% 4-6 weeks after birth and to 16.2% 6 months after birth. New-onset cases were most apparent at 4-6 weeks postpartum: 24.6% for depression; 13.7% for anxiety and 8.9% for PTSD.Depression, anxiety, PTSD and comorbidity in perinatal women in Turkey: A longitudinal population-based study - ScienceDirectKey conclusions: A relatively high prevalence of psychological disorders was identified during the perinatal period. Anxiety was most prevalent in pregnancy, and depression and PTSD were highest at 4-6 weeks postpartum. Depression was more common than anxiety 4-6 weeks and 6 months after birth and highly comorbid with anxiety throughout this period. New-onset cases were observed at both 4-6 weeks and 6 months postpartum.Depression, anxiety, PTSD and comorbidity in perinatal women in Turkey: A longitudinal population-based study - ScienceDirectImplications: High rates of affective disorders in pregnancy and after birth highlight three main points: first, it is important to have effective perinatal screening to identify women with psychological needs; second, providing early treatment to women experiencing severe psychological problems is essential to ensure psychological well-being of those women and to prevent chronicity; and finally, psychosocial screening and interventions should be offered until at least 6 months after birth to catch new-onset cases.Depression, anxiety, PTSD and comorbidity in perinatal women in Turkey: A longitudinal population-based study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectMiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectUCMS induced depression-like behavior accompanied with neuronal structural changes in mPFC.MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectUCMS induced miR-134 overexpression and Limk1/cofilin downregulation in mPFC.MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectMiR-134 modulates the structural neuroplasticity via Limk1/cofiling signaling pathway in mPFC.MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectGinsenoside Rg1 ameliorated behavioral and neuronal structural changes induced by UCMS.MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectGinsenoside Rg1 ameliorated the dysregulation of miR-134-Limk1/cofilin signaling induced by UCMS.MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectMiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (183KB)Download full-size imageMiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectThe contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectGender differences in depression in a contemporary sample emerged at age 13.The contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectThe contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectThe contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectThe chronicity burden of clinical depression is similar for boys and girls.The contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectWe probe the adolescent gender difference in depression, asking two critical questions. First, most longitudinal studies of gender differences in adolescent depression date from the 1980s and 1990s, raising the need for a body of evidence on whether the developmental pattern is similar or different today. Second, despite the importance of chronicity to depression, we do not know whether there is a gender difference in the chronicity burden of the disorder.The contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectIn a contemporary longitudinal sample of U.S. adolescents, depression symptoms were assessed at ages 11, 13, 15, and 18, and depression diagnoses were assessed at age 20. To capture the chronicity burden of clinical depression, we assessed for every depressive episode in an individual's lifetime and summed the total number of days spent in episode.The contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectThe contemporary face of gender differences and similarities in depression throughout adolescence: Development and chronicity - ScienceDirectDepression diagnoses were assessed retrospectively; however, symptom data were assessed prospectively, and symptom and diagnostic data converged.

To date, the biological mechanisms contributing to their strong association remain largely unknown. In this review, we critically analyze preclinical literature on psychostimulant drugs and reconsider the common view that depression is a risk factor for drug use and the development of SUD. Unexpectedly, this investigation led us to conclude that depressive-like states in rodents are associated with a low predisposition to drug intake, at least when considering initial, voluntary and regulated psychostimulant intake. We identified several conceptual gaps and methodological challenges potentially misleading when modeling depression and SUD comorbidity. On the basis of these observations, we propose new innovative perspectives to guide future experiments and advance our knowledge in this field, including the use of newly refined rodent models that better capture hallmarks of depression and SUD.Cerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectCerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma D-serine levels were measured.Cerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectD-serine contents were unaltered in major depression (MDD) relative to control.Cerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectCSF D-serine levels were significantly correlated with severity of MDD.Cerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectHVA levels showed a significant correlation with D-serine contents in CSF of MDD.Cerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectCSF D-serine levels might serve as biomarkers for MDD severity.Cerebrospinal fluid D-serine concentrations in major depressive disorder negatively correlate with depression severity - ScienceDirectD-serine is an endogenous co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and plays an important role in glutamate neurotransmission.

Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score.Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectSixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses.Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectThe searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses.Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectBaseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested.Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Functional connectivity of the left DLPFC to striatum predicts treatment response of depression to TMS - ScienceDirectFunctional connectivity of the left DLPFC to striatum predicts treatment response of depression to TMS - ScienceDirectReduced frontostriatal functional connectivity was observed in depressed vs. healthy subjects.Functional connectivity of the left DLPFC to striatum predicts treatment response of depression to TMS - ScienceDirectHigher DLPFC-striatal functional connectivity at baseline correlated with better TMS response.Functional connectivity of the left DLPFC to striatum predicts treatment response of depression to TMS - ScienceDirectDLPFC-striatal functional connectivity is a candidate predictive biomarker for TMS response.Functional connectivity of the left DLPFC to striatum predicts treatment response of depression to TMS - ScienceDirectRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, safe, and efficacious treatment for depression.

It has been proposed that chronically depressed persons have profoundly impaired empathic abilities in comparison to episodically depressed persons, and that specifically they exhibit a deficit in cognitive empathy, but not in affective empathy, a pattern also reported in ASD. This study aimed to explore autistic traits and empathy deficits in chronic depression, and identify specific differences to episodic depression.Autistic traits and empathy in chronic vs. episodic depression - ScienceDirectAutistic traits and multimodal empathy were assessed in chronically depressed patients (n=59), episodically depressed patients (n=40), and a healthy control group (n=55) using standardized questionnaires.Autistic traits and empathy in chronic vs. episodic depression - ScienceDirectRegardless of the disorder's chronicity, depressed patients exhibited higher levels of autistic traits and lower levels of perspective-taking than healthy controls. Chronically depressed patients reported significantly higher impairment in social skills and higher levels of personal distress in social interactions than episodic patients.Autistic traits and empathy in chronic vs. episodic depression - ScienceDirectOur results suggest that patients with chronic depression share two distinct characteristics, namely lower levels of social skills and higher levels of distress in tense social situations than patients with episodic depression. Future studies will need to determine whether the elevated autistic traits in chronic depression are specific to chronic depression, or represent the general tendency to withdraw from social situations. We conclude that chronically depressed patients are not specifically impaired in understanding another person's state of mind, but are unable to deal with another person's suffering or negative affective state.Autistic traits and empathy in chronic vs. episodic depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectFamily-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectThere is currently little evidence base for treatment of depressive disorders in childhood.Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectA family-based treatment may be optimal in addressing the interpersonal problems and symptoms frequently evident among depressed children.Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectFamily-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression (FFT-CD), a 15-session intervention, family is described in detail.Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectThree cases illustrating the FFT-CD treatment protocol are provided and common themes/challenges in treatment are described.Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectFamily-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression: Model and Case Illustrations - ScienceDirectThe current work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health: MH082861, PI: Martha C.

Collaborative care is an evidence-based patient-centered, integrated, system-level approach to improving the quality and outcomes of depression care. We describe the development of and randomized controlled trial testing a novel intervention, MS Care, which uses a collaborative care model to improve the care of depression and chronic pain in a MS specialty care setting.Improving the quality of depression and pain care in multiple sclerosis using collaborative care: The MS-care trial protocol - ScienceDirectImproving the quality of depression and pain care in multiple sclerosis using collaborative care: The MS-care trial protocol - ScienceDirectWe hypothesize that participants randomly assigned to MS Care will demonstrate significantly greater control of both pain and depression at post-treatment (primary endpoint) relative to those assigned to usual care. Secondary analyses will examine quality of care, patient satisfaction, adherence to MS care, and quality of life. Study findings will aid patients, clinicians, healthcare system leaders, and policy makers in making decisions about effective care for pain and depression in MS healthcare systems.

Because of these demonstrated relationships, it can be hypothesized that dysfunctional emotion regulation is a mediator of the association between childhood trauma and depression.Emotion regulation mediates the effect of childhood trauma on depression - ScienceDirectTo test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as depression lifetime persistency (i.e., lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).Emotion regulation mediates the effect of childhood trauma on depression - ScienceDirectBootstrapping-enhanced mediation analyses indicated that deficits in general emotion regulation mediated the association of childhood trauma to both depression severity and depression lifetime persistency. Further exploratory analyses indicated that specific emotion regulation skills (such as the ability to mindfully observe, accept, and tolerate undesired emotions or the willingness to voluntarily confront situations that prompt negative emotions in order to attain personally relevant goals) significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and depression severity. Willingness to confront was a mediator for both depression outcomes (depression severity and lifetime persistency).Emotion regulation mediates the effect of childhood trauma on depression - ScienceDirectThe employed mediation analyses are cross-sectional in nature, which limits any firm conclusions regarding causality.Emotion regulation mediates the effect of childhood trauma on depression - ScienceDirectThe findings support the assumption that a sophisticated emotion regulation may help prevent the onset or unfavorable course of depression in individuals who have experienced childhood trauma.Emotion regulation mediates the effect of childhood trauma on depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression, sleep problems, and perceived stress among informal caregivers in 58 low-, middle-, and high-income countries: A cross-sectional analysis of community-based surveys - ScienceDirectDepression, sleep problems, and perceived stress among informal caregivers in 58 low-, middle-, and high-income countries: A cross-sectional analysis of community-based surveys - ScienceDirectApproximately one fifth of the adult population in the 58 countries studied were engaged in informal care.Depression, sleep problems, and perceived stress among informal caregivers in 58 low-, middle-, and high-income countries: A cross-sectional analysis of community-based surveys - ScienceDirectCaregivers were more likely to have depression, sleep problems, and higher levels of perceived stress.Depression, sleep problems, and perceived stress among informal caregivers in 58 low-, middle-, and high-income countries: A cross-sectional analysis of community-based surveys - ScienceDirectInterventions and policies to address the mental health burden of caregivers are indispensable.Depression, sleep problems, and perceived stress among informal caregivers in 58 low-, middle-, and high-income countries: A cross-sectional analysis of community-based surveys - ScienceDirectDepression in the School-Aged Child With Type 1 Diabetes: Implications for Pediatric Primary Care Providers - ScienceDirectDepression is a common comorbid condition experienced by children with type 1 diabetes that, if undiagnosed, can lead to deterioration in glycemic control and other serious health complications.

During this task, participants were instructed to reappraise their negative emotions elicited by International Affective Picture System images (IAPS). In addition, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Strategies Scale (DERS) was used to assess participants' emotion dysregulation levels.Neural activation during cognitive reappraisal in girls at high risk for depression - ScienceDirectBoth RSK and CTL individuals show increased amygdala activation in response to negative emotional stimuli, however no difference was found between groups in using cognitive reappraisal strategies and functions of brain regions implicated in cognitive reappraisal. Interestingly, our psychometric test results indicate that high risk individuals are characterised by lower perceived emotional clarity (EC).Neural activation during cognitive reappraisal in girls at high risk for depression - ScienceDirectResults of the current study suggest depression vulnerability may not be linked to the effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal.

However, unlike memory research, previous attention research has not systematically examined the potential role of referential processing focus. The present study tested the hypothesis that evidence of depression-linked attentional avoidance of positive information would be more readily obtained following the self-referential processing of such information. We assessed attentional responding to positive information (and also to negative information) using a dot-probe procedure, after this information had been processed either in a self-referential or other-referential manner. The findings lend support to the hypothesis under scrutiny. Participants scoring high in depression score exhibited reduced attention to positive information compared to those scoring low in depression score, but only when this information had been processed in a self-referential manner. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms that underpin attentional selectivity in depression, while potentially also helping to account for inconsistencies in previous literature.Adjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectAdjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectThe study explored the adjuvant role of quercetin with levetiracetam for combined treatment of epilepsy and depression.Adjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectNeurochemical changes suggested altered tryptophan metabolism to be responsible for depression associated with epilepsy.Adjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectLevetiracetam treatment decreased seizure severity and further worsened the comorbid depression.Adjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectAdjuvant quercetin supplementation restored normal tryptophan and ameliorated comorbid depression.Adjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectQuercetin supplementation with levetiracetam seems effective approach for combined management of epilepsy and depression.Adjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectAdjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (143KB)Download full-size imageAdjuvant quercetin therapy for combined treatment of epilepsy and comorbid depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectPrevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectA prevalence of maternal depression among primipara peaked at two weeks postpartum.Prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectDifferences in trends of the EPDS factor scores by parity were observed.Prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectAlmost the same factor structure has been confirmed from prenatal to postnatal period.Prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectPrevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectPrevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectPrevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study - ScienceDirectEach factor score was not weighted; instead, we simply added up the item scores ranging from 0 to 3 for each question.

Results revealed that the scores of perceived stress and sleep quality were positively correlated with Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score. Sense of uncontrol, sense of nervous, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction were identified as significant predictors of depression among the elderly. The effect of perceived stress on depression was partly mediated by sleep quality.The mediating role of sleep quality on the relationship between perceived stress and depression among the elderly in urban communities: a cross-sectional study - ScienceDirectOur study reveals that not all dimensions of sleep quality are relevant factors affecting depression in the elderly, and there may be partial mediation effects of sleep quality, mainly through sleep duration and daytime dysfunction, within the impact of perceived stress on depression. This signifies that coping with perceived stress can be expected to ameliorate the severity of depression in the elderly by the intermediary role of sleep quality as well as the direct effect.

Social anxiety disorder is unique among the anxiety disorders in sharing an affective profile with depression, characterized by low levels of positive affect (PA) and high levels of negative affect (NA). Yet it remains unclear how this shared affective profile contributes to the covariation of social anxiety and depressive symptoms. We examined whether self-reported PA and NA accounted for unique variance in the association between social anxiety and depressive symptoms across three groups (individuals with remitted bipolar disorder, type I [BD; n = 32], individuals with remitted major depressive disorder [MDD; n = 31], and nonpsychiatric controls [n = 30]) at baseline and follow-ups of 6 and 12 months. Low levels of PA, but not NA, accounted for unique variance in both concurrent and prospective associations between social anxiety and depression in the BD group; in contrast, high levels of NA, but not PA, accounted for unique variance in concurrent and prospective associations between social anxiety and depression in the MDD group. Limitations include that social anxiety and PA/NA were assessed concurrently and all measurement was self-report. Few individuals with MDD/BD met current diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder. There was some attrition at follow-up assessments. Results suggest that affective mechanisms may contribute to the high rates of co-occurrence of social anxiety and depression in both MDD and BD. Implications of the differential role of PA and NA in the relationship between social anxiety and depression in MDD and BD and considerations for treatment are discussed.Positive and Negative Affect as Links Between Social Anxiety and Depression: Predicting Concurrent and Prospective Mood Symptoms in Unipolar and Bipolar Mood Disorders - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Positive and Negative Affect as Links Between Social Anxiety and Depression: Predicting Concurrent and Prospective Mood Symptoms in Unipolar and Bipolar Mood Disorders - ScienceDirectAmanda S.

A total of 36 meta-analyses were identified that met inclusion criteria for this review. In most cases, medium-to-large effect sizes for treatment reduction were observed when CBT was compared to non-active control conditions. Small-to-medium effects were observed when CBT was compared to active control treatments. The available meta-analyses generally did not examine, or data were not sufficient to evaluate, potential moderators of outcome, differential effects for parental involvement, or changes in quality of life or functional outcomes associated with treatment. Accordingly, while CBT should be broadly considered an effective treatment approach for childhood anxiety and depression, additional research is warranted in order to establish guidelines for service delivery for complicating factors in client presentation.Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for childhood anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rescue of glutamate transport in the lateral habenula alleviates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol-withdrawn rats - ScienceDirectRescue of glutamate transport in the lateral habenula alleviates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol-withdrawn rats - ScienceDirectGLT-1 function and expression are reduced in the LHb of ethanol-withdrawn rats.Rescue of glutamate transport in the lateral habenula alleviates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol-withdrawn rats - ScienceDirectCeftriaxone normalizes GLT-1 function and LHb activity of withdrawn rats.Rescue of glutamate transport in the lateral habenula alleviates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol-withdrawn rats - ScienceDirectCeftriaxone prevents depression- and anxiety-like behaviors of withdrawn rats.Rescue of glutamate transport in the lateral habenula alleviates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol-withdrawn rats - ScienceDirectIntra-LHb dihydrokainic acid attenuates ceftriaxone's effects on behaviors of rats.Rescue of glutamate transport in the lateral habenula alleviates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol-withdrawn rats - ScienceDirectAlcoholism and psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are often comorbid.

A systematic review of qualitative literature - ScienceDirectTo date global research on depression has used assessment tools based on research and clinical experience drawn from Western populations (i.e., in North American, European and Australian). There may be features of depression in non-Western populations which are not captured in current diagnostic criteria or measurement tools, as well as criteria for depression that are not relevant in other regions. We investigated this possibility through a systematic review of qualitative studies of depression worldwide. Nine online databases were searched for records that used qualitative methods to study depression. Initial searches were conducted between August 2012 and December 2012; an updated search was repeated in June of 2015 to include relevant literature published between December 30, 2012 and May 30, 2015. No date limits were set for inclusion of articles. A total of 16,130 records were identified and 138 met full inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 1976 and 2015. These 138 studies represented data on 170 different study populations (some reported on multiple samples) and 77 different nationalities/ethnicities. Variation in results by geographical region, gender, and study context were examined to determine the consistency of descriptions across populations. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare frequencies of features across region, gender and context. Seven of the 15 features with the highest relative frequency form part of the DSM-5 diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, many of the other features with relatively high frequencies across the studies are associated features in the DSM, but are not prioritized as diagnostic criteria and therefore not included in standard instruments. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of problems with concentration and psychomotor agitation or slowing were infrequently mentioned. This research suggests that the DSM model and standard instruments currently based on the DSM may not adequately reflect the experience of depression at the worldwide or regional levels.How is depression experienced around the world?

Thus, gaining a greater understanding of coping strategies that relate to depression and burnout can enhance the ability of medical schools to improve psychological wellbeing. The current study assesses how avoidance and decreased engagement in values-based behavior, key processes targeted in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, relate to depression and burnout in medical students. Method: A survey was sent to second-, third-, and fourth-year medical students at a large Midwestern university. Respondents (N = 241) completed self-report measures of depression, burnout (encompassing emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment), avoidance, and values-based behavior. Associations between variables were examined using bivariate correlations and regression analyses.Burnout and depression in medical students: Relations with avoidance and disengagement - ScienceDirectNearly 25% of the sample was experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms and 51% experiencing burnout. Greater avoidance and lower engagement in values-based behavior were associated with greater depressive symptoms, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization. In contrast, lower avoidance and higher values-based behavior were associated with greater personal accomplishment.Burnout and depression in medical students: Relations with avoidance and disengagement - ScienceDirectBurnout and depression were associated with avoidance and decreased engagement in values-based behavior.

We used descriptive statistics to understand patterns of use.Use of complementary and alternative medicines in people with depression and central obesity: Findings from a Tai Chi and Qigong study - ScienceDirectTwo hundred and sixty patients participated in the assessment. Half of the patients stated they were using CAM, on average reporting 2.3 CAM per patient. Women were more likely than men, and older people (>60 years) more likely than younger people (<40 years) to use any CAM products. Patients reported using CAM mostly for general health and alleviating aches and pains. CAM use was not associated with health state, use of a prescription antidepressant medicine, nor (self-reported) comorbidities such as arthritis, diabetes, hypertension or alcohol or tobacco use.Use of complementary and alternative medicines in people with depression and central obesity: Findings from a Tai Chi and Qigong study - ScienceDirectCAM products are commonly used in Australians with moderate depression, particularly in female or older patients. The range and number of CAM in this group with common comorbidity may present additional unknown risks due to potential interactions with other prescribed medications with a myriad of biological and pharmacological effects.

Seventy one depressed participants (scoring 14 and above on the Beck Depression Inventory II) completed tasks spanning three domains of possible negative interpretations: semantic ambiguity; nonverbal ambiguity and situational ambiguity. Regression analyses revealed that just under half of the variance in depressive symptom severity was explained by the combination of negative interpretation bias tasks, with the strongest predictor of depressive symptom severity being negative interpretation of semantic ambiguity when reading ambiguous text descriptions. Subsidiary group analyses confirmed that severely depressed individuals interpreted emotionally ambiguous information in a more negative way than did their mildly or moderately depressed counterparts. These findings indicate that the degree of negative interpretive bias is closely related to depression severity and that bias manifests especially strongly at the most severe levels of depression. Our findings may help us to refine cognitive theories of depression and be helpful in guiding therapy.Magnitude of negative interpretation bias depends on severity of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Denan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectDenan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectOlongbulak Structure Zone is a northeast-directed and southwest-dipping thrust zone.Denan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectDenan Depression is controlled by Olongbulak Thrust at its southern boundary.Denan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectTectonics in northeastern Qaidam basin significantly intensified during Quaternary.Denan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectThe northern slope of the Denan Depression is a passive margin.Denan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectEastern segment of the northern Qaidam basin is different from its western segment.Denan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectDenan Depression controlled by northeast-directed Olongbulak Thrust Zone in northeastern Qaidam basin: Implications for growth of northern Tibetan Plateau - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectInflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectStress, obesity, gut flora, diet, and genetics can increase inflammation.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectVulnerability to inflammation can result from decreased neurotrophic support.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectOther vulnerabilities include sleep quality, fatty acids, and genetics.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectIn vulnerable people, this leads to effects on monoamines and glutamatergic systems.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectThis can potentially result in inflammatory-cytokine associated major depression.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Neuroimmunology in Health And Disease.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Neuroimmunology in Health And Disease.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectInflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Neuroimmunology in Health And Disease.Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression in Diabetic Retinopathy: A Review and Recommendation for Psychiatric Management - ScienceDirectDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and one of the main causes of irreversible vision impairment in the working-age population. Multiple studies have demonstrated the significantly high prevalence of depression in patients with DR in recent years. The progression of DR could lead to depression, whereas depressive symptoms often worsen the condition of DR. Therefore, DR is one of the causes of psychosomatic diseases, the treatment for which should combine traditional DR therapy with depression interventions.Depression in Diabetic Retinopathy: A Review and Recommendation for Psychiatric Management - ScienceDirectWe reviewed existing articles that investigated the association between DR and depression in the context of prevalence, risk factors, biological mechanisms, and treatment indications.Depression in Diabetic Retinopathy: A Review and Recommendation for Psychiatric Management - ScienceDirectThe literature review in this article includes a brief introduction to current studies of depression and DR, followed by a focus on the epidemiology of depression in DR that help doctors better identify potential or existing depression patients upon first diagnosis.

Participants (n=223) were research volunteers who served in the US military since September 11, 2001, and denied a history of significant brain injuries. Depression was measured using a structured interview, the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Outcomes included performance on 10 processing speed variables. Invalid performance/report accounted for significant variance for 8 of 10 processing speed measures. There was not a consistent pattern of slowed processing speed in those with current depressive diagnoses compared to those without. However, depression symptom burden per the PAI Depression scale was significant for 7 of 10 processing speed tests. Only non-dominant fine motor dexterity was significantly slower in those with high versus low burden using BDI-II quartiles. Thus, the motor slowing hypothesis was supported, but only for depression burden and not diagnostic status or high versus low categorical classification. These results underscore the importance of validity assessment and consideration of how one measures psychiatric constructs when evaluating relations among symptoms and cognition.Evaluating the motor slowing hypothesis of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression and quality of life in older adults: Mediation effect of sleep quality - ScienceDirectBackground/Objective: Sleep insufficiency, which affects more than 45% of the world's population, has a great importance when considering older adults. Thus, this research tested a mediation hypothesis, through a path analysis, which explains how depression relates to the quality of life considering the effects of sleep quality in older adults. Method: A sample of 187 community-dwelling Portuguese older adults answered questionnaires about sociodemographic status (age, gender, highest level of education completed, family status, sports activities, health, and retirement status), quality of life, sleep quality, and depression. Descriptive and path analysis statistics were performed considering the results of the normality test. Results: The sample has health characteristics and presents adequate sleep duration. Sleep quality acted as a mediator between depression and the quality of life in older adults, considering the variation of gender and health. This suggests that it is important to establish self-care practices, namely sleep quality, to intervene in the ageing process. Conclusions: It is important to consider sleep quality associated with depression for older adults and to test interventions to minimize health impacts. Also, more researches are needed about the primary prevention in sleep quality relating to depression.Depression and quality of life in older adults: Mediation effect of sleep quality - ScienceDirectPrevalence of paternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum: An updated meta-analysis - ScienceDirectPrevalence of paternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum: An updated meta-analysis - ScienceDirectPaternal depression is common during the transition to parenthood.Prevalence of paternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum: An updated meta-analysis - ScienceDirectRates are conditional on measurement method, study location, publication year, and rates of maternal depression.Prevalence of paternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum: An updated meta-analysis - ScienceDirectPrevalence was not moderated by paternal sociodemographic factors.Prevalence of paternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum: An updated meta-analysis - ScienceDirectScreening policies are recommended especially when maternal depression is present.Prevalence of paternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum: An updated meta-analysis - ScienceDirectResearch in paternal prenatal and postpartum depression has nearly doubled since prevalence rates were last meta-estimated in October 2009.

While longitudinal studies have observed that adolescents suffer more severe symptoms of depression/anxiety when PLEs persist, it remains unclear whether depression/anxiety worsens or improves with PLE emergence or remission, respectively. In this prospective school-based study, we investigated the association between longitudinal changes in depression/anxiety and one-year PLE trajectories in adolescence.The association between changes in depression/anxiety and trajectories of psychotic-like experiences over a year in adolescence - ScienceDirectNine hundred and twelve adolescents participated in the baseline assessment of PLEs and depression/anxiety; 887 (97.3%) adolescents completed the follow-up assessment one year later. Multilevel analysis was conducted to evaluate the change in depression/anxiety, evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), during the year according to PLE trajectory, adjusting for baseline depression/anxiety, gender, age, substance use and victimization.The association between changes in depression/anxiety and trajectories of psychotic-like experiences over a year in adolescence - ScienceDirectThe association between changes in depression/anxiety and trajectories of psychotic-like experiences over a year in adolescence - ScienceDirectGreater awareness about PLEs and their trajectories in school health care settings may be a key towards the prevention and treatment of adolescent depression and anxiety.The association between changes in depression/anxiety and trajectories of psychotic-like experiences over a year in adolescence - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Evaluating shale oil in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, using the oversaturation zone method - ScienceDirectEvaluating shale oil in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, using the oversaturation zone method - ScienceDirectThe shale characteristics were introduced in Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China.Evaluating shale oil in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, using the oversaturation zone method - ScienceDirectAssessments of shale oil were performed using OSI and OSZ.Evaluating shale oil in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, using the oversaturation zone method - ScienceDirectThe suggestions and distribution were given for shale oil exploration.Evaluating shale oil in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, using the oversaturation zone method - ScienceDirectIncreasing energy demands resulting in the need for unconventional shale oil-gas resources are attracting ever more attention. However, although some studies have been conducted on unconventional shale oil resources, little work to date has been carried out on the potential of lacustrine mudstones and shale. In the Dongying Depression of the Bohai Bay Basin, China, significant amounts of oil have been recorded from more than one hundred wells, and flow has been verified in more than ten during conventional petroleum exploration. Because three boreholes aimed at exploring for shale oil have recently been drilled in this depression, we describe here the characteristics of lacustrine mudstones and shale and provide a preliminary assessment of the three wells using the oil sorption index and the oversaturation zone. The results of this study show that the three wells exhibit good potential for shale oil and further suggestions for exploration are presented. We also discuss a number of unusual phenomena discovered in these shale borehole profiles as well as future predictions for the potential distribution of shale oil.Evaluating shale oil in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, using the oversaturation zone method - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The effect of anxiety and depression on the risk of irritable bowel syndrome in migraine patients - ScienceDirectThe effect of anxiety and depression on the risk of irritable bowel syndrome in migraine patients - ScienceDirectMigraine is associated with an increased risk of developing IBS.The effect of anxiety and depression on the risk of irritable bowel syndrome in migraine patients - ScienceDirectThe risk is most significant in patients without mood disorders.The effect of anxiety and depression on the risk of irritable bowel syndrome in migraine patients - ScienceDirectIn patients with mood disorders, migraine does not additionally increase IBS risk.The effect of anxiety and depression on the risk of irritable bowel syndrome in migraine patients - ScienceDirectBidirectional co-morbidity between migraine and depression has been observed.

This research aimed to determine if a relationship existed between sleep problems in patients with schizophrenia and with depression and their reduced working memory (WM) performance. Thirty outpatients with schizophrenia, 30 outpatients with depression, and 30 healthy control participants were enrolled in this study. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire (i.e., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), two simple WM tasks tapping only its storage component (i.e., digit span forward and backward task), and two complex WM tasks tapping both its storage and processing components (i.e., letter-number sequencing and reading span task). The results showed that neither psychiatric group differed from the healthy controls on simple WM tasks. Patients with schizophrenia did not differ from those with depression in the performance of simple or complex WM tasks. However, patients with schizophrenia, and, to a lesser degree, patients with depression performed significantly worse than the healthy control participants on complex WM tasks, which was visible in lower WM scores for patients with depression and in slower information processing, as well, for patients with schizophrenia. Finally, a significant negative relationship was found between the PSQI score and the reading span task scores; thus, participants with worse performance tended to report more sleep problems. To conclude, sleep needs to receive more priority when treating patients with depression and especially patients with schizophrenia because better sleep improves (working) memory performance and daily functioning.Schizophrenia and depression: The relation between sleep quality and working memory - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The Relationship Between Gestational Diabetes and Antenatal Depression - ScienceDirectTo determine whether women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) had more symptoms of depression than women without GDM.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether clinical characteristics could serve as phenotypes informative of subsequent cognitive decline. Age at depression onset and antidepressant remission at 3 months (acute response) and 12 months (chronic response) were examined.Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes of Clinical Phenotypes of Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectIn a longitudinal study of late-life depression in an academic center, 273 depressed and 164 never-depressed community-dwelling elders aged 60 years or older were followed on average for over 5 years. Participants completed annual neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychological measures were converted to z-scores derived from the baseline performance of all participants. Cognitive domain scores at each time were then created by averaging z-scores across tests, grouped into domains of episodic memory, attention-working memory, verbal fluency, and executive function.Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes of Clinical Phenotypes of Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectDepressed participants exhibited poorer performance at baseline and greater subsequent decline in all domains. Early-onset depressed individuals exhibited a greater decline in all domains than late-onset or nondepressed groups. For remission, remitters and nonremitters at both 3 and 12 month exhibited greater decline in episodic memory and attention-working memory than nondepressed subjects. Three-month remitters also exhibited a greater decline in verbal fluency and executive function, whereas 12-month nonremitters exhibited greater decline in executive function than other groups.Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes of Clinical Phenotypes of Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectConsistent with past studies, depressed elders exhibit greater cognitive decline than nondepressed subjects, particularly individuals with early depression onset, supporting the theory that repeated depressive episodes may contribute to decline. Clinical remission is not associated with less cognitive decline.Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes of Clinical Phenotypes of Late-Life Depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Morphology Predicts Treatment Response to Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression - ScienceDirectRostral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (rACC and sgACC) activity and, to a lesser extent, volume have been shown to predict depressive symptom improvement across different antidepressant treatments. This study extends prior work by examining whether rACC and/or sgACC morphology predicts treatment response to Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for major depressive disorder. This is the first study to examine neural predictors of response to iCBT.Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Morphology Predicts Treatment Response to Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression - ScienceDirectRostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Morphology Predicts Treatment Response to Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression - ScienceDirectLarger pretreatment right rACC volume was a significant predictor of greater depressive symptom improvement in iCBT even when controlling for demographic (age, gender, race) and clinical (baseline depression, anhedonia, and anxiety) variables previously linked to treatment response.

In India, where access to mental health specialists is limited, little is known about the attitude of HIV clinicians toward depression in PLHIV.Attitudes of Indian HIV Clinicians Toward Depression in People Living with HIV - ScienceDirectWe administered a questionnaire to HIV clinicians attending the 2015 Chennai Antiretroviral Therapy Symposium that assessed respondents' level of agreement with 29 statements regarding the etiology, importance, and management of depression and whether they felt capable and willing to manage depression in PLHIV.Attitudes of Indian HIV Clinicians Toward Depression in People Living with HIV - ScienceDirectThe 69 respondents were from 9 Indian states. Most respondents agreed that depression in PLHIV is a serious problem (91%) and is associated with poorer HIV-related outcomes (62%-81%). Although most respondents (76%) reported feeling comfortable discussing mental health problems with PLHIV, almost half (48%) admitted that lack of knowledge and training about mental health issues hindered the diagnosis and treatment of depression in PLHIV. With few exceptions, there were no significant differences in responses by gender, urban/rural practice location, or government versus private practice.Attitudes of Indian HIV Clinicians Toward Depression in People Living with HIV - ScienceDirectIndian HIV clinicians believe that depression in PLHIV is important and are willing to manage depression in the HIV primary care setting. These findings suggest that HIV clinicians require further training to deliver evidence-based interventions to treat PLHIV with depression.Attitudes of Indian HIV Clinicians Toward Depression in People Living with HIV - ScienceDirectThis work was supported by Harvard Catalyst | The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center (National Center for Research Resources and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health Award KL2 TR001100, an appointed KL2/Catalyst Medical Research Investigator Training award) (Chan), National Institutes of Health P30AI06354 (Mayer), and unrestricted research grants from Merck, Gilead, and Bristol Meyers Squibb (Mayer).

Differential effects of metacognition on the relationship between parasympathetic inflexibility and symptoms of depression in a multi-wave study - ScienceDirectDepression often is characterized by inflexible autonomic and metacognitive processes that interfere with effective self-regulation. However, few studies have integrated these factors to improve the prediction of which individuals are at greatest risk for depression. Among 134 undergraduates, we evaluated whether parasympathetic inflexibility (a lack of reduction in respiratory sinus arrhythmia) in response to a sadness induction involving loss would prospectively predict symptoms of depression across four waves of follow-up over twelve weeks. Furthermore, we evaluated whether metacognitive components of perseverative cognition (PC) and decentering (identified by a principal component analysis) would moderate this relationship in opposite directions. Multilevel modeling demonstrated that the relationship between parasympathetic inflexibility and prospective symptoms of depression was exacerbated by PC, but attenuated by decentering. Furthermore, individuals with parasympathetic inflexibility, PC, and low decentering were at greatest risk for symptoms of depression across follow-up. These results support the utility of integrating autonomic and metacognitive risk factors to identify individuals at risk for depression.Perseverate or decenter?

There is a need for robust biomarkers which will help improve diagnosis and accelerate the drug discovery process. These are objective, peripheral physiological indicators whose presence can be used to predict the probability of onset or presence of depression, stratify according to severity or symptomatology, indicate prognosis and predict or track response to therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will address several issues pertaining to biomarkers in depression which will be grouped under the headings transcriptomic, proteomic, genomic and telomeric biomarkers. We will review some of the main pitfalls and also address ethical, moral and legal issues which relate to biomarker use in the clinic. We anticipate that in conjunction with initiatives such as the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), biomarkers will have a significant role to play in the psychiatric clinic in the years to come with a view to improving the lives of sufferers worldwide.Molecular biomarkers of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Neurocognitive impairment in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression - ScienceDirectTreatment of depression for individuals with type 2 diabetes improves depressive symptoms, but not glycemic control. For patients with depression and cognitive deficits, adherence to diabetes self-management goals may be especially challenging.Neurocognitive impairment in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression - ScienceDirectWe sought to examine whether neurocognitive dysfunction is associated with impaired diabetes adherence and control, examine the effect of depression, and determine if treatments of neurocognitive dysfunction improved glycemic control and perhaps even depression.Neurocognitive impairment in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression - ScienceDirectNeurocognitive impairment in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression - ScienceDirectDepression is a risk factor for greater morbidity in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Deficits in cognition and functional capacity are also risk factors and it is likely the case that they have separable influences upon diabetes-relevant outcomes. Support of both provider management, i.e., intensification of antidepressant or hypoglycemic medication dosing, and patient medication adherence, respectively, is associated with both improved glycemic control and depressive symptoms. To date, no studies have systematically identified the cognitive deficits of individuals with diabetes and utilized neuropsychological interventions to surmount such deficits in order to achieve improved glycemic control.Neurocognitive impairment in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression - ScienceDirectCognitive dysfunction, an important covariate in the relationship between depression and impaired diabetes self-management, can be precisely targeted.

Yet, until recently, most of the mechanistic studies shedding light on the molecular pathways involved in depression have focused on males, both animals and humans. It has been established that women have a more sensitive stress response, and that sex hormones contribute to depression onset. Recent genome-wide studies on human and mouse brain tissue have revealed that the overlap in the genes regulated by depression or chronic stress, respectively, between the sexes is surprisingly low. Such unbiased comprehensive screening approaches combined with advanced bioinformatics and in vivo validation studies enable identifying truly novel target genes that contribute to sex differences in depression susceptibility. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated sex bias in transgenerational passage of the effects of stress to the offspring. Elucidating the sex-specific mechanisms contributing to the development of depression can help design better diagnostic and therapeutic tools aimed at normalizing the unique abnormalities of each gender.The molecular basis for sex differences in depression susceptibility - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Other race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectOther race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectNeural correlates underlying the ORE is not well examined in mental health disorders.Other race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectWe investigated the impact of ORE on amygdala responses in major depression (MDD).Other race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectORE is associated with increased amygdala activations in both MDD and matched controls.Other race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectORE related amygdala responsivity may confound neural responses to facial stimuli.Other race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectThe implications of ORE on interpersonal functioning in MDD require further study.Other race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectOther race effect on amygdala response during affective facial processing in major depression - ScienceDirectParticipants were 30 individuals with major depression (mean age 39.4 years) and 23 healthy individuals (mean age: 38.8 years) recruited from the community.

It is unclear how ingroup perception can influence stress appraisals in performance situations among people with a history of depression who are currently in remission. We investigated the impact of ingroup perception on primary stress appraisal, i.e. how threatening a test situation is perceived, as well as on secondary stress appraisal, or perceived coping resources. Sixty people with a history of depression and currently in remission underwent computerized performance tests. Ingroup perception (group identification, group value and entitativity) and stress appraisals were assessed by self-report. In multiple linear regressions higher group identification predicted stronger perception of the situation as stressful if participants perceived people with depression as a coherent group (high entitativity) and held this group in low regard (low group value). In turn, stronger group identification was related to more perceived coping resources especially if participants did not regard people with depression as a coherent group. Our findings highlight the relevance of ingroup perception for stress and coping processes in people with a history of depression.Social identity shapes stress appraisals in people with a history of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Obstetric risk factors for depression during the postpartum period in South Korea: a nationwide study - ScienceDirectObstetric risk factors for depression during the postpartum period in South Korea: a nationwide study - ScienceDirectWomen with postpartum depression do not seek treatment immediately.Obstetric risk factors for depression during the postpartum period in South Korea: a nationwide study - ScienceDirectObstetric complications and comorbidity during pregnancy increase depression prevalence rate.Obstetric risk factors for depression during the postpartum period in South Korea: a nationwide study - ScienceDirectPrevious depression is the strongest risk factor in our study.Obstetric risk factors for depression during the postpartum period in South Korea: a nationwide study - ScienceDirectPostpartum depression is related to many adverse effects in both mothers and their children; therefore, proper screening and early interventions are needed.

Recent studies indicate that impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia, caused by either intense inflammatory activation (e.g., following infections, trauma, stroke, short-term stress, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases) or by decline and senescence of these cells (e.g., during aging, Alzheimer's disease, or chronic unpredictable stress exposure), can lead to depression and associated impairments in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Accordingly, some forms of depression can be considered as a microglial disease (microgliopathy), which should be treated by a personalized medical approach using microglial inhibitors or stimulators depending on the microglial status of the depressed patient.Depression as a Microglial Disease - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Longitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectLongitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectWe used an emotion regulation fMRI task to study cognitive behavioral therapy.Longitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectParticipants with major depression scanned pre- and post-treatment.Longitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectTreatment outcome scales with changes in emotion regulation-dependent BOLD signal.Longitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectRegions identified have been associated with emotion regulation in normative sample.Longitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectThe findings suggest a possible neural target for future treatment interventions.Longitudinal effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression on the neural correlates of emotion regulation - ScienceDirectCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for a substantial minority of patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), but its mechanism of action at the neural level is not known. As core techniques of CBT seek to enhance emotion regulation, we scanned 31 MDD participants prior to 14 sessions of CBT using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a task in which participants engaged in a voluntary emotion regulation strategy while recalling negative autobiographical memories. Eighteen healthy controls were also scanned. Twenty-three MDD participants completed post-treatment fMRI scanning, and 12 healthy volunteers completed repeat scanning without intervention. Better treatment outcome was associated with longitudinal enhancement of the emotion regulation-dependent BOLD contrast within subgenual anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, and lingual gyrus. Baseline emotion regulation-dependent BOLD contrast did not predict treatment outcome or differ between MDD and control groups. CBT response may be mediated by enhanced downregulation of neural activity during emotion regulation; brain regions identified overlap with those found using a similar task in a normative sample, and include regions related to self-referential and emotion processing. Future studies should seek to determine specificity of this downregulation to CBT, and evaluate it as a treatment target in MDD.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectAutonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectAsignificant proportion of MDD patients have a delayed maximum gastric emptying time.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectA significant percentage of MDD patients have an extended gastric half emptying time.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectThere was a significant negative correlation between the severity of MDD and Tmax.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectThe duration of MDD had no influence over the gastric emptying parameters.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectPatients with MDD and gastrointestinal complaints had no prolonged gastric motility.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectPatients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) often complain about somatic symptoms. Cardiac complaints have been examined predominantly. However, gastrointestinal complaints are also reported frequently and are associated with worse outcomes. The research concerning changes in gastric motility of these patients is rather sparse. The aim of our study was to determine dysfunction of gastric motility and gastrointestinal symptoms in MDD. The duration and severity of MDD were examined regarding its influence over gastric emptying.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectGastric emptying was determined by a 13C-acetate breath test in patients with MDD (n = 29) and healthy control subjects (n = 51). Prior to this, depressive illness was operationalized using external and self-assessment scales (HAMD-21, MADRS, BDI, CGI). Whether the severity or duration of MDD influenced the gastric emptying parameters was examined using Spearman's correlation. In addition, autonomic complaints were recorded by means of an ANS score. Each ANS score item was determined using a Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test concerning the gastric emptying parameters.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectAutonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectAutonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectAutonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectGastrointestinal motility is significantly impaired in patients with MDD compared to healthy control subjects. Autonomic complaints were indicated frequently in MDD patients. The duration of MDD had no influence over the time of gastric emptying. There was a significant negative correlation between the severity of MDD and Tmax, indicating that the Tmax was reached earlier with the progression of MDD. The slowing of gastric motility in MDD patients is likely a result of a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.Autonomic dysfunction of gastric motility in major depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Free mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectFree mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectWide range of free android apps on depression for potential Indian users.Free mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectSignificant challenges for the users in selecting a depression app.Free mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectInfrequent explicit delineation of scope and limitations or initial screening.Free mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectInfrequent inclusion of guidance and support for managing suicidal crisis.Free mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectFree mobile apps on depression for Indian users: A brief overview and critique - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectReduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectCurrently depressed patients completed a rapid serial visual presentation task.Reduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectPatients with depression were less likely to detect the presence of happy faces than healthy participants.Reduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectDetection of sad expressions was similar in the patient and healthy comparison groups.Reduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectThe findings suggest that detection of positive stimuli may be impaired in depression.Reduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectIn patients with depression, negative biases have been reported in various cognitive domains, but few studies have examined whether even detection is affected, i.e. are depressed patients more likely to detect the presence of negative stimuli? This study compared detection of sad and happy faces in patients (n=17) and healthy participants (n=18) using an attentional blink task. Patients with depression detected significantly fewer happy faces than matched healthy participants, but for sad faces the group difference was non-significant. The results suggest that depression may affect the detection of positive stimuli.Reduced detection of positive expressions in major depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Challenges and Solutions for Depression Prevention Research: Methodology for a Depression Prevention Trial for Older Adults with Knee Arthritis and Emotional Distress - ScienceDirectChallenges and Solutions for Depression Prevention Research: Methodology for a Depression Prevention Trial for Older Adults with Knee Arthritis and Emotional Distress - ScienceDirectChallenges and Solutions for Depression Prevention Research: Methodology for a Depression Prevention Trial for Older Adults with Knee Arthritis and Emotional Distress - ScienceDirectAt baseline there were 99 patients with an average age of 71; 61.62% were women and 81.8% white.

Dysphoric (i.e., subclinically depressed) and nondysphoric participants worked on a cognitive task. Half the participants in each group expected the possibility to subscribe to a social exchange internet site. Effort mobilization during task performance was assessed by participants' cardiovascular reactivity. Confirming the predictions, nondysphoric participants in the social-reward condition had higher reactivity of pre-ejection period, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate, compared to the other three cells. In contrast, dysphoric participants' cardiovascular reactivity was generally low. These findings indicate that social-reward function is indeed impaired in subclinical depression.

We examine if and how a clinical depression label and treatment are employed when low mood occurs in everyday life, which enables us to analyze the extent and content of medicalization and brings to the fore the interactional mechanisms and cultural concerns that potentially drive medicalization. The analysis is based on 316 observations of everyday life in the Netherlands. We observed and recorded interactions in which low mood was spontaneously expressed.Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life - ScienceDirectOur paper shows that the clinical depression label resonates widely even if low mood is not fully medicalized. People de-medicalize low mood, and low mood can be un-medicalized. Our analysis thus suggests that dominance is not achieved, which nuances Horwitz and Wakefield's claim that the clinical category of depression has come to encompass all forms of low mood. Moreover, uncertainties about the meaning of low mood and about the depression label remain pragmatic concerns of everyday life.Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life - ScienceDirectThe cultural norm of happiness and active citizenship are very prominent in everyday life across medicalized and un-medicalized interactions. These norms thus seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for medicalization. While pragmatic concerns do not seem to trigger medicalization either, one specific type of concern is consistently related to medicalization: relational conflicts.Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life - ScienceDirectIn sum, the cultural construction of low mood is not dominated by a single medical approach; however, it mirrors the diversity and uncertainties within and around the medical field.Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectResting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectAt baseline, depressed adolescents exhibited reduced connectivity between amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectAt baseline, depressed adolescents showed reduced amygdala connectivity with ventromedial prefrontal cortex.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectMore positive baseline amygdala connectivity with insula was associated with reduced symptom severity three months later.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectIndictors of depression absence/presence are distinct from those associated with change in depression symptoms over time.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectThe incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) rises during adolescence, yet the neural mechanisms of MDD during this key developmental period are unclear. Altered amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been associated with both adolescent and adult MDD, as well as symptom improvement in response to treatment in adults. However, no study to date has examined whether amygdala RSFC is associated with changes in depressive symptom severity in adolescents.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectResting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectCompared to healthy controls, depressed adolescents showed reduced amygdala-based RSFC with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC).

Furthermore, these results suggest that the biomarkers of MDD presence are distinct from those associated with change in depression symptoms over time.Resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala and longitudinal changes in depression severity in adolescent depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Combined use of the postpartum depression screening scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications - ScienceDirectCombined use of the postpartum depression screening scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications - ScienceDirectIt is the first time to combined use the screening scales to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications.Combined use of the postpartum depression screening scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications - ScienceDirectThis study supports the high prevalence of risk factors for antenatal depression, and encourages the active screening and earlier identification.Combined use of the postpartum depression screening scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications - ScienceDirectThe results confirmed the positive relationship between the scores of the PDSS and the EPDS and suggest that the optimal cutoffs for detecting antenatal depression among each screening tool may be lower than generally recommended (i.e., standard) cutoffs.Combined use of the postpartum depression screening scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications - ScienceDirectThe purpose of the present study was to evaluate antenatal depression screening employing two scales: the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for the population of Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications. A convenience sample of 842 Chinese pregnant women with complications participated in this study. The PDSS total score correlated strongly with the EPDS total score (r=0.652, p=0.000). Each tool performed extremely well for detecting major and major/minor depressions with PDSS resulting in a better psychometric performance than EPDS (p<0.01). If combined use, the recommended EPDS cut-off score was 8/9 for major depression, at which the sensitivity (71.6%) and specificity (87.6%) were the best, and the recommended PDSS cut-off score was 79/80 for major depression, along with its best sensitivity (86.4%) and specificity (100%). The study concluded that EPDS and PDSS appear to be reliable assessments for major and minor depression among the Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications. Combined use of these tools should consider lower cutoff scores to reduce the misdiagnosis and improve the screening validity.Combined use of the postpartum depression screening scale (PDSS) and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) to identify antenatal depression among Chinese pregnant women with obstetric complications - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Affective and cognitive theory of mind in borderline personality disorder: The role of comorbid depression - ScienceDirectAffective and cognitive theory of mind in borderline personality disorder: The role of comorbid depression - ScienceDirectWe assessed theory of mind in BPD and co-morbid MD.Affective and cognitive theory of mind in borderline personality disorder: The role of comorbid depression - ScienceDirectWe found different theory of mind cognitive and affective abilities.Affective and cognitive theory of mind in borderline personality disorder: The role of comorbid depression - ScienceDirectBPD with co-morbid MD was more impaired than BPD alone.Affective and cognitive theory of mind in borderline personality disorder: The role of comorbid depression - ScienceDirectAffective and cognitive theory of mind in borderline personality disorder: The role of comorbid depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Somebody to lean on: Social relationships predict post-treatment depression severity in adults - ScienceDirectSomebody to lean on: Social relationships predict post-treatment depression severity in adults - ScienceDirectSupportive relationships play a key role in recovery from affective disorders.Somebody to lean on: Social relationships predict post-treatment depression severity in adults - ScienceDirectIn this study, greater access to social relationships predicted post-treatment depression severity.Somebody to lean on: Social relationships predict post-treatment depression severity in adults - ScienceDirectStrategies to increase social support during treatment may enhance clinical outcomes.Somebody to lean on: Social relationships predict post-treatment depression severity in adults - ScienceDirectSomebody to lean on: Social relationships predict post-treatment depression severity in adults - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Associations between alcohol-use and depression symptoms in adolescence: Examining gender differences and pathways over time - ScienceDirectSeveral studies examining alcohol use and depression in youth have focused on documenting prevalence of overlap, or temporal ordering in longitudinal samples. Fewer studies have examined pathways connecting alcohol use and depression over time. This study examined gender differences between depression and alcohol use across adolescence while examining peer and family pathways as possible mediators of effects. Data was collected longitudinally from 593 families from three urban public middle schools in the United States. Participants were recruited in 6th grade and followed through 9th grade. We examined gender differences using a nested model comparison approach. Results indicated the association between depression and alcohol use differs by gender. For males, depression and alcohol use were independent across adolescence, and no significant indirect pathways were observed. For females, bidirectional effects were found between alcohol use and depression, as well as an indirect effect from depression to alcohol use via peer deviance.Associations between alcohol-use and depression symptoms in adolescence: Examining gender differences and pathways over time - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Hypofunction of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression during verbal fluency task: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study - ScienceDirectHypofunction of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression during verbal fluency task: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study - ScienceDirectFrontotemporal hypoactivation by word production was observed in depression.Hypofunction of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression during verbal fluency task: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study - ScienceDirectBrain function of the lateral/medial frontal and temporal regions was investigated.Hypofunction of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression during verbal fluency task: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study - ScienceDirectLeft laterofrontal hypoactivation was observed in depression with mandatory symptoms.Hypofunction of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression during verbal fluency task: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study - ScienceDirectThe clinical usefulness of PHQ-9 was confirmed by the view of brain function.Hypofunction of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression during verbal fluency task: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study - ScienceDirectPrevious functional neuroimaging studies of depression have demonstrated frontotemporal dysfunction, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while patients perform working memory and language comprehension tasks.

However, evidence for leptin dysregulation in major depressive disorder (MDD) is conflicting. Inconclusive findings may be attributable to heterogeneity of MDD, aggregating biologically different subtypes. We examined the relationship of leptin with MDD, its common subtypes (typical and atypical), and clinical features.Leptin Dysregulation Is Specifically Associated With Major Depression With Atypical Features: Evidence for a Mechanism Connecting Obesity and Depression - ScienceDirectThe sample consisted of participants (aged 18 to 65 years) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety with current (n = 1062) or remitted (n = 711) MDD and healthy control subjects (n = 497).

To investigate the link between depression and the neural mechanisms of reward processing, we examined individual differences in personality.Neural mechanisms of reward processing associated with depression-related personality traits - ScienceDirectNeural mechanisms of reward processing associated with depression-related personality traits - ScienceDirectParticipants who scored high in reward sensitivity produced a relatively larger feedback-RewP. By contrast, participants who scored high in depression learned the contingencies for infrequently rewarded cue-response combinations relatively poorly, exhibited a larger SPN, and produced a smaller feedback-RewP, especially to outcomes following cue-response combinations that were frequently rewarded.Neural mechanisms of reward processing associated with depression-related personality traits - ScienceDirectThese results point to a primary deficit in reward valuation in individuals who score high in depression, with secondary consequences that impact reward learning and anticipation.Neural mechanisms of reward processing associated with depression-related personality traits - ScienceDirectDespite recent evidence arguing for an anticipatory deficit in depression, impaired reward valuation as a primary deficit should be further examined in clinical samples.Neural mechanisms of reward processing associated with depression-related personality traits - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectDepression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectDepression is common in SCAs and depressive symptoms do not progress over 2 years.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectSuicidal ideation is more prevalent in SCA3.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectThe effects of depression on ataxia progression vary across different SCA types.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectDepression has negative impact on functional status and quality of life in all SCAs, after accounting for ataxia progression.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectDepression is a common comorbidity in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) but its association with ataxia progression is not well understood.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectTo study the prevalence and influence of depressive symptoms in SCAs.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectWe studied 300 participants with SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly measured depressive symptoms by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) along with other clinical features including ataxia, functional status, and quality of life every 6 months for 2 years. We employed regression models to study the effects of depressive symptoms on clinical progression indexed by Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Part IV (UHDRS-IV) and EQ5D after adjusting for age, sex and pathological CAG repeats.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectComorbid depression is common in SCAs (26%). Although the baseline prevalence of depression was similar among different SCA types, suicidal ideation was more frequently reported in SCA3 (65%). Depressive symptoms were associated with SARA scores but did not significantly progress over time within 2 years or deteriorate by increased numbers of pathological CAG repeats. The effects of depression on ataxia progression varied across different SCA types. Nevertheless, depression had consistently negative and significant impact on functional status and quality of life in all SCAs, even after accounting for ataxia progression.Depression and clinical progression in spinocerebellar ataxias - ScienceDirectDepressive symptoms are not simply the consequence of motor disability in SCAs.

In typical infants, a classic still-face effect (SFE) has been confirmed whereby infants demonstrate reduced positive affect (PA), reduced gaze (GA), and increased negative affect (NA). Recently, the SFP has been used to examine the effect of maternal depression upon infant behaviour. However, the nature and consistency of the behavioural responses of infants of depressed mothers during the SFP remains unclear. In the current meta-analysis, we examined whether or not infants of depressed mothers demonstrate the classic SFE, as well as whether or not these infants display the same levels of PA, NA, and GA as their counterparts with non-depressed mothers. Results revealed that infants of depressed mothers display the classic SFE like infants of their non-depressed counterparts. However, infants of depressed mothers also demonstrated significantly higher levels of PA during the still-face episode. One potential interpretation of this finding is that infants prior experience of similar, depressed interactions with their mothers, encourages them to amplify their positive attachment signals in order to engage maternal attention and response. Alternatively, or additionally, infants of depressed mothers could be using PA in order to regulate their own NA.Mechanism of development of depression and probiotics as adjuvant therapy for its prevention and management - ScienceDirectProbiotics are in the spotlight of enteric neuroscience research that influences brain biochemistry, neural development and other behavioural phenomenon. Depression due to mood disorder, pathogenic infections/metabolic disorders, psychiatric illness, stressful life style, alters the function of neurochemicals. Out of various strategies, recent research has shown the mechanism of action of probiotics in alleviating mood disorders. Understanding the causes for depression and anxiety would pave way for the development of therapeutics to surmount the burden of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the present article emphasizes on the causes of generation of depression and possible strategies for their prevention and management through probiotics.Mechanism of development of depression and probiotics as adjuvant therapy for its prevention and management - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mechanism of development of depression and probiotics as adjuvant therapy for its prevention and management - ScienceDirectSearch criteria: Cited articles in the present review have been retrieved from various search engines like Google scholar, Science Direct and pubMed using Boolean Search.

Cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training has been shown to decrease depression, psychological stress, and mortality after a coronary heart disease event. The presence of depression at completion of cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training is associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if depression with comorbid psychological risk factors such as anxiety or hostility confers an additional mortality disadvantage. We evaluated the mortality effect of anxiety and hostility on depression after cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training.Significance of Comorbid Psychological Stress and Depression on Outcomes After Cardiac Rehabilitation - ScienceDirectSignificance of Comorbid Psychological Stress and Depression on Outcomes After Cardiac Rehabilitation - ScienceDirectSignificance of Comorbid Psychological Stress and Depression on Outcomes After Cardiac Rehabilitation - ScienceDirectAfter cardiac rehabilitation, depression, when present, is usually associated with other forms of psychological stress, which confers additional mortality.

Previous work also highlights cognitive biases and deficits in cognitive control that accompany depression and suggestions have been made as to how cognitive and affective aspects of the disorder are linked. Recent work proposes that difficulties in the self-regulation of affect after experiencing negative life events may contribute to risk for the onset of depression, and indeed there is evidence that depressed patients exhibit more frequent use of maladaptive strategies when regulating affect and show difficulties effectively implementing adaptive strategies. Cognitive aspects of depression may play an important role in helping us understand these difficulties in self-regulation. This article reviews recent work on emotion regulation in depression and links cognitive biases and deficits associated with depression to difficulties in the self-regulation of emotion. Importantly, a main goal of the article is to identify topics in need of future attention that could greatly help shed light on the relation between cognition and emotion regulation in this and other psychological disorders.Examining emotion regulation in depression: A review and future directions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Exploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectExploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectThe mechanisms of change of CT and IPT for Depression are still largely unknown.Exploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectWe examined the temporal role of 5 candidate mechanisms in the context of an RCT.Exploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectOver the course of treatment, patients showed improvement on all measures.Exploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectNo between-treatment differences were observed from pre-to post-treatment.Exploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectWe found only little support for the respective theoretical models of change.Exploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectExploring mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy for adult depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectAge-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectOur systematic review found no significant evidence for more pronounced rTMS effects on executive functions in older than in younger adults.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectThe size of the executive function benefits from rTMS in depression was positively related to the effect size of mood symptom reduction.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectWe describe methods that may detect rTMS-driven remediation of both executive processing and mood in depressed patients in future.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectThe aims of the current review were to: 1) examine whether the rTMS effects on executive function increase as age advances; 2) to examine the potential of rTMS to remediate executive function in older depressed patients; and 3) to assess the relationship between the executive function and mood benefits from rTMS in depression.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectRandomized or matched-groups, blind, sham-controlled studies (12 studies, 347 participants) on excitatory rTMS applied to left DLPFC in depression were reviewed.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectA series of meta-regressions found no evidence of greater rTMS effects on executive functions as age advances. Similarly, meta-analyses showed no significant rTMS effects on executive functions in older depressed individuals. However, meta-regression analyses showed that the size of the executive function benefits from rTMS in depression are positively related to the effect size of mood symptom reduction. Despite its correlational nature, this finding is consistent with the idea that improvement in executive function may play a critical role in depression recovery.Age-Related Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Executive Function in Depression: A Systematic Review - ScienceDirectThe authors consider these findings preliminary because of the modest number of available studies.

The timing of the onset of this sex bias led us to hypothesize that ovarian hormones contribute to depression and anxiety during puberty. In humans, it is difficult to disentangle direct effects of gonadal hormones from social and environmental factors that interact with pubertal development to influence mental health. To test the role of gonadal hormones in anxiety- and depression-related behavior during puberty, we manipulated gonadal hormones in mice while controlling social and environmental factors. Similar to humans, we find that mice show an increase in depression-related behavior from pre-pubertal to late-pubertal ages, but this increase is not dependent on gonadal hormones and does not differ between sexes. Anxiety-related behavior, however, is more complex during puberty, with differences that depend on sex, age, behavioral test, and hormonal status. Briefly, males castrated before puberty show greater anxiety-related behavior during late puberty compared to intact males, while pubertal females are unaffected by ovariectomy or hormone injections in all assays except the marble burying test. Despite this sex-specific effect of pubertal hormones on anxiety-related behavior, we find no sex differences in intact young adults, suggesting that males and females use separate mechanisms to converge on a similar behavioral phenotype. Our results are consistent with anxiolytic effects of testicular hormones during puberty in males but are not consistent with a causal role for ovarian hormones in increasing anxiety- and depression-related behavior during puberty in females.Age, sex, and gonadal hormones differently influence anxiety- and depression-related behavior during puberty in mice - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Age, sex, and gonadal hormones differently influence anxiety- and depression-related behavior during puberty in mice - ScienceDirectContributed equally.Present temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectPresent temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectThe Dongpu depression exhibits a medium-temperature field.Present temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectThe geothermal field is controlled by the basement faults.Present temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectPresent temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectThe source rock thermal evolution is controlled by the paleo geothermal fields.Present temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectThe Dongpu depression is located between stable and active tectonic areas.Present temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectPresent temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectPresent temperature field and Cenozoic thermal history in the Dongpu depression, Bohai Bay Basin, North China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Are female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectAre female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectWe examined the relationship between maternal prenatal depression and child depression.Are female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectWe also investigated the interaction with child gender.Are female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectDepression risk at age 18 following prenatal maternal exposure is greater in girls.Are female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectDepression risk at age 18 following postnatal maternal exposure is greater in boys.Are female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectThe impact of maternal stress responses during pregnancy persist into adolescence.Are female children more vulnerable to the long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy? - ScienceDirectFemale fetuses are more vulnerable to high levels of maternal glucocorticoids.

There are a number of mechanisms by which anxiety could potentially influence the impact of headache on patient function, and this study highlights that anxiety could potentially be a trigger of headache activity.The relative importance of anxiety and depression in pain impact in individuals with migraine headaches - ScienceDirectThe findings thus suggest the possibility that treatments that focus on anxiety might be potentially more important for individuals with migraine than treatments that focus on depression, at least with respect to having a beneficial impact on the interference of headache with activity. Research is needed to evaluate the beneficial impact of anxiety treatment in individuals with migraine headaches. Clinicians should evaluate and consider treating, as appropriate and necessary, anxiety in patients with migraine.The relative importance of anxiety and depression in pain impact in individuals with migraine headaches - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Darwinian depression - ScienceDirectThe standard evolutionary explanation for depression is that being in an emotionally depressed state is adaptive.Darwinian depression - ScienceDirectThe article first undertakes a critical review of the extant literature. It then provides an alternative evolutionary explanation for event-based depression and elation. It argues that being in a depressed state is not adaptive (indeed, quite the opposite), but that the threat of depression for bad outcomes and the promise of pleasure for good outcomes are adaptive because they motivate the individual toward undertaking effort that increases fitness. The article then explains reasons for failure in the motivation system and the mood disorders that arise as a consequence.Darwinian depression - ScienceDirectDarwinian depression - ScienceDirectThe evolutionary explanation for depression does not directly provide clinical criteria for determining when major depressive disorder is present nor has it yet provided new treatment strategies for mood disorders.Darwinian depression - ScienceDirectThe theory presented here provides a coherent explanation for depression and elation and leads research in a different direction from previous evolutionary explanations.Darwinian depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Actor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectActor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectIn MDD patients and caregivers report anxious and depressive symptoms.Actor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectActor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectActor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectInterventions on emotional intelligence and coping strategies could be proposed.Actor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectActor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression - ScienceDirectThe cross-sectional study included 79 MDD patient-caregiver dyads.

Human and animal experiments have demonstrated that tDCS promotes brain plasticity and have suggested that this consequence may underlie its therapeutic benefits. Nonetheless, the specific neurobiological underpinnings of tDCS-induced brain plasticity have only recently begun to be investigated. While brain plasticity occurs in synapses formed by neurons, astrocytes, a major glial cell type, have recently been shown to support synaptic plasticity via intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In this perspective article, we discuss our recent results demonstrating that tDCS induces the activation of astrocytic calcium signaling that constitutes a required component for treating chronic restraint stress-induced depressive mice. We put forward the notion that activation of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling could be used clinically as a potent remedy for depression.The effects of vitamin B on the immune/cytokine network and their involvement in depression - ScienceDirectThe effects of vitamin B on the immune/cytokine network and their involvement in depression - ScienceDirectLow levels of vitamin B (B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12) are common in patients with depression.The effects of vitamin B on the immune/cytokine network and their involvement in depression - ScienceDirectVitamin B supplementation has been shown to improve depression outcomes.The effects of vitamin B on the immune/cytokine network and their involvement in depression - ScienceDirectThe immune system plays a fundamental role in maintaining health.

The current study examined whether changes in parents' depression would mediate the relationship between income dynamics and youth development changes in South Korea. The participants were 561 families who had completed the Korean Welfare Panel Study at three time points that covered the full span from elementary to high school. A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that 1) family income was associated with parental depression and youth aggression over time and 2) early parental depression fully mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent youth aggression rates over time. These findings have major implications for policies and interventions with regard to low-income South Korean families.Preconception gynecological risk factors of postpartum depression among Japanese women: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectPreconception gynecological risk factors of postpartum depression among Japanese women: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectPreconception endometriosis, and menstrual problems are risk factors of postpartum.Preconception gynecological risk factors of postpartum depression among Japanese women: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectThis is the first study, in Japanese women, to show this association.Preconception gynecological risk factors of postpartum depression among Japanese women: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectThe association was constant after adjustment for a wide variety of known risk factors.Preconception gynecological risk factors of postpartum depression among Japanese women: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectTo assess those morbidities would be valuable for prediction and intervention on PPD.Preconception gynecological risk factors of postpartum depression among Japanese women: The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) - ScienceDirectPostpartum depression is one of the major causes of disability among women who are on their childbearing years.

Both increased and decreased resting-state functional connectivity between the anterior and posterior DMN have been observed in depression. These conflicting connectivity differences necessitated further exploration of the resting-state DMN dysfunction in depression. Hence, we investigated the time-varying dynamic interactions within the DMN via functional connectivity microstates in a sub-second level. 25 patients with depression and 25 matched healthy controls were enrolled in the MEG analysis. Spherical K-means algorithms embedded within an iterative optimization frame were applied to sliding windowed correlation matrices, resulting in sub-second alternations of two functional connectivity microstates for groups and highlighting the presence of functional variability. In the power dominant state, depressed patients showed a transient decreased pattern that reflected inter/intra-subnetwork deregulation. A supplementary negatively correlated state simultaneously presented with increased connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), two core nodes for the anterior and posterior DMN respectively. Additionally, depressed patients stayed longer in the supplementary microstate compared to healthy controls. During the time spent in the supplementary microstate, an attempt to compensate for the aberrant effect of vmPFC on PCC across DMN subnetworks was possibly made to balance the self-related processes disturbed by the dominant pattern. The functional compensation mechanism of the supplementary microstate attached to the dominant disrupted one provided a possible explanation to the existing inconsistent findings between the anterior and posterior DMN in depression.A supplementary functional connectivity microstate attached to the default mode network in depression revealed by resting-state magnetoencephalography - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Electroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectElectroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectECT seems to modify the immuno-inflammatory response secondary to a de depression.Electroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectThere is an acute immuno-inflammatory response immediately following an ECT session.Electroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectIn the long term, ECT appears to result in a correction of the immuno-inflammatory imbalances found in depression.Electroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectElectroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectThe aim of this review is to survey the potential actions of ECT on the immuno-inflammatory cascade activated during depression.Electroconvulsive therapy, depression, the immune system and inflammation: A systematic review - ScienceDirectA systematic search of the literature was carried out, using the bibliographic search engines PubMed and Embase.

Patients frequently have difficulty in falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night and non-restorative sleep. Sleep abnormalities in depression are mainly characterized by increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced slow wave sleep. Among the mechanisms of sleep disturbances in depression are hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, CLOCK gene polymorphism and primary sleep disorders. The habenula is a structure regulating the activities of monoaminergic neurons in the brain. The hyperactivation of the habenula has also been implicated, together with sleep disturbances, in depression. The presence of depression in primary sleep disorders is common. Sleep disturbances treatment include pharmacotherapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression in pregnancy - ScienceDirectPerinatal depression is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality and may have long-term consequences on child development. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently recognized the importance of identifying and treating women with depression in the perinatal period. However, screening and accessing appropriate treatment come with logistical challenges. In many areas, there may not be sufficient access to psychiatric care, and, until these resources develop, the burden may inadvertently fall on obstetricians. As a result, understanding the risks of perinatal depression in comparison with the risks of treatment is important. Many studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy fail to control for underlying depressive illness, which can lead to misinterpretation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor risk by clinicians. This review discusses the risks and benefits of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in pregnancy within the context of perinatal depression. Whereas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be associated with certain risks, the absolute risks are low and may be outweighed by the risks of untreated depression for many women and their offspring.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression in pregnancy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression in pregnancy - ScienceDirectThe authors report no conflict of interest.Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectPrevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectUndiagnosed depression (occult depression) is highly prevalent.Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectAntidiabetic drugs are not associated with the presence of depression.Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectComplications related to diabetes are not associated with depression.Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectPerforming an active search of depression is recommended in type 2 diabetic patients.Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectTo estimate the prevalence of known and undiagnosed depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care setting in Spain, and to determine the factors associated with the presence of depression.Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes attended in primary care in Spain - ScienceDirectThis was a cross-sectional and multicenter study performed in a random sample of patients with type 2 diabetes attended in 21 primary care centers.

Variously championed as a condition of immunological, neurological, neurophysiological, psychiatric or psychological origin, consensus on a cogent and evidenced-based pathway has yet to be achieved. Irrespective of the ambiguity regarding aetiology, what is incontrovertible is the experience of significant depression, which often accompanies this most distressing clinical presentation. The current paper examines the potential underlying mechanisms, which may determine and explain this relationship between CFS and depression. In doing so, it offers some insights, which may be of value in the development of evidence-based and scientifically-anchored interventions in individuals experiencing this diagnosis, to improve outcomes in relation to depression specifically and quality of life more generally.The interface between chronic fatigue syndrome and depression: A psychobiological and neurophysiological conundrum - ScienceDirectThe interface between chronic fatigue syndrome and depression: A psychobiological and neurophysiological conundrum - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectReduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectGiven the prevalence of depression in females, female models are essential.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectAssessment of neural endpoints in nonhuman primates is valuable.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectVascularization of the brain is dynamic and responsive to the environment.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectMonkeys with depressive behavior have reduced vascularization of the hippocampus.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectVascular endpoints should be noted in assessments of neural substrates of behavior.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectDepression is a common and debilitating mood disorder that impacts women more often than men. The mechanisms that result in depressive behaviors are not fully understood; however, the hippocampus has been noted as a key structure in the pathophysiology of depression. In addition to neural implications of depression, the cardiovascular system is impacted. Although not as commonly considered, the cerebrovasculature is critical to brain function, impacted by environmental stimuli, and is capable of altering neural function and thereby behavior. In the current study, we assessed the relationship between depressive behavior and a marker of vascularization of the hippocampus in adult female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Similar to previously noted impacts on neuropil and glia, the depressed phenotype predicts a reduction in a marker of vascular length in the anterior hippocampus. These data reinforce the growing recognition of the effects of depression on vasculature and support further consideration of vascular endpoints in studies aimed at the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying depression.Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Attitudes towards menopause and depression, body image of women during menopause - ScienceDirectAttitudes towards menopause and depression, body image of women during menopause - ScienceDirectAim of the study was to investigate attitude towards menopause, body image and depression level of Turkish women in menopause.Attitudes towards menopause and depression, body image of women during menopause - ScienceDirectThe data of this descriptive and cross-sectional study were collected via questionnaire form, Attitude towards Menopause Scale (ATMS), Body Image Scale (BIS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).Attitudes towards menopause and depression, body image of women during menopause - ScienceDirect54.1% of women held negative attitudes towards this transition. The rate of women who fit the borderline evaluation for depression was 27.5%.

This paper reports the first empirical investigation of the goals and motivations of individuals experiencing persecutory delusions. Participants completed assessments of goals and motivations, depression and paranoia. Higher levels of depression were associated with more avoidant motivations and lower goal self-concordance, but not with numbers of approach motivations. More avoidant motivations were also associated with greater paranoia. The findings are consistent with proposals that avoidant and externally-motivated goal pursuit could contribute to symptom persistence.Depression, goals and motivations in people with persecutory delusions - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.The influence of prescription opioid use duration and dose on development of treatment resistant depression - ScienceDirectThe influence of prescription opioid use duration and dose on development of treatment resistant depression - ScienceDirectLonger opioid duration but not dose associated with new onset depressionThe influence of prescription opioid use duration and dose on development of treatment resistant depression - ScienceDirectTreatment resistant depression (TRD) is associated with more pain.The influence of prescription opioid use duration and dose on development of treatment resistant depression - ScienceDirectRisk of developing TRD increased with longer opioid use.The influence of prescription opioid use duration and dose on development of treatment resistant depression - ScienceDirectLonger opioid use, but not dose, associated with incident TRDThe influence of prescription opioid use duration and dose on development of treatment resistant depression - ScienceDirectLong-term prescription opioid use is associated both with new-onset and recurrence of depression.

Although the psychological sequelae of disasters can last for many years, the long-term sequelae and their risk factors tend to receive little research attention.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectThe objectives of the present study were to estimate the prevalences of symptomalogical PTSD and depression among survivors 8 years after the Wenchuan earthquake, and to identify the shared and unshared risk factors associated with PTSD and depression, using data from a cross-sectional survey.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirect1369 participants were recruited from two different sites in the areas that were severely affected by the earthquake. Symptomalogical PTSD was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The Chinese edition of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depression. Traumatic exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake was assessed using an exposure checklist designed by this study.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectEight years after the Wenchuan earthquake, 11.8% of the respondents had symptomalogical PTSD, and 24.8% of respondents had probable depression. The results also indicated that female gender, low education, poor perceived health, and traumatic experiences after the earthquake were associated with higher odds of both PTSD and depression among survivors. Direct exposure to the earthquake was associated with comorbid symptomalogical PTSD and depression (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.42, 2.44). Those having only depression were more likely to be unmarried/divorced/widowed, and to have experienced fear at the time of the earthquake (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.04, 1.72), while those with only symptomalogical PTSD were likely to be from the township of Yongan as opposed to Guangji (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.06, 3.31).Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectThis is a cross-sectional study, and thus is insufficient for determining causal relationships with regard to chronic PTSD or depression.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectThe results of this study indicate that symptomalogical PTSD and depression persist among many survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake, 8 eight years later. Objective earthquake exposure is associated with symptomalogical PTSD, while subjective exposure is associated with long-term depression.Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among adult survivors 8 years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectPortrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectWe studied 800 depression-focused Pinterest posts in a quantitative content analysis.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectDepression-themed pins elicited high response levels for repins, likes, and comments.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectDysfunctional coping strategy was found more often than other coping strategies.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectAbout 10% of all pins refer to thoughts of suicide.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectPR professionals should engage in depression-focused social media communication.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectUsing a quantitative content analysis, this study focused on how depression has been portrayed and communicated on Pinterest. Key findings include: Depression-focused pins elicited high response levels for repins, likes, and comments, and more than half of the pins expressed perception of depression as a severe disorder. Various coping mechanisms were present in the pins, with the dysfunctional coping strategy most prevalent. Implications for practitioners on how to utilize visual media platforms to effectively engage at-risk publics on health issues were discussed.Portrayals of depression on Pinterest and why public relations practitioners should care - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance - ScienceDirectAlthough chronic depression is associated with lower global functioning and poorer treatment response than episodic depression, little is known about the differences between these two forms of depression in terms of psychological factors. Thus, the present study aimed at differentiating chronic and episodic depression regarding cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance that have been proposed as important risk factors for depression and promising targets for the treatment of depression.Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance - ScienceDirectThirty patients with early onset chronic depression were compared with 30 patients with episodic depression and 30 healthy, never-depressed controls in terms of self-reported cognitive-behavioral (social and non-social) and emotional avoidance.Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance - ScienceDirectChronically depressed patients reported more avoidance than healthy controls in each of the measures. Moreover, they reported more cognitive-nonsocial and behavioral-nonsocial as well as behavioral-social and emotional avoidance (in the form of restricted emotional expression to others) than patients with episodic depression. This kind of emotional avoidance also separated best between chronically and episodically depressed patients. Furthermore, general emotion avoidance and behavioral-social avoidance were positively correlated with levels of depression in chronically depressed patients.Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance - ScienceDirectThe results are based on self-report data and should thus be interpreted with caution. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limits any causal conclusions.Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance - ScienceDirectThe findings underscore the relevance of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance in differentiating chronic from episodic depression and healthy controls and advocate a stronger focus on maladaptive avoidance processes in the treatment of chronic depression.Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Increased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectIncreased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectIn this case-control study we aimed at investigating BDNF levels in peripheral blood in healthy individuals with or without a family history of depression.Increased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectBlood BDNF protein concentrations were significantly higher in the individuals with a family history of depression.Increased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectSeasonality is important to consider i future studies of BDNF.Increased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectWe investigated peripheral BDNF in healthy with and without a family history of depression.Increased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectThe brain-derive neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play an important role in the course of depression. We aimed to study the associations between peripheral whole blood BDNF levels in healthy individuals with and without a family history of depression. BDNF levels were significantly increased in healthy individuals with (n = 76), compared with healthy individuals without (n = 39) a family history of depression and persisted after adjustment for age and gender differences. Higher BDNF levels were associated with increasing age and seasonality. A family history of depression may contribute to an elevation of peripheral BDNF levels in healthy individuals.Increased blood BDNF in healthy individuals with a family history of depression - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectMindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectAnxiety and depression are frequent complaints in primary care.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectMeditation or mindfulness strategies may help decrease health care costs and improve health outcomes for anxiety and depression.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectIn addition to Buddhist philosophy, the 2 main secular interventions of Western mindfulness are mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectMindfulness can be cultivated through a variety of practices, including meditation, body recognition, and yoga.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectNurse practitioners must ensure patient suitability before the initiation of mindfulness-based intervention.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectMindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Mindfulness: An Effective Prescription for Depression and Anxiety - ScienceDirectBoth authors are affiliated with the College of Nursing, Helen Glass Center for Nursing, at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.
