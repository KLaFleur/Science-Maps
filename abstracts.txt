This article examines the various labels used to classify cities and identifies the key characteristics that each label tends to highlight. It is contended that as proponents of variously labelled cities pursue certain aspects of sustainability, their focus may be too narrow to cover the broad spectrum of sustainability.TITLE Future cities: Conceptualizing the future based on a critical examination of existing notions of cities - ScienceDirectA literature review of various notions of desirable cities promoted under various labels suggests that cities of the future would need to be dynamic and intelligent in every aspect of social, economic and environmental sustainability. Therefore, it is important that all aspects of sustainability are considered in envisioning the desired future in which to conceptualize the cities of the future. It can be assumed from the past trends of urbanization that future cities will continue to uphold and build upon common goals and values of existing cities such as promoting pleasant urban form, community engagement, economic opportunities, and technological advancement and cultural diversity.TITLE Future cities: Conceptualizing the future based on a critical examination of existing notions of cities - ScienceDirectThis paper reports on a systematic critical review of literature of twelve popular notions/labels of desirable cities as apparent from a scan of citation indices of peer reviewed articles. It identifies the level of consideration of various aspects of sustainability in the central focus of proponents of each notion. It then maps out the concern for sustainability along ten dimensions of sustainability.TITLE Future cities: Conceptualizing the future based on a critical examination of existing notions of cities - ScienceDirectThe findings of the study demonstrate that not all notions/labels of desired cities consider sufficient breadth of the sustainability spectrum. Similarly, in cumulative terms, the various notions of desirable cities amount to different levels of consideration for various aspects of sustainability.TITLE Future cities: Conceptualizing the future based on a critical examination of existing notions of cities - ScienceDirectThe paper concludes by pointing out the need to ensure that the overall focus of scholars dealing with the built environment at any given time provides a balanced regard to all aspects of sustainability.TITLE Future cities: Conceptualizing the future based on a critical examination of existing notions of cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectTITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectAuckland City is New Zealand's leading city by population and contributor to national GDP.TITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectThe city's rise in prominence from 1990 is captured in various international rankings.TITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectEconomic gains have not been equally distributed within the community.TITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectAuckland has benefited from New Zealand's brand awareness over the past fifteen years.TITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectThe city faces several challenges in promoting a unified city brand identity to the world.TITLE Auckland, New Zealand's super city - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectExamine the definitions, roles, and applications of GeoICT in smart sustainable citiesTITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectIdentify frameworks and best practices for implementing smart sustainable citiesTITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectCompare Saudi Arabia's experience with identified frameworks and best practicesTITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectIdentify policy implications for Saudi Arabian smart sustainable city developmentTITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectGeoinformation and Communication Technology (GeoICT) is being increasingly adopted to foster urban sustainability and smart cities. Despite the burgeoning utilization of GeoICT, the development of frameworks of components and guidelines is still at the infancy. This is due to the fact that GeoICT implementations are guided by contextual factors and there is no one size fits all approach. This paper focuses on the topic of leveraging GeoICT for smart sustainable cities by examining the Saudi Arabian experience using information from the literature, government websites, official documents, newspaper articles and personal interviews. This study reviews the definitions, typologies, and frameworks of implementing GeoICT and smart cities. It highlights case studies of smart city development in Saudi Arabia. A comparison of the Saudi case studies with frameworks and practices found in the literature is presented. This paper concludes with policy implications for Saudi Arabia and lessons for GeoICT and smart city development. It is concluded that local context has an influence on the implementation of smart cities, ICT infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient for developing smart cities and blending top-down with bottom-up approaches is essential.TITLE Achieving smart sustainable cities with GeoICT support: The Saudi evolving smart cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Accounting for groundwater in future city visions - ScienceDirectTITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectInvestigated collectivism as predictor of city identification and city evaluation.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectSurveyed 1660 residents of Newcastle (Australia), Sydney, Paris, and Istanbul.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectCollective interdependent self-construal (CISC) predicted city evaluation.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectCity identification mediated the relation between CISC and city evaluation.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectSuggests collectivism predicts city evaluation because cities are social groups.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectCollectivism is a sociocultural variable that predicts how people relate to social groups. Cities are social groups. Hence, collectivism should predict how people relate to cities. To test this prediction, the researchers sampled 1660 residents of four cities in three countries. Participants completed an online survey containing measures of collectivism, city identification, and city evaluation. Results showed that, within each city sample and across the combined samples, a specific measure of collectivism called collective interdependent self-construal was positively related to city evaluation. Furthermore, city identification mediated the relation between collective interdependent self-construal and city evaluation. These results demonstrate that people's general tendency to construe social groups as part of their self predicts their identification with their city, which in turn helps to explain their positive appraisal of their city. These results are discussed from the perspectives of both environmental psychology and social psychology.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectTITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectThis work has shed light on trends in governance in cities.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectLocal governments obtain benefits from their network participation.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectSmart city networks empower policy making.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectSmart city networks establish a strong peer-to-peer collaboration.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectThe Spanish case can be considered a successful shared-governance network.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectThe governance of smart city networks emerges as a new research area intersecting smart governance and public networks studies. This work aims to contribute to the literature on smart cities governance by studying councillor's governance in complex networks and on network performance. To carry out this analysis, the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (RECI), one of the first of its kind and an international reference for city networks, is reviewed as a case study, with the main objective of establishing a theory on its global innovation capacity and operations, together with the local level spurring influenced on its members. A PEST (Political, Economic, Social and Technological) analysis was carried out in order to assess the impact of the smart city network both at local, national and international level. This research was completed with a consultation carried out among some of RECI's municipalities. The analysis of the results shows how RECI can be considered an example of a well organised network with quantifiable savings for its members, capable of configuring future policies in local administration, necessarily related to efficiency, digitalization and citizen-centricity and with key topics to build the future. The study also suggests recommendations oriented to potential improvements that smart city networks could undertake.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Civic entrepreneurial ecosystems: Smart city emergence in Kansas City - ScienceDirectTITLE Civic entrepreneurial ecosystems: Smart city emergence in Kansas City - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Civic entrepreneurial ecosystems: Smart city emergence in Kansas City - ScienceDirectAuthors are listed alphabetically and have contributed equallyTITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectTITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectSocio-ecological approach show Guatemala City human and environmental dimensions interrelated.TITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectGuatemala City urban history is also explained by appropriation of nature.TITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectSpatial segregation started since the foundation of the city and still continues.TITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectContemporary challenges of Guatemala City urban sustainability involves urban nature.TITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectSituated knowledge of contemporary ideas for urban sustainability are needed.TITLE Guatemala City: A socio-ecological profile - ScienceDirectThis profile of Guatemala City focuses on the intertwined human and environmental dimensions driving urban space development.

The proposed energy infrastructure utilises different technologies: wind turbine, photovoltaic panels and biogas cogeneration plants to produce electric energy, and thermal solar panels, cogeneration and heat pumps to meet the thermal energy demand of the city. The electrification of transport sector is also considered. The whole city energy system is analysed by the EnergyPLAN software to evaluate streams combination and potential synergies between the different sectors. In order to improve the analysis, PhotoVoltaic technology has been simulated in TRNSYS environment, to obtain detailed prediction of this component of the energy infrastructure. The system behaviour was analysed considering different time bases: daily, weekly and yearly. The EnergyPLAN outputs include the aggregated yearly production and demands of all modelled energy conversion systems, as well as hourly values useful to identify the measures to make Altavilla Silentina nearly zero carbon city. Every measure identified becomes a new input in EnergyPLAN to evaluate its effect on city energy balance. The economic analysis has been performed to evaluate the electricity and thermal energy costs.TITLE A renewable energy system for a nearly zero greenhouse city: Case study of a small city in southern Italy - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE City seeds: Geography and the origins of the European city system - ScienceDirectTITLE City seeds: Geography and the origins of the European city system - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Eco City Challenge and Opportunities in Transferring a City in to Green City - ScienceDirectTITLE Eco City Challenge and Opportunities in Transferring a City in to Green City - ScienceDirectTITLE Eco City Challenge and Opportunities in Transferring a City in to Green City - ScienceDirectTITLE Eco City Challenge and Opportunities in Transferring a City in to Green City - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of GU 2016.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectTITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectCulture is key for preserving the urban identity, and attracting activities and visitors.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectOnly accessible cultural monuments can perform their function for urban redevelopment.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectSpace syntax approach helps to explore spatial accessibility by remodeling of city gate.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectCity gates offer an example of multi-layered road networks and mixed-use urban ensembles.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectUrban cultural heritage should be integrated into sustainable urban redevelopment strategies.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectCulture is a key tool for promoting sustainable urban redevelopment, by preserving the urban identity, attracting activities and visitors, and fostering the quality of life. While cultural heritage sites are characterized by a large concentration of visitors, causing increased traffic flows, it is necessary to provide optimal access to cultural monuments in terms of sustainable mobility. This study focused on the city gates that have access to the cultural World Heritage Site of Gungnae City within the city of Ji'an. Space syntax approach was used in the study to explore spatial accessibility by remodeling of city gate. It is of concern that the identity characteristics of a sustainable urban form and cultural feature of the city can be recognized through the spatial configurations of urban spaces. Spatial accessibility is regarded as an integral part of the sustainable use and contemporary expression of the cultural heritage. It is noted that accessible cultural monuments can perform their function for sustainable urban redevelopment. We argued that the city gates play a crucial role in the mutual interactions among urban spaces, street networks, and human traffic, and provide people with places on gate to stay. It is of concern that the city gate remodeling in the study enables overlapping use of ancient and modernized urban zones and offers an example of multi-layered street networks and mixed-use urban ensembles in terms of urban sustainability. We concluded that urban cultural heritage should be integrated into sustainable urban redevelopment strategies to enhance the liveability of historic cities while respecting their identities.TITLE City gate as key towards sustainable urban redevelopment: A case study of ancient Gungnae City within the modern city of Ji'an - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectTITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectThe smart city utopia is an expression of the neoliberal ideology.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectCritical hermeneutics unmasks the ideological basis of the smart city utopia.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectThe smart city diverts the attention away from urgent urban problems.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectThe Genoa case shows the neoliberal roots of the smart city utopia and its shortcomings.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectThis paper develops a critical understanding of the smart city by investigating the values and ideas that underpin this concept and how they are translated into practice. It suggests that, despite private companies and municipalities promoting the smart city as a revolutionary utopia, this utopia is, on the contrary, an expression of the neoliberal ideology. The case study of the Italian city of Genoa shows that the smart city utopia acts as a generator of a collective imaginary while promoting the interests of business elites and diverting the attention away from urgent urban problems, such as urbanization. The neoliberal ideology influences the framing of these problems by favoring business-led technological solutions rather than political and long-term urban planning. The study suggests that this business-led utopia has important implications in terms of accountability of the actors involved.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectTITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectCities climate strategies in the UK support EV uptake but don't provide enough infrastructure.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectImplemented strategies are ineffectual in the EV uptake and infrastructure provision.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectBetter strategies and implementation plans are needed by national and local government.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectPolicies should be supported by local investment into public charging infrastructure.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectMany cities publish climate change mitigation strategies and other policy measures to support the wide spread uptake of Electric Vehicles (EVs). This paper investigates the effectiveness of these strategies and the provision of infrastructures in 30 UK cities, with a specific emphasis on those strategies that are within the remit of cities and local authorities. The climate mitigation strategies and supporting documents were obtained from 30 UK cities recommended by the Urban Audit Methodology. We show that 13 cities mention EVs in their strategies. Analysing EV registrations and the EV infrastructures that is provided by cities we found that there is no statistical difference in the number of charging points or EVs between the cities that have EVs as part of their climate change mitigation strategy and those that do not. It was shown that EV uptake was more generally associated with other factors (such as local vehicle population or income) rather than any documented EV/climate mitigation strategy. We demonstrate that local strategies are failing in achieving the much needed step change and make suggestions how to improve EV uptake as an even more radical thinking and policies may become necessary to achieve carbon reduction targets.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirectDr. Oliver Heidrich is a fully qualified civil engineer who works with national and international companies, local authorities and central government in environmental, life cycle assessment, stakeholder and corporate management since 1992.

However, both aspects are critical for urban energy supply designers. Therefore, this paper gives an overview of city energy simulation models from the point of view of short energy dynamics, and reviews the related modeling techniques, which generally involve detailed approaches. Analysis highlights computational costs of such simulations as key issue to overcome towards reliable microsimulation of the power demand of urban areas. Relevant physical and mathematical simplifications as well as efficient numerical and computational techniques based on uncertainties analysis and error quantification should thus be implemented.TITLE Modeling the heating and cooling energy demand of urban buildings at city scale - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Positioning Vancouver through urban sustainability strategies?

The Greenest City 2020 Action Plan - ScienceDirectCities around the world have launched greening initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint and to become more sustainable. At the same time, they have also sought to use these initiatives to position themselves as climate change leaders and green champions. This paper focuses on the City of Vancouver's Greenest City 2020 Action Plan as urban policy strategy to reduce carbon emissions. Based on interviews with actors and experts involved in the development and implementation of the plan, the paper evaluates the role green leadership aspirations play in shaping urban climate change policy and how policy makers and stakeholders use policy to position the city and its greening initiatives locally and globally. In particular, it analyzes the role of competitive positioning and green leadership in sustainability initiatives and change within and beyond urban boundaries. While leadership suggests increased buy-in of residents and those involved in the implementation of the strategy and multiplication effects through learning within the region and between (peer) cities, it can also pose challenges as the interest in meeting leadership claims can impede more radical change through specific targets and implementation strategies and challenge other sustainability objectives.TITLE Positioning Vancouver through urban sustainability strategies?

When several types of data are available for this task, the optimal type should be chosen depending on the changes that need to be detected. However, data of the desired type are not always available, particularly historical data. In this study, we propose two methods for detecting changes in a city, which can be used in complement to process available data types and detect changes in selected targets. The first method estimates the presence of buildings by comparing street-level images and a 2D city map of buildings created at different points in time. This method uses the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique to reconstruct a point cloud of the structures of the city, and matches the point cloud with the 3D building structures recovered from its 2D map. While 2D city maps are available for most cities, most are not very accurate. Therefore, this method is designed to overcome these inaccuracies and thus is widely applicable. On the other hand, the method cannot detect the following types of scene change: wall paintings, buildings that were reconstructed and closely restored to their previous shape, pedestrians, cars, and vegetation. The second method uses a pair of street-level images that are roughly aligned with GPS data collected at different points in time to detect such scene changes. This method uses the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in combination with superpixel segmentation to address inaccurate image alignment and it also enables change detection with pixel-level accuracy. Additionally, the second method is scalable for large-scale estimation because it can quickly detect scene changes by merely using an image pair without performing large-scale SfM. The authors consider the proper use of these two methods to enable temporal city modeling in various situations. We experimentally apply these methods to cities damaged by the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 and the results show their effectiveness.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Urban sustainability assessment and ranking of cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Urban sustainability assessment and ranking of cities - ScienceDirectUrban sustainability is measured on a scale [0, 1] using fuzzy logic.TITLE Urban sustainability assessment and ranking of cities - ScienceDirect46 environmental and socio-economic indicators are used and 106 cities are ranked.TITLE Urban sustainability assessment and ranking of cities - ScienceDirectA sensitivity analysis exposes the indicators with the highest potential to improve sustainability.TITLE Urban sustainability assessment and ranking of cities - ScienceDirectWith 54% of the world's population urban in 2014 it is important to assess the sustainability of cities and find systematic ways of improving it. In this paper the model SAFE (sustainability assessment by fuzzy evaluation) that was first developed to define and measure the sustainability of countries, is modified to assess the sustainability of cities worldwide. Overall sustainability is a function of two main inputs, ecological and well-being. The ecological input depends on the state of air, land and water and the well-being input on the state of the economy, education, health and civic environment of cities. SAFE uses 46 basic inputs to rank 106 cities according to sustainability. The number of inputs can be changed according to need. A sensitivity analysis identifies those basic inputs or indicators that affect sustainability the most. If such inputs are improved, the sustainability of cities improves the fastest.

These infrastructure components are often vulnerable to damage or failure due to the impact of floodwaters, thus leaving people and urban property exposed to flood hazards. To minimise the failure of hydrological infrastructure during intense flooding events, it is important to identify the most vulnerable components and to invest scarce resources in reducing their vulnerability. Using the concepts of exposure, susceptibility and resilience, this study proposes a graph-based network approach for measuring the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities. In this graph-based approach, hydrological infrastructures are represented as network nodes and the waterways as edges. The proposed vulnerability assessment approach is applied to measure and rank the vulnerability of floodgates in one of the most exemplary coastal cities - Jakarta, Indonesia. The results show that the proposed solution is both useful in highlighting the most vulnerable infrastructure components and also providing clues as to what actions can be taken to minimise infrastructure vulnerability. More so, the solution was found to be useful in identifying potential locations within the city of Jakarta, where additional infrastructure are required to improve resilience to flooding. This type of information about infrastructure vulnerability and resilience actions is vital to decision-making authorities responsible for planning, flood preparedness and priority-based allocation of resources for the maintenance of flood control infrastructure in coastal cities.TITLE Assessing the vulnerability of hydrological infrastructure to flood damage in coastal cities of developing nations - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectTITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectICT-based smart city services increase citizens overall quality of life.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectThe more usage of the ICT-based smart city services, the higher the quality of life achieved.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectCitizens' accepting and using ICT-based smart city services can be influenced by their social groups.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectICT-based smart city service should focus on service quality, innovation concepts, and the protection of users' privacy.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectThe adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) applications for the development of innovative, sustainable, and smart cities has become a new model for municipal cooperation between government and corporations. Smart cities contribute to social stability and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are taken into account during the planning and management of such services. This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens' acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city engagement. The study contributes to the academic literature and also provides practical pointers for cities and technology suppliers embarking on smart city initiatives.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The effects of successful ICT-based smart city services: From citizens' perspectives - ScienceDirectHsiaoping Yeh is an Associate Professor in the Department of Marketing & Logistics Management at National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology in Taiwan.

Drawing on a range of different interfaces and approaches, the article discusses the proliferation of urban data platforms through a set of distinct functions and typologies. The discussion aims to position urban data platforms as key sites for the development of new governance models for smart cities, and forums in which decision-makers, researchers, urbanists and technologists seek to test the potentials and pitfalls of data-driven methodologies in addressing a range of contemporary urban challenges.TITLE Smart cities and urban data platforms: Designing interfaces for smart governance - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Promoting smart cities in developing countries: Policy insights from Vietnam - ScienceDirectTITLE Promoting smart cities in developing countries: Policy insights from Vietnam - ScienceDirectSmart city development (SCD) is not only a development alternative but a crucial strategic imperative for cities in developing countries.TITLE Promoting smart cities in developing countries: Policy insights from Vietnam - ScienceDirectThere is a significant positive link between e-government development and control of corruption.TITLE Promoting smart cities in developing countries: Policy insights from Vietnam - ScienceDirectChallenges to SCD in developing countries include bias toward operational management over institutional reform, and lack of a clear strategy.TITLE Promoting smart cities in developing countries: Policy insights from Vietnam - ScienceDirectA policy framework is needed to guide and evaluate smart city initiatives in developing countries; this paper presents such a framework.TITLE Promoting smart cities in developing countries: Policy insights from Vietnam - ScienceDirectSmart city initiatives have been researched primarily in the developed country context. In developing countries, however, emerging technologies are enabling progress on urban functionality, productivity, and livability. A deeper understanding of facilitative policy conditions unique to developing countries would be useful to both theory and practice. This study presents empirically grounded insights about the policy implications of smart city development in developing countries, based on surveys of experts from the public and private sectors in 10 Vietnam cities. The study makes three contributions. First, it provides new evidence that pursuing smart city development (SCD) is not a mere alternative but a crucial strategic imperative. While facing persistent problems, Vietnam's cities exhibit significant and rapidly improving readiness for SCD. Second, the study provides new insights into related policy issues and challenges, including the positive link between e-government development and control of corruption, the risk of bias toward operational management over institutional reform, and the lack of a clear development strategy.

We propose that the effect of city reputation on city performance does not depend on this individual variable, but on specific configurations of city reputation with other city characteristics. We use a sample of 72 Spanish cities to analyze the effect of these configurations on city economic activities, employment, and migration rates. Results for fsQCA show that city reputation has complex links with performance, so that specific combinations of city reputation with other city characteristics are sufficient conditions for city performance. Moreover, the combinations differ according to the measure of performance considered. Results also show that the influence of city reputation on performance is marked by causal asymmetry. These results are of interest for local authorities, as they indicate when efforts to consolidate city reputation are relevant for city performance.TITLE The complex link of city reputation and city performance.

The theoretical structure takes as reference the recent Complexity theory for city development and their application to the networks of the Connected city. The approach is based on a justified selection of Barcelona and its four universities. We carry out a deductive and interpretivist method interviewing 19 senior experts whole profiles represent the different forces of the Triple Helix model. Our results show the Barcelona city hall has the objective to implement five main innovative services which are fuelled by six main emerging technologies. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the universities curriculum is not aligned with the city hall's objectives and a gap exists to prepare the undergraduates to the professions required for the Smart City. We recommend six propositions to reshape the University program curricula and leverage the application of Complexity theory to network. The originality of this study is to propose a 3-phases method along with a framework with pre-filled templates and protocols of interviews to analyze universities that pursue the objective to support Smart Cities implementation in a new context of science of cities.TITLE The alignment of University curricula with the building of a Smart City: A case study from Barcelona - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The alignment of University curricula with the building of a Smart City: A case study from Barcelona - ScienceDirectTITLE The alignment of University curricula with the building of a Smart City: A case study from Barcelona - ScienceDirectTITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectAn approach for processing data streams in Smart City supporting decision making.TITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectA semantic-driven architecture implementing the overall approach.TITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectStream reasoning techniques to process semantically-enriched data streams.TITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectIncremental reasoning techniques for supporting cross-domain decision making.TITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectPerformance evaluation by means of a case study related to the city of Aarhus.TITLE An approach based on semantic stream reasoning to support decision processes in smart cities - ScienceDirectThis paper discusses the use of stream reasoning models and techniques to provide a stream reasoning-based architecture to represent, manage and process data streams produced in the Smart City context, to extract useful knowledge for a better understanding of city phenomena and to support the decision making processes in both the city governance and the citizens. The proposed architecture, taking into account the need for processing heterogeneous data/information across several and different domains, is able to sustain decision-making processes deployed at operational, tactical and strategical levels. Such architecture is distributed and adopts a meet-in-the-middle configuration logic that is really effective and scalable in a complex environment like a (smart) city. The applicability of semantic technologies to implement all the aforementioned features is demonstrated by means of a complex case study realized by using a dataset, related to the city of Aarhus, provided by the CityPulse EU Project.TITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectThis study sought to uncover the link between governance in cities as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition towards a more equitable urban society.TITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectWe draw on transition management thinking to consider urban regime transitions evolving in a temporal and incremental manner and in a multi-level context.TITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectWe sought expansion from a delimited focus on socio-technical regimes in transition management literature to incorporate the notion of urban socio-economic regimes.TITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectAspects of reflexive governance and politics integrate in a city context with a basic ontology of complex social systems and their evolutionary dynamics underlying transition management approaches.TITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectThe study reveals a spatial orientation for creating new urban forms of reflexive governance as an innovation process taking place in transition arenas triggering pathways to socio-economic change.TITLE Uncovering the link between governance as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition in cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Simulation Game as a Reference to Smart City Management - ScienceDirectTITLE Using Global Trends as Catalysts for City Transition - ScienceDirectUrbanization process is triggered by population growth and technological advancement.

Much of this information has to be processed as it arrives because a real-time response is often needed. Stream processing architectures solve this kind of problems, but sometimes it is not easy to benchmark the load capacity or the efficiency of a proposed architecture. This work presents a real case project in which an infrastructure was needed for gathering information from drivers in a big city, analyzing that information and sending real-time recommendations to improve driving efficiency and safety on roads. The challenge was to support the real-time recommendation service in a city with thousands of simultaneous drivers at the lowest possible cost. In addition, in order to estimate the ability of an infrastructure to handle load, a simulator that emulates the data produced by a given amount of simultaneous drivers was also developed. Experiments with the simulator show how recent stream processing platforms like Apache Kafka could replace custom-made streaming servers in a smart city to achieve a higher scalability and faster responses, together with cost reduction.TITLE Benchmarking real-time vehicle data streaming models for a smart city - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam - ScienceDirectTITLE Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam - ScienceDirectStudy explored effects of urbanization on temperature in Cantho city, Vietnam.TITLE Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam - ScienceDirectTITLE Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam - ScienceDirectRapid urbanization yielded influence of landscape configuration on the temperature.TITLE Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam - ScienceDirectTITLE Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam - ScienceDirectTITLE Eco and Green cities as new approaches for planning and developing cities in Egypt - ScienceDirectThe Egyptian cities have faced various challenges over the time, and such challenges had negative impacts on the development efficiency and performance of these cities, producing series of dangerous problems.

London is one of the few cities in the world which has reported its GHG emission inventory using Consumption-Based (CB) methodologies. Although Madrid has adopted the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) to report their GHG emissions, the city has never officially reported its GHG inventory using CB methodologies. Thus, the goal of this study is to analyze the challenges that must be faced by the production-based GHG emission inventory of Madrid in order to estimate GHG emissions from their supply chains and final consumers using the London's GHG emissions inventory experience. From the comparison between the 2010 GHG emission inventories of Madrid and London some challenges could emerge that Madrid's decision-makers might need to face regarding urban carbon accounting practices. As results, this paper shows that if GHG emissions from urban supply chains and final consumers are considered, the total GHG emissions reported by the Madrid inventory could double. This increase is similar to what London experienced when comparing production-based and integrated production-consumption GHG inventories. Besides, some difficulties related to lack of information were found when estimating GHG emissions associated with those goods and services consumed in Madrid. It would be useful to develop a full CB inventory using environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) matrices, more city-level primary data, and local cradle-to-grave factors, following the methodology applied by the London inventory. These actions would allow a more accurate calculation of urban supply chains and final consumer GHG emissions in Madrid. Finally, further research is recommended in order to improve the current knowledge about the contributions of the energy, transport and waste sectors to GHG emissions in both, Madrid and London.TITLE Implementing city-level carbon accounting: A comparison between Madrid and London - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE An Exergy Analysis for Milano Smart City - ScienceDirectCities represent fundamental hubs in the world's energy-flow network, and their role is expected to gain further relevance in the next decades, following the ongoing urbanization process.TITLE An Exergy Analysis for Milano Smart City - ScienceDirectReducing energy use and increasing energy efficiency are crucial aspects for both existing and planned cities, and many policies have been established to pursue these objectives.

Smart city has been put forward as an effective approach to achieve better urban management recently. Smart city aims to realize the integration of municipal service, business, transportation, water, energy source and other urban sub-systems through close combination of human wisdom and information communication techniques (ICTs). As a result, the link and synergy of information could be ultimately established with ICTs, e.g., internet, internet of things, cloud computing. Yet, few studies have been conducted to systematically link smart city with big data in China. This paper aims to put forward a development framework of smart city with Chinese characteristics against the background of big data. Key actions, including rational planning of city infrastructures, the establishment and improvement of long-acting mechanism, the effective performance of city managerial function, are proposed to realize the development idea. Meanwhile, this paper also investigates the risks embedded in development of smart city with Chinese characteristics, e.g., information safety, weak emergency responding capacity and poor independent research and development capacity of core technology. This study can facilitate Chinese local governments to systematically plan smart city before clinging the hot concept in a rush.TITLE Smart city with Chinese characteristics against the background of big data: Idea, action and risk - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectIndirect household carbon footprint is evaluated based on 49 Japanese cities.TITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectCity-level carbon emissions by source were analyzed.TITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectSome household needs are significantly correlated with residents' attributes.TITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectSuggestions are made for guiding Japanese residential lifestyle alterations.TITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Exploring the indirect household carbon emissions by source: Analysis on 49 Japanese cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Are central cities poor and non-white? - ScienceDirectFor much of the 20th century, America's central cities were viewed as synonymous with economic and social hardship, and often used as proxy for low-income communities of color. Since the 1990s, however, many metropolitan areas have seen a resurgence of interest in central city neighborhoods. Theoretical models of income sorting lead to ambiguous predictions about where households of different income levels will live within metropolitan areas. In this paper, we explore intra-city spatial patterns of income and race for U.S. metropolitan areas, focusing particularly on the locations of low-income and minority neighborhoods. Results indicate that, on average, neighborhood income increases with distance to city centers for blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Income among non-Hispanic whites is uncorrelated with distance to CBD. All MSAs exhibit spatial clustering of poor and non-white neighborhoods. Economic sorting within high-minority neighborhoods is apparent for all racial groups.TITLE Are central cities poor and non-white? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectTITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectA conceptual framework for the development of an UBD is proposed.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectThe key characteristics of an UBD are discussed.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectThe integration, processing and analysis of Big Data in Smart Cities is described.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectA methodology based on archetypes is proposed to fill data gaps.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectThe development of an UBD for Lisbon is presented.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectUrban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important concern for sustainable urban planning.TITLE An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information system - ScienceDirectNational statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory.

Fuxin's economic revitalization in question - ScienceDirectFuxin is a resource-based prefecture-level city of Liaoning province in Northeast China. Despite its remote location, short urban history and sparse population, the city was positioned as a nationwide role model of socialist economy by the central state in the Maoist era. However, the city economy quickly turned into decline in the wake of market reforms and resource depletion. Since 2001 the central state has been striving to revitalize Fuxin's economy, through pumping massive investment for developing new industry. Many claim that given the rapid rise of several new industries Fuxin has successfully regained its role model position for rust belt cities to revitalize, but this taken-for-granted conclusion is questionable. This City Profile challenges the prevailing role-model idea of Fuxin's revitalization, with a particular focus on the emerging negative impacts engendered by the top-down policy interventions. We critically analyze why national policies failed to help the city transform, and argue that Fuxin's economy has suffered from critical problems.TITLE Building a role model for rust belt cities?

In this context, real-time data streams are continuously produced and analysed by efficient and effective algorithms, which are able to handle complexities related to big data, in order to enable the core functions of Decision Support Systems in the smart city. These algorithms should receive input data coming from different city domains (or pillars) and process, aggregate and reason over them in a way that it is possible to find hidden correlations among different and heterogeneous elements (e.g., traffic, weather, cultural events) along space and time dimensions. This paper proposes the online implementation and deployment of Temporal Fuzzy Concept Analysis on a distributed real-time computation system, based on Apache Storm, to face with big data stream analysis in the smart city context. Such online distributed algorithm is able to incrementally generate the timed fuzzy lattice that organizes the knowledge on several and cross-domain aspects of the city. Temporal patterns, of how situations evolve in the city, can be elicited by both exploring the lattice and observing its growth in order to obtain actionable knowledge to support smart city decision-making processes.TITLE Distributed online Temporal Fuzzy Concept Analysis for stream processing in smart cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Distributed online Temporal Fuzzy Concept Analysis for stream processing in smart cities - ScienceDirectCarmen De Maio graduated and received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Sciences, both from the University of Salerno, Italy, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

Cities usually source a major part of their natural resource demand from their local, national and global hinterland, and cause emissions across the whole global supply chain of a city's final demand. It is important that the data underlying carbon footprint assessments of cities capture these supply chains adequately and comprehensively. In this research, we determine the carbon footprints of four Chinese cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin based on different levels of data availability. Using these case studies, we show conclusively that city carbon footprint analyses must include input-output databases and associated calculus in order to avoid severe errors that arise from unacceptable scope limitations caused by the truncation of the footprint assessment boundary. We also show that city input-output databases must fulfil a number of requirements for city comparisons and for informed decision-making to be feasible. Our findings suggest that investment into multi-layered national input-output tables and datasets will be necessary to monitor progress of cities reducing their greenhouse emissions across the whole supply chain and to inform evidence based policy making that guides greenhouse abatement.TITLE Assessing carbon footprints of cities under limited information - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectTITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectUrban Scaling Values are not universal, they significantly and non-trivially depend on the way one constructs cities from census areal data.TITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectThe socioeconomic Diversity within cities responds differently to size effects between cities.TITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectThere are groups of urban attributes (infrastructure, daily services, etc.) which share similar distributions within cities and between cities.TITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectThe scaling behaviour of these groups varies similarly with city definition.TITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectScaling laws are powerful summaries of the variations of urban attributes with city size. However, the validity of their universal meaning for cities is hampered by the observation that different scaling regimes can be encountered for the same territory, time and attribute, depending on the criteria used to delineate cities. The aim of this paper is to present new insights concerning this variation, coupled with a sensitivity analysis of urban scaling in France, for several socio-economic and infrastructural attributes from data collected exhaustively at the local level. The sensitivity analysis considers different aggregations of local units for which data are given by the Population Census. We produce a large variety of definitions of cities (approximatively 5000) by aggregating local Census units corresponding to the systematic combination of three definitional criteria: density, commuting flows and population cutoffs. We then measure the magnitude of scaling estimations and their sensitivity to city definitions for several urban indicators, showing for example that simple population cutoffs impact dramatically on the results obtained for a given system and attribute. Variations are interpreted with respect to the meaning of the attributes (socio-economic descriptors as well as infrastructure) and the urban definitions used (understood as the combination of the three criteria). Because of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and of the heterogeneous morphologies and social landscapes in the cities' internal space, scaling estimations are subject to large variations, distorting many of the conclusions on which generative models are based. We conclude that examining scaling variations might be an opportunity to understand better the inner composition of cities with regard to their size, i.e. to link the scales of the city-system with the system of cities.TITLE Diverse cities or the systematic paradox of Urban Scaling Laws - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (160KB)Download full-size imageTITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectTITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectShifting to compact, transit-oriented urban form could have economic benefits and reduce GHG emissions.TITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectAttractive, well-functioning urban infrastructure and services are key enablers for the GHG and economic benefits of a compact urban form.TITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectCity-scale emission reductions will not always yield global-scale emission reductions.TITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectMeasures to reduce urban air pollution can also reduce global GHG emissions.TITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectTo maximize contributions to global GHG emission reductions will need to address emissions associated with consumption of goods and services.TITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectCity governments are increasingly taking an active role in economic development. Urban leaders around the world have different resources, strengths and priorities, but cities focus on creating an attractive environment to live, work and grow businesses, and they often invest in enhanced infrastructure and improved public services. As economic hubs, cities also have a crucial role to play in mitigating global climate change. Cities at all levels are pursuing climate action, and many of the measures they are choosing have also been shown to have broader economic and social benefits. This paper looks at this issue in the other direction, examining the potential GHG impact of policies and actions that are already widely used by cities to advance economic development and competitiveness. We find that there are several instances where local economic development practices can also reduce global GHG emissions, including compact development, mass transit and non-motorized infrastructure, expansion of renewable electricity access, and improvements to waste and water utility infrastructure, under certain conditions. In contrast, a continuation of car-centric, sprawling development could fail to realize the economic efficiency of compact forms and tend to lock in a higher trajectory for carbon emissions, rendering future mitigation more challenging and costly.TITLE How does local economic development in cities affect global GHG emissions? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The life cycle of cities - ScienceDirectWhile an ever-growing percentage of the world's population is urban, the rate at which cities grow is not uniform. The lifetime of individual cities includes periods of fast growth, slow growth and periods of shrinkage. There exists an extensive literature concerned with possible means to manage specific pathologies. It is our view that the design of specific policies should be the result of a comprehensive model of urban health. While not all cities go through the entire life cycle, a comprehensive theory of cities and specific policies need to include specification of the interaction of the various forces that shape the entire range of urban patterns and identification of specific combinations of values that create phase transitions among these patterns.TITLE The life cycle of cities - ScienceDirectTo sort these ideas we suggest that there is a need to consider and incorporate the structure and timing of innovation activities, agglomeration effects that they generate, interurban migration patterns and assorted feedback mechanisms. We hypothesize that these flows depend on the activity rhythms of the various processes and their differential impact on cities. We present a biology inspired rudimentary framework as a basis for the construction of an ABM of cities with a focus on the nature of time and as a basis for analyzing urban dynamics.1TITLE The life cycle of cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The life cycle of cities - ScienceDirectCzamanski would like to thank The Israel Science Foundation for partial funding of the research on which this paper is based.TITLE Financing the Disaster Resilient City in the Slovak Republic - ScienceDirectThis paper presents a framework for scaling climate change adaptation in cities in the Slovak Republic.

It is widely claimed that in growing cities, individuals' transport energy use could be made more efficient by planning to control urban sprawl and create polycentric urban structures. However, existing conclusions are mixed. This paper contributes to this issue with an in-depth analysis of China's cities. Interestingly, polycentric cities demonstrated lower travel energy efficiency than monocentric ones. This is mainly because urban sub-center developments have failed to combine employment and residential land use. In these planned sub-centers, land use is usually dominated by either housing or industrial park developments, requiring people to commute long distances between home and work, and use cars at high rates. Increasing fragmentation of development management due to political decentralization has apparently worsened the job-housing imbalance. Though a significant effect of urban structure on transport energy consumption was observed, car use control policies had no effect, while a high level of metro services was associated with lower energy consumption.TITLE The influence of urban structure on individual transport energy consumption in China's growing cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Applying City Marketing as a Tool to Support Sustainable Development in Small Cities: Case Study in Ukraine - ScienceDirectTITLE Applying City Marketing as a Tool to Support Sustainable Development in Small Cities: Case Study in Ukraine - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of Green Cities 2016.TITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectTITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectThe urban increment is one component of the impact of a city to its air pollution.TITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectThe urban increment equals the city impact when two assumptions are fulfilled.TITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectSHERPA is used to assess the validity of the incremental approach in EU cities.TITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectThe incremental approach generally underestimates the urban impact for PM2.5.TITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectThe incremental approach is not a good proxy to estimate the urban impact.TITLE On the validity of the incremental approach to estimate the impact of cities on air quality - ScienceDirectThe question of how much cities are the sources of their own air pollution is not only theoretical as it is critical to the design of effective strategies for urban air quality planning. In this work, we assess the validity of the commonly used incremental approach to estimate the likely impact of cities on their air pollution. With the incremental approach, the city impact (i.e. the concentration change generated by the city emissions) is estimated as the concentration difference between a rural background and an urban background location, also known as the urban increment. We show that the city impact is in reality made up of the urban increment and two additional components and consequently two assumptions need to be fulfilled for the urban increment to be representative of the urban impact. The first assumption is that the rural background location is not influenced by emissions from within the city whereas the second requires that background concentration levels, obtained with zero city emissions, are equal at both locations. Because the urban impact is not measurable, the SHERPA modelling approach, based on a full air quality modelling system, is used in this work to assess the validity of these assumptions for some European cities. Results indicate that for PM2.5, these two assumptions are far from being fulfilled for many large or medium city sizes. For this type of cities, urban increments are largely underestimating city impacts. Although results are in better agreement for NO2, similar issues are met. In many situations the incremental approach is therefore not an adequate estimate of the urban impact on air pollution. This poses issues in terms of interpretation when these increments are used to define strategic options in terms of air quality planning. We finally illustrate the interest of comparing modelled and measured increments to improve our confidence in the model results.TITLE Shrinking cities: An unfit term for American urban policy? - ScienceDirectTITLE Shrinking cities: An unfit term for American urban policy? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Urban agriculture in Mexico City; balancing between ecological, economic, social and symbolic value - ScienceDirectTITLE Urban agriculture in Mexico City; balancing between ecological, economic, social and symbolic value - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) - ScienceDirectTITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) - ScienceDirectWe show that city brands are affected by urban policies and grassroots dynamics at the same time.TITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) - ScienceDirectWe discuss the impact of the current refugee crisis on the city brand Munich.TITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) - ScienceDirectHereby it is shown how the city brand is co-constructed by its residents.TITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) - ScienceDirectAlso the threat of a city brands' co-destruction by its residents is discussed.TITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) - ScienceDirectUp till now, only few researchers have looked at the dynamics that develop when citizens' collective actions co-create and eventually co-destruct a city brand. This research paper analyzes the interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand development during the refugee crisis that had its peak in autumn 2015 in Germany. We chose the city of Munich (Germany) as the case, because the city has managed to communicate itself as an open and tolerant place. However currently, this city has increasingly been jeopardized by the refugee crisis and thus constitutes an extreme case illustrating city brand co-creation and potential co-destruction dynamics. Based on our qualitative research, we derive three propositions about city brand co-creation and co-destruction which aim to stimulate future research. In doing so, this research is a highly relevant example for cities in crisis, where collective action is supporting as well as challenging the co-created meaning of a place (brand).TITLE The interplay between urban policies and grassroots city brand co-creation and co-destruction during the refugee crisis: Insights from the city brand Munich (Germany) -

Although there are studies that propose frameworks for building resilient cities, these studies do not provide detailed guidelines that include the sequential steps that local governments need to take to involve the different stakeholders in the city resilience building process. Given this gap, this paper presents a maturity model that provides an ideal sequence of maturity stages that can guide local government in how to involve the different city stakeholders in the city resilience building process. In addition, the maturity model provides a number of policies that local governments need to implement at each maturity stage in order to foster four principles (collaboration and networking, awareness and commitment, learning, and training and preparedness) that represent the foundation for involving stakeholders in the resilience building process. The maturity model was developed and validated as result of an iterative process that included semi-structured interviews with representatives from six different European cities.TITLE A maturity model for the involvement of stakeholders in the city resilience building process - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE A maturity model for the involvement of stakeholders in the city resilience building process - ScienceDirectRaquel Gimenez is a Phd Student in the Management Department of TECNUN, the Engineering School of the University of Navarra (Spain).

Yet, the majority of literature on this topic is concerned about the Developed Western and East Asian World. With the aim to contribute to the existing studies and to fill this gap in the literature, this paper makes an attempt to study an example in the fast-developing Arab States in the Middle East, which has recently drawn a particular attention among the scholars. Dubai provides an interesting case study, as it currently hosts the major transhipment hubport of the region. Centred on a single case-study approach, a four-phase model is hypothesized as a tool to investigate the changing spatial and functional dynamics at the port-city interface from the 1900s to the 2010s. The argument is based on a reciprocal relationship between the port and the city, since the advent of a free port. Historically the port has been the economic backbone. Consequently the Creek dredging and newly constructed ports integrated with ancillary infrastructures (such as FTZs) have played an important role in boosting the growth. Some concluding remarks underline the main trends in Dubai's port-city development, compared to the existing European and Asian models. This dynamic evolution is influenced by internal factors, such as oil revenues and governmental strategies, as well as external ones, like the regional and global forces. Despite sharing common features with the Asian consolidation model, this study suggests that Dubai may demonstrate a particular pattern of port-city development.TITLE Development dynamics of port-cities interface in the Arab Middle Eastern world - The case of Dubai global hub port-city - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The Smart City Concept in the 21st Century - ScienceDirectTITLE The Smart City Concept in the 21st Century - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of INTER-ENG 2016.TITLE Towards Eco-city: The Role of Green Innovation - ScienceDirectGreen innovation is fundamental for the transition of city towards eco-city.

An empirical investigation of Smart Cities' governmental websites - ScienceDirectIn view of the increased popularity of eGovernment as an important aspect of the development of Smart or Informational World Cities, we outline three research questions: (1) What is the state of maturity of eGovernments in Informational World Cities? (2) How good (or poor) is their usability? (3) How do they handle boundary documents? In order to clear up these issues empirically, we formulated an extended criteria model for the quantification of eGovernment maturity, analyzed the average quality of the information architecture of 31 identified Informational World Cities' official websites, and studied the processing of boundary documents, i.e. documents that serve different user groups. Our outcomes indicate that the maturity and usability levels of investigated cities are much differentiated, whereas the implementation of boundary documents in form of detailed information sheets is rather scarce. Considering the maturity of investigated eGovernments, there is still potential for improvement, especially regarding the aspects of communication and transaction services. The differences between the eGovernments' usability standards are substantial and the results are partially suboptimal. Our outcomes indicate that the usability levels retrieved from task-based evaluation are not directly linked to integration of boundary documents into the governmental websites.TITLE eGovernment in cities of the knowledge society.

For this research, the present status regarding the deterioration of the Nanjing City Wall was first surveyed, after which we attempted to identify the factors causing the deterioration. Herein, a simulation model expressing the infiltration of rainwater into the city wall is proposed, and based on the simulation results, the influence of rainwater on the deterioration of the wall is examined. The simulation results showed that the rainwater increases the moisture content of the inside bricks and plaster only very slowly.TITLE The City Intelligence Quotient (City IQ) Evaluation System: Conception and Evaluation - ScienceDirectAfter a systematic review of 38 current intelligent city evaluation systems (ICESs) from around the world, this research analyzes the secondary and tertiary indicators of these 38 ICESs from the perspectives of scale structuring, approaches and indicator selection, and determines their common base. From this base, the fundamentals of the City Intelligence Quotient (City IQ) Evaluation System are developed and five dimensions are selected after a clustering analysis. The basic version, City IQ Evaluation System 1.0, involves 275 experts from 14 high-end research institutions, which include the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Science and Engineering (Germany), the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences, the Planning Management Center of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China, and the Development Research Center of the State Council of China. City IQ Evaluation System 2.0 is further developed, with improvements in its universality, openness, and dynamic adjustment capability. After employing deviation evaluation methods in the IQ assessment, City IQ Evaluation System 3.0 was conceived. The research team has conducted a repeated assessment of 41 intelligent cities around the world using City IQ Evaluation System 3.0. The results have proved that the City IQ Evaluation System, developed on the basis of intelligent life, features more rational indicators selected from data sources that can offer better universality, openness, and dynamics, and is more sensitive and precise.TITLE The City Intelligence Quotient (City IQ) Evaluation System: Conception and Evaluation - ScienceDirectAvailable online 30 June 2016TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectTITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectTests the impact of the broader context on changes in city crime levels.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectCities experiencing increasing population in the decade experience crime decrease.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectGreater population in surrounding area results in larger crime increases in cities.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectIncreasing inequality and racial heterogeneity in surrounding areas results in crime increases.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectRelationships for inequality and heterogeneity have strengthened from 1970 to 2010.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectThis study explores whether the broader context in which a city is located impacts the change in crime levels over the subsequent decade. This study uses a wide range of cities (those with a population of at least 10,000), over a long period of time (from 1970 to 2010). We test and find that although cities with larger population and those surrounded by a county with a larger population typically experience larger increases in crime over the subsequent decade, cities experiencing an increase in population during the current decade experience crime decreases. The study finds that cities with higher average income experience greater subsequent crime decreases, and those surrounded by counties with larger unemployment increases experience crime increases. Higher levels of income inequality and racial/ethnic heterogeneity are associated with increasing crime rates, and increasing inequality and racial/ethnic heterogeneity in the surrounding county are associated with further increases. Furthermore, this relationship has strengthened since 1970, suggesting that both scales of inequality are even more important from a public safety perspective. Finally, we tested the time invariance of these relationships, and showed that the magnitude of the relationship between city-level inequality and increasing crime has increased over the study period.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Cities and the larger context: What explains changing levels of crime? - ScienceDirectJohn R.

To take this nexus between city age and city size into account, we introduce endogenous city creation into a dynamic economic model of an urban system. Our model predicts a pattern of age-dependent urban growth that is in line with recently established empirical evidence. The size distribution that emerges in our economy delivers a close fit to different types of US data and it outperforms other suggested parametrizations.

The literature on urban low-carbon transition shows that low-carbon urban development is an inevitable trend of urban sustainable future; there is a great potential albeit with some limitations for cities to reduce its carbon footprints, and there are diverse pathways for cities to achieve low-carbon development. There is, however, a limited understanding in terms of the internal mechanism of urban low-carbon transition, especially in rapidly developing economies. This paper attempts to address this gap. We examine how low-carbon policies emerge and evolve, and what are the enabling mechanisms, taking Shanghai as a case study. We developed an analytical framework drawing on system innovation theory and sustainability experiments for this purpose. A total of 186 relevant policies were selected and analyzed, which is supplemented by the interviews with stakeholders in the government to gain a deeper insight into the policy contexts in Shanghai. We found that the city's low-carbon initiatives are embedded and integrated into its existing policy frameworks. A strong vertical linkage between the central and the local governments, and more importantly, a nested structure for innovative policy practices were identified, where a top-down design is met with bottom-up innovation and proactive adoption of enabling mechanism. The structure includes two layers of experiments that facilitate learning through policy experiments across scales. The uniqueness, effectiveness, applicability and limitations of these efforts are discussed. The findings provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the multilevel governance of low-carbon transition in cities.TITLE Experimenting towards a low-carbon city: Policy evolution and nested structure of innovation - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectWe employed a difference-in-differences model with two-way fixed-effects panel regression.TITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectThe launch of BSSs has mixed effects on congestion in general.TITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectBy introducing BSSs, larger cities get better off while richer cities get worse off.TITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectBSSs can reduce peak-hour congestion.TITLE Bike-sharing systems and congestion: Evidence from US cities - ScienceDirectIn the past decades, there has been a resurgence of public bike-sharing systems (BSSs). While it is claimed that social and environmental benefits are associated with the implementation of BSSs, few empirical studies have investigated the actual congestion reduction effect of BSSs on cities. To fill such gap, this paper aims to examine whether the launch of BSSs can reduce citywide congestion. With a panel dataset of 96 urban areas in the US from 2005 to 2014, we employed a difference-in-differences model with two-way fixed-effects panel regression. The results suggested that the introduction of BSSs shows a significant mixed impact on congestion in general: Larger cities get better off but richer cities get worse off. Such results are consistent with both subsample regression with propensity score matching and different congestion measures. Post-hoc analysis reveals that BSSs have a significant positive effect on reducing rush-hour congestion.

However, a great proportion of vacancy in these newly developed units leads to the undesired observation of ghost cities. Lacking of clear and effectively evaluation criterion, the understanding of ghost cities in China is then rather limited. Considering the fact of ghost cities, we borrow the theory of urban vitality to identify and evaluate ghost cities in this paper. We argue that ghost cities are associated with very low urban vitality. In the light of big/open data, we are able to profile ghost cities of China based on 535,523 recent project-level residential developments from 2002 to 2013. We use the national-wide and million magnitude road junctions, points of interest and location based service records of 2014/2015 for measuring the morphological, functional and social vitality of each residential project. We then aggregate the project level evaluation results into the city level and thirty ghost cities are then identified by comparing the residential projects' vitality in the old (developed before or in 2000) and new (developed after 2000) urban areas in each city. Our profiling results illustrate the big picture of China's past residential developments, and then of ghost cities. We find the average vitality of residential projects in new urban areas is only 8.8% of that in old urban areas, denoting the potential existence of ghost cities in newly developed areas in Chinese cities. We have also benchmarked our identified ghost cities with existing rankings, the Baidu searching engine and night-time light images. Although we admit that ghost cities may exist in the particular urbanizing phase of China and that some ghost cities now may be well developed in the future, this study provides a thorough evaluation on the ghost city condition in China. This may shed light on policy implications for Chinese urban development.TITLE Evaluating cities' vitality and identifying ghost cities in China with emerging geographical data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Sorting through Neoliberal Variations of Ghost Cities in China - ScienceDirectTITLE Sorting through Neoliberal Variations of Ghost Cities in China - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectUrbanization modifies light intensities and surface temperatures.TITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectLight intensities increase with urban area.TITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectTemperature tendencies indicate decrease at daytime (increasing at nighttime).TITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectHigh light intensity regions show less seasonal variability in temperature tendency.TITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (299KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectThe paper studies the social effects of the eco-innovative interventions in the context of Italian smart cities.TITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectEmpirical evidence does not always show that the benefits are distributed in an uniform manner.TITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectFifty-one projects are analyzed.TITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectRegarding environmental and mobility projects, very often the beneficial effects of projects are directed to all social groups, without exclusions.TITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectWith energy projects, we have to be careful about their effective economic and technological accessibility.TITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities - ScienceDirectThis paper reports results from research conducted on smart environmental projects implemented in Italy and posted on the national web platform italiansmartcity.it.

In this study, we used Twitter data to analyse city dynamics over the course of the day. Users of this social network were grouped according to city zone and time slot in order to analyse the daily dynamics of the city and the relationship between this and land use. First, daytime activity in each zone was compared with activity at night in order to determine which zones showed increased activity in each of the time slots. Then, typical Twitter activity profiles were obtained based on the predominant land use in each zone, indicating how land uses linked to activities were activated during the day, but at different rates depending on the type of land use. Lastly, a multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of the different land uses on each of the major time slots (morning, afternoon, evening and night) through their changing coefficients. Activity tended to decrease throughout the day for most land uses (e.g. offices, education, health and transport), but remained constant in parks and increased in retail and residential zones. Our results show that social network data can be used to improve our understanding of the link between land use and urban dynamics.TITLE City dynamics through Twitter: Relationships between land use and spatiotemporal demographics - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectEnergy savings are achieved when users change their behavior.TITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectCities should involve all public and private players in a collaborative and transparent setting.TITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectCities should develop the technical capacity to procure and monitor information services.TITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectCities should focus on basic infrastructure, including road network and traffic management.TITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities - ScienceDirectFor cities in developing countries with lower motorization, less-developed infrastructure, less financial resources, and less institutional and technical capacity, our recommendations to achieve benefits from smart mobility investments are: (1) involve all public and private players in a collaborative and transparent setting;

Previous research has mainly considered FDI spillover effects within a closed area. Few studies have investigated how the technological upgrading of one area is influenced by the FDI in nearby regions. This paper therefore explores how the time-based characteristics of FDI, namely the pace and rhythm of FDI expansion, influence technological upgrading within and across cities. Using the panel data of 244 Chinese cities for the period from 2004 to 2011, our empirical results show that FDI spillovers have a positive effect on local technological upgrading in both local and neighbouring cities. Irregular FDI expansion negatively moderates FDI spillovers in the same city, but exhibits a positive effect on technological upgrading in neighbouring regions. Moreover, only rapid FDI expansion in neighbouring cities has a positive effect on local technological upgrading and can enhance its technological spillover effects across cities. Our empirical evidence provides implications for both the theoretical framework and policy making.TITLE FDI pace, rhythm and host region technological upgrading: Intra- and interregional evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Potential and relevance of urban mining in the context of sustainable cities - ScienceDirectThe objective of urban mining is the safeguarding of the environment and the promotion of resource conservation through reuse, recycling, and recovery of secondary resources from waste.

The cities analyzed are Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Manila (the Philippines). Squatter activity in each one is analyzed from the Post-WW II period of the 1950's and 1960's, to the contemporary situation of 2015. Each of these cases can be characterized at the beginning of the period, as having large numbers of squatters and squatter settlements, with few or no adequate housing, municipal services, etc. Each one of them dominated by economic elites in the form of conglomerates. The analysis describes the initial conditions of squatters, major shifts and events during the last fifty or so years, and the different outcomes in the struggles for place in the cities. The analysis is based upon observations, interviews and institutional materials gathered by the author in the 1960's, 1970,s and 1980's and from interviews, reports and institutional data currently available on each case. The analysis in these six case studies show that a unified political elite, little or no squatter mobilization and government control or ownership of the land, were the most important institutional factors in integrating squatters into cities. Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur integrated all or most squatters into the formal housing of their cities.TITLE Winning their place in the city: Squatters in Southeast Asian cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Winning their place in the city: Squatters in Southeast Asian cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectWe explore the effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions.TITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectWith STIRPAT model, we estimate spatial spillover effect by spatial econometrics.TITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectWe match firm-level data and panel data of 283 cities from 2003 to 2010 in China.TITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectWe investigate heterogeneous spatial effects from subdivision industry.TITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectBoth specialization and diversification can promote carbon emission reduction.TITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectThis study expounded the mechanism of the effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions based on the theory of agglomeration economies. Based on the STIRPAT model, we built an econometric model. We then used the method of spatial econometrics to estimate the effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions through matching the firm-level data and panel data of 283 prefecture level and above cities from 2003 to 2010 in China. The results reveal that both specialization and diversification agglomeration can significantly promote carbon emission reduction in local and neighboring cities through the agglomeration externalities. Specifically, specialization agglomeration of low-end technology industry has significant reduction effects on carbon emission of local and neighboring cities in most cases, while the diversification agglomeration has increased it. The specialization and diversification agglomeration of midrange technology industry have increased the carbon emissions of the local and neighboring cities. Furthermore, the specialization and diversification agglomeration of high-end technology industry have significant carbon emission reduction effects in varying degrees for the local and neighboring cities.TITLE The effects of urban agglomeration economies on carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Personalized cooling as an energy efficiency technology for city energy footprint reduction - ScienceDirectThis study analyses the influence of Personalized Conditioning (PC) systems for potential savings of energy, cost, and CO2 emissions from commercial buildings in different U.S. cities. This analysis characterizes potential benefits from the deployment of PC systems during peak cooling hours for peak load shifting. PC systems deployed in coordination with the central building air conditioning systems could have a large-scale influence on a city's energy footprint. Specifically, portable PC systems that use Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for heat rejection, allow for heat absorption during the working hours and heat rejection during non-working hours typically coinciding with the off-peak (base) utility rates when the commercial building tend to be unoccupied. However, there are limiting factors for the potential energy and cost savings with the use of PC systems. Therefore, this study assesses the use of PC systems in addition to the existing building air conditioning system during cooling seasons. The assessment entails potential energy end-use savings for 7 major cities located in different geographical/climatic regions of the U.S. Furthermore, the study calculates potential cost savings based on the variations in the peak and off-peak (base) electricity rates for different local Time of Use (TOU) programs. This simulated evaluation of local building systems and utility programs allows for regional various on the city's energy footprint reduction to emerge. The analysis shows that midrise apartments are a better building type than office buildings for the deployment of PC systems during a cooling season. The cash savings per person for the deployment of PC systems for midrise apartments are $62/year, $40/year, and $37/year for Honolulu, NY City, and Phoenix, respectively. The simulations also showed that using extended setpoint temperatures could reduce the CO2 emissions up to 21.4% per year.TITLE Personalized cooling as an energy efficiency technology for city energy footprint reduction - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Syntactical analysis of the accessibility and sociability of a square in the Kuala Lumpur City Center - ScienceDirectThe lack of visibility and the difficulty in developing a cognitive map may be particularly important in wayfinding and in categories where the use of accessibility and sociability will provide a square suggestion in the Kuala Lumpur City Center Park (KLCC). This study attempted to examine the existing structure within the vicinity of KLCC and the transformations of its vicinity based on a square suggestion through morphological analysis using axial analysis and observations. The axial analysis shows how the accessibility of the square has shifted within the city and compares it with an existing park. Moreover, a square suggestion can provide context for the Petronas Twin Towers as a landmark and symbolic building. A square, as a regular geometry, can aid in improving the configuration of the vicinity of KLCC. Consequently, this research is useful to architects, tourism managers, and urban designers because it demonstrates the importance of effective factors in sustaining accessible and sociable space, such as a square.TITLE Syntactical analysis of the accessibility and sociability of a square in the Kuala Lumpur City Center - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Southeast University.TITLE A hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach for supporting sustainable water resources planning in Zhengzhou City, China - ScienceDirectTITLE A hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach for supporting sustainable water resources planning in Zhengzhou City, China - ScienceDirectDevelop one system dynamics method of water supply-demand system of Zhenghou City.TITLE A hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach for supporting sustainable water resources planning in Zhengzhou City, China - ScienceDirectA hybrid system dynamics and ptimization approach for water resources planning.TITLE A hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach for supporting sustainable water resources planning in Zhengzhou City, China - ScienceDirectDevelop an interval-parameter two-stage stochastic programming.TITLE A hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach for supporting sustainable water resources planning in Zhengzhou City, China - ScienceDirectTITLE Scaling up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling: Lisbon case study - ScienceDirectTITLE Scaling up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling: Lisbon case study - ScienceDirectA methodology to scale up LEED-ND sustainability assessment towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling.TITLE Scaling up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling: Lisbon case study - ScienceDirectThe methodology is tested using the Lisbon case study.TITLE Scaling up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling: Lisbon case study - ScienceDirectIdentification of the priority intervention areas, parameters, and strategies for sustainable urban planning.TITLE Scaling up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling: Lisbon case study - ScienceDirectCities and governments are increasingly interested in refurbishing the existing built environment as a key component in plans to reduce GHG emissions and resource efficiency strategies. In this sense, the building industry started to develop sustainability assessment tools, first to guide new or major renovation building projects, and slowly progressing toward the evaluation of neighborhoods and cities. However, scaling up sustainability is a challenge due to the increased number of parameters and stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. This paper presents a methodology to scale up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling. This approach was tested for the current Lisbon case study. It resulted in the identification of the priority intervention areas and parameters. The paper further highlights four policy recommendations: reduce water flood risk; increase mixed residential and non-residential developments; reinforce the adoption of energy certifications, and create similar schemes for water consumption. These findings can support decision-makers to develop urban redevelopment strategies and improve the overall city sustainability performance.TITLE Scaling up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling: Lisbon case study - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectTITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectMoves debate beyond seeing artists in a simple dichotomy of either opponents of or enthusiastic supporters of creative city policy.TITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectTITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectTITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectExamines a different urban context (Stockholm) to explore the locally-contingent nature of the negotiation of the creative city.TITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectSuggests shifting focus away from focusing on artists as opposing creative city policy.TITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectTITLE Artists and creative city policy: Resistance, the mundane and engagement in Stockholm, Sweden - ScienceDirectTITLE Smart Green Open Space Outlook: Pattern Identification (Case Study: Yogyakarta City and Batu City) - ScienceDirectTITLE Smart Green Open Space Outlook: Pattern Identification (Case Study: Yogyakarta City and Batu City) - ScienceDirectPeer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of CITIES 2015.TITLE Enabling Energy Smart Cities through Urban Sharing Ecosystems - ScienceDirectIn order to build real smart cities, heterogeneous data from different sources has to be properly collected, integrated and shared.

Using a unique data set gathered through a survey of mid-sized U.S. cities in 2015, this article examines patterns in food scrap management at the municipal level. Specifically, it studies the extent to which there are shared characteristics among those places most likely to develop municipal capacity for food scrap diversion, and how these patterns can inform policy makers eager to migrate to more sustainable materials management at the local level. We utilize a logistic regression model to test the relationships between two types of food scrap diversion capacities and both socio-economic and municipal waste system characteristics. We find that socio-economic characteristics have limited correlation with the presence of food scrap programming in general in mid-sized cities. Cities with yard waste collection and unit-pricing, on the other hand, are more likely to also have any food scrap diversion programs. We find further that, in mid-sized cities, population density is positively correlated with the curbside collection of food scraps, as is the presence of unit-pricing, while cities that have retained source-separated curbside recycling programs are less likely to have curbside food scrap collection.TITLE Patterns in municipal food scrap programming in mid-sized U.S. cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Grouping cities based of their socio-economic indicators - ScienceDirectIn this paper a new approach in analyzing city behaviour and its dynamic developments is proposed. Usual attributes are divided into two larger groups: social and economic. This idea makes possible analyzing relative performances of cities from different angles, such as: two-dimensional clustering; city ranking by simple calculating their distance from origin; minimum sum of squares clustering, etc. Such an analysis is helpful to show good and week points in developing city strategy in long term period. Grouping of 77 capital cities of regions in Russia is considered. The averages of both groups, for each city are calculated, covering 12 years. Minimum sum-of-squares criterion is used for clustering and solved by variable neighborhood search. It appeared that there are a few outlier cities, two of them being non dominated or efficient.

There is a general assumption that neighborhood is the fundamental category of analysis to study attachment and identity. However, except for a few studies focusing on environments such as dwellings, other spatial scales still need to be explored. This gap exists despite the fact that the intensity of attachment and identity bonds established with place are supposedly affected by the size of the environment. In order to explore differences in the relation between the two bonds and the size of the environment, we carried out a study in neighborhoods and cities. We further investigated possible differences in place attachment and place identity between residents who were born in the city and residents originally from other cities. The sample involved 208 participants (54.8% natives and 45.2% from other cities). Results showed a higher level of attachment and identity to city than to neighborhood. Place attachment was higher in large and small-sized cities than in medium-sized. Place identity, on the other hand, was greater in large rather than in small and medium-sized cities. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the two bonds and the length of residence in the city. However, having been born in the city or not did not affect the intensity of bonds with place.

Optimization of urban freight transport (UFT) can make an important contribution to the sustainability and livability of cities, conducing in the alleviation of traffic congestion and the mitigation of CO2 emissions and noise impacts. The detailed understanding of the causal effect of UFT measures on achieving sustainability of city logistics is the main scope of this paper. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is adopted to assess selected UFT measures by advancing the research in life cycle analysis (LCA) to city logistics processes. Focusing on administrative/regulatory schemes, strongly related to city typology, a scenario is evaluated and two indices are estimated, one addressing the city (demand logistics sustainability index), and the second referring to logistics stakeholders (supply logistics sustainability index). The difference between the two indices, referred to as logistics gap, is also estimated.TITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectModern cities score well regarding water management in international city rankings.TITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectThey are however dependent on external water resources for the food they consume.TITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectMediterranean urban citizens eat too many animal products and sugar.TITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectThey can save a lot of water by shifting to a healthy diet.TITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Water consumption related to different diets in Mediterranean cities - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (395KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Methodology for assessing cycling comfort during a smart city development - ScienceDirectSmart city development that encourages more bicycles on the road will pave way for a city with an energy-efficient transport. In this direction, the current work involves developing a cycling comfort matrix based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations of an urban layout (Niigata city in Japan) under different meteorological conditions (wind directions) enables us to measure cycling comfort through: (a) the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) a thermal comfort measure and (b) the Turbulence Intensity (TI). Work involves validation of CFD wind prediction with measured experimental data. Results show that during the summer time, the higher wind velocity regions will provide thermal comfort to cyclist (near-zero PMV regions), but such zones also tend to have higher TI (due to high gradients near the buildings at high wind speed) which may be unsafe. This work has the prospect of both aiding in planning of new cycle routes and developing smart urban building layouts.TITLE Toward Resilient and Sustainable City Adaptation Model for Flood Disaster Prone City: Case Study of Jakarta Capital Region - ScienceDirectFlood disaster is one of the problems that could threaten the sustainability of Jakarta. The intensity of major floods continues to increase as a result of high rainfall and land conversion as well as poor urban drainage system. Therefore, the city requires an increased capacity to face flood disaster. The enhancement of the city capacity needs to be well designed to achieve a state of city that is resistant to disaster or what is known as a Resilient City. The purpose of this research is to develop an adaptation model of flood disaster prone city resilience to actualize the sustainability of the city of Jakarta. Based on the position analysis results using Structural Equations Model (SEM), 4 (four) factors affecting the adaptation model of resilience disaster prone city of Jakarta were found, which are spatial arrangement, technology innovation, disaster mitigation, and disaster adaptation. To form a resilient city, resilient ways are required.

The promotion of nature-based solutions represents an efficient approach to meet sustainability targets in cities and improve the quality of life of citizens. The association of large components of green infrastructure, such as urban parks, with physical activity can counteract the sedentary lifestyle endemic to cities and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals (Carrus et al., 2013; Scopelliti et al., 2016). By promoting a sustainable means of transport and connecting green spaces within a highly urbanized city, bicycle lanes represent an effective tool for associating physical activity with nature in cities allowing bicycle users to benefit from the positive health effects of nature-based solutions. Our study focuses on the potential of bicycle lanes to improve functional connectivity among green spaces. We administered 820 questionnaires in 34 green spaces (i.e., urban parks) in Bucharest, Romania, to identify the factors influencing the use of bicycle lanes connecting urban parks and to understand which planning criteria for bicycle lanes are considered as the most important by park visitors. We applied binary and ordinal logistic regressions and found that the factors affecting bicycle lane use are illegally parked cars and lack of accessibility to urban parks. The criteria preferred by park visitors for bicycle lane planning are determined by experience level and frequency of bicycle use. To develop a functional and integrated bicycle lane network that can make cities healthier and more sustainable, policy makers are advised to engage in a public participatory process and focus on the needs of bicycle users.TITLE Towards an index of city readiness for cycling - ScienceDirectTITLE Towards an index of city readiness for cycling - ScienceDirectPeer review under responsibility of Tongji University and Tongji University Press.TITLE 3cixty: Building comprehensive knowledge bases for city exploration - ScienceDirectTITLE 3cixty: Building comprehensive knowledge bases for city exploration - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectTITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectLack of elevation data hinders the construction of 3D city models.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectWe infer heights of buildings solely from 2D footprints and attributes.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectLOD1 models are generated by extruding footprints to the predicted height.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectWe achieve sub-meter accuracy in the predicted heights.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectThe resulting 3D models satisfy the CityGML standard quality recommendations and those of several spatial analyses.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectElevation datasets (e.g. point clouds) are an essential but often unavailable ingredient for the construction of 3D city models. We investigate in this paper to what extent can 3D city models be generated solely from 2D data without elevation measurements. We show that it is possible to predict the height of buildings from 2D data (their footprints and attributes available in volunteered geoinformation and cadastre), and then extrude their footprints to obtain 3D models suitable for a multitude of applications. The predictions have been carried out with machine learning techniques (random forests) using 10 different attributes and their combinations, which mirror different scenarios of completeness of real-world data. Some of the scenarios resulted in surprisingly good performance (given the circumstances): we have achieved a mean absolute error of 0.8m in the inferred heights, which satisfies the accuracy recommendations of CityGML for LOD1 models and the needs of several GIS analyses. We show that our method can be used in practice to generate 3D city models where there are no elevation data, and to supplement existing datasets with 3D models of newly constructed buildings to facilitate rapid update and maintenance of data.TITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectDownload high-res image (618KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Generating 3D city models without elevation data - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectTITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectWe propose two ttechnological efficiency indices for the use and capability in ICT.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectWe analyse the influence of two factors related with the use and capability in ICT on the different dimension of a Smart City.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectThe results allow us to corroborate that these factors clearly influence economic development.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectThe most important factor is the capability factor with a clear influence over human and image capital, and the use factor on environmental capital.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectIn the information society, ICT (Information and Communications Technology) use and capability are regarded as keys to economic growth. Use of these ICTs depends on the access and ability of citizens, while capability primarily depends on government investment in Research and Development (R&D) and the degree of development of technology-related sectors.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectUsing information society and science and technology statistics for NUTS 2 statistical regions from the Eurostat database, we construct two synthetic indices for cities based on ICT use and capability, and these are used to group the cities into clusters. We then study the relationship between the ICT indices and economic development, taking wealth and intellectual capital as a measurement of knowledge-based European cities. The results show that both factors, use and capability, are significant but particularly so regarding investment in R&D and the development of ICT sectors.TITLE The effect of ICT use and capability on knowledge-based cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Content synchronization using device-to-device communication in smart cities - ScienceDirectWith the acceleration of high data demand from mobile users and urbanization, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication networks have emerged as a new paradigm to alleviate the traffic load on the cellular networks. Due to high mobility of devices, establishing and ensuring the success of D2D transmission in an intermittently connected network is a major challenge. In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of synchronizing the content of a subset of nodes in D2D networks. We adopt the City Section mobility model to mimic node movement in a city area, and produce theoretical analysis to the properties of the model. Based on this model, we propose two content synchronization strategies called direct contact synchronization and relay-assisted synchronization. We provide theoretical analysis to the performance of the two strategies, which derives the theoretical upper bound of their synchronization delay. We further conduct simulations to compare the proposed algorithms, which confirms the theoretical conclusion that relay-assisted synchronization substantially outperforms direct contact synchronization in terms of success rate and delay with a slight increase in the cost.TITLE Content synchronization using device-to-device communication in smart cities - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Content synchronization using device-to-device communication in smart cities - ScienceDirectTITLE Content synchronization using device-to-device communication in smart cities - ScienceDirectXiao Chen is an Associate Professor of computer science with Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA.

This scenario is particularly troublesome in developing countries where secondary cities are growing at an unprecedented rate but lack the institutional capacity to manage urbanization. Secondary cities are tier II cities below primary cities in the urban hierarchy. To examine the unique challenges and opportunities facing secondary cities, we trace Pune's urban growth. Pune is the second largest city in the state of Maharashtra, India and is emerging as an industrial and educational hub. The presence of large industrial and educational sectors has resulted in massive urban population growth, including a large migrant population from rural areas. This massive growth is straining Pune's critical infrastructures. First, we trace Pune's urban history in terms of social, economic, administrative, and environmental planning and development. Second, we examine key urban challenges faced by the city. We find that while the city of Pune is moving towards becoming a megacity, it still has a chance to change its trajectory to become one that is more sustainable, equitable, and just. However, to evolve into a sustainable and equitable city, Pune's urban planners need to pay careful attention to several urbanization issues. This profile offers insights regarding the unique challenges faced by secondary cities in developing countries and discusses policy implications to transform secondary cities into catalysts for economic growth and development.TITLE City profile: Pune, India - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectTITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectThematic quantification of over 50,000 topics, 800,000 posts and 800 groups.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectApplication of quantitative measures in a 16-dimensional construct.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectSynthesizing analysis through ranking scores and distributing on 16 dimensions.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectIdentifying encounters and culture and leisure dimensions as most salient.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectEncounters and culture & leisure captured 11.88 and 11.11 % of the ranking points.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectResearch has documented that social media facilitated word-of-mouth has become the most influential city brand communication channel. This online ethnography of the the Shanghai city brand experience applies a predetermined, 16-dimensional construct as the heuristic strategy for data gathering and analysis. It identifies the person-to-person encounters dimension as the most salient. Dimensions such as environmentalism, which in other studies has been identified as significant for the Shanghai city brand, appears to occupy a relatively low priority in the online discourse relating to Shanghai. These insights can be can be leveraged for the purpose of formulating a realistic brand positioning strategy for Shanghai, centered around the items constituting the encounters dimension. Further this study identifies that while the city branding associated with the World Expo in 2010 appears to be disconnected from the salience of the encounters dimensions, the Shanghai city branding campaign launched in 2015 is more congruent with the findings of this study as it draws on the historical uniqueness of Shanghai as being a space for inter-cultural encounters between East and West.TITLE The 'mental topography' of the Shanghai city brand: A netnographic approach to formulating city brand positioning strategies - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE An algorithm for sink positioning in bus-assisted smart city sensing - ScienceDirect

Such data is usually sent to sinks, using the paradigm of Internet of Things. However, covering the whole city area with static sensors might be expensive. This paper addresses the utilization of the public transportation system as a mobility platform for sensor nodes and bus stops acting as sinks. This platform can improve the coverage of a sensor network and take advantage of opportunistic communication. Since this platform can be used for delay-constrained applications, we propose an algorithm to choose sensor sinks in the bus stops of a smart city that minimizes the maximum delay when delivering messages. We compare our solution with an optimal formulation and use real data, obtained in buses from Rio de Janeiro, as an input of our algorithm. Our experiments show that we can use approximately 16% of bus stops as sinks, having less than 10% of increase in the network maximum delay and no significant loss in the spatial coverage.TITLE An algorithm for sink positioning in bus-assisted smart city sensing - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE An algorithm for sink positioning in bus-assisted smart city sensing - ScienceDirectPedro Cruz is pursuing his Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at UFRJ.
