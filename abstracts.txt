This work aims to contribute to the literature on smart cities governance by studying councillor's governance in complex networks and on network performance. To carry out this analysis, the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (RECI), one of the first of its kind and an international reference for city networks, is reviewed as a case study, with the main objective of establishing a theory on its global innovation capacity and operations, together with the local level spurring influenced on its members. A PEST (Political, Economic, Social and Technological) analysis was carried out in order to assess the impact of the smart city network both at local, national and international level. This research was completed with a consultation carried out among some of RECI's municipalities. The analysis of the results shows how RECI can be considered an example of a well organised network with quantifiable savings for its members, capable of configuring future policies in local administration, necessarily related to efficiency, digitalization and citizen-centricity and with key topics to build the future. The study also suggests recommendations oriented to potential improvements that smart city networks could undertake.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title This work has shed light on trends in governance in cities.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title Local governments obtain benefits from their network participation.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title Smart city networks empower policy making.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title Smart city networks establish a strong peer-to-peer collaboration.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title The Spanish case can be considered a successful shared-governance network.TITLE Smart city networks' governance: The Spanish smart city network case study - ScienceDirect title The governance of smart city networks emerges as a new research area intersecting smart governance and public networks studies.

Cities are social groups. Hence, collectivism should predict how people relate to cities. To test this prediction, the researchers sampled 1660 residents of four cities in three countries. Participants completed an online survey containing measures of collectivism, city identification, and city evaluation. Results showed that, within each city sample and across the combined samples, a specific measure of collectivism called collective interdependent self-construal was positively related to city evaluation. Furthermore, city identification mediated the relation between collective interdependent self-construal and city evaluation. These results demonstrate that people's general tendency to construe social groups as part of their self predicts their identification with their city, which in turn helps to explain their positive appraisal of their city. These results are discussed from the perspectives of both environmental psychology and social psychology.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title Investigated collectivism as predictor of city identification and city evaluation.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title Surveyed 1660 residents of Newcastle (Australia), Sydney, Paris, and Istanbul.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title Collective interdependent self-construal (CISC) predicted city evaluation.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title City identification mediated the relation between CISC and city evaluation.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title Suggests collectivism predicts city evaluation because cities are social groups.TITLE Individual differences in collectivism predict city identification and city evaluation in Australian, French, and Turkish cities - ScienceDirect title Collectivism is a sociocultural variable that predicts how people relate to social groups.

The proposed energy infrastructure utilises different technologies: wind turbine, photovoltaic panels and biogas cogeneration plants to produce electric energy, and thermal solar panels, cogeneration and heat pumps to meet the thermal energy demand of the city. The electrification of transport sector is also considered. The whole city energy system is analysed by the EnergyPLAN software to evaluate streams combination and potential synergies between the different sectors. In order to improve the analysis, PhotoVoltaic technology has been simulated in TRNSYS environment, to obtain detailed prediction of this component of the energy infrastructure. The system behaviour was analysed considering different time bases: daily, weekly and yearly. The EnergyPLAN outputs include the aggregated yearly production and demands of all modelled energy conversion systems, as well as hourly values useful to identify the measures to make Altavilla Silentina nearly zero carbon city. Every measure identified becomes a new input in EnergyPLAN to evaluate its effect on city energy balance. The economic analysis has been performed to evaluate the electricity and thermal energy costs.TITLE A renewable energy system for a nearly zero greenhouse city: Case study of a small city in southern Italy - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE A renewable energy system for a nearly zero greenhouse city: Case study of a small city in southern Italy - ScienceDirect title This paper presents an economic and energy feasibility analysis of a renewable energy system for a small city in southern Italy to convert it to zero greenhouse gas city by 2030.

While cultural heritage sites are characterized by a large concentration of visitors, causing increased traffic flows, it is necessary to provide optimal access to cultural monuments in terms of sustainable mobility. This study focused on the city gates that have access to the cultural World Heritage Site of Gungnae City within the city of Ji'an. Space syntax approach was used in the study to explore spatial accessibility by remodeling of city gate. It is of concern that the identity characteristics of a sustainable urban form and cultural feature of the city can be recognized through the spatial configurations of urban spaces. Spatial accessibility is regarded as an integral part of the sustainable use and contemporary expression of the cultural heritage. It is noted that accessible cultural monuments can perform their function for sustainable urban redevelopment. We argued that the city gates play a crucial role in the mutual interactions among urban spaces, street networks, and human traffic, and provide people with places on gate to stay. It is of concern that the city gate remodeling in the study enables overlapping use of ancient and modernized urban zones and offers an example of multi-layered street networks and mixed-use urban ensembles in terms of urban sustainability.

It suggests that, despite private companies and municipalities promoting the smart city as a revolutionary utopia, this utopia is, on the contrary, an expression of the neoliberal ideology. The case study of the Italian city of Genoa shows that the smart city utopia acts as a generator of a collective imaginary while promoting the interests of business elites and diverting the attention away from urgent urban problems, such as urbanization. The neoliberal ideology influences the framing of these problems by favoring business-led technological solutions rather than political and long-term urban planning. The study suggests that this business-led utopia has important implications in terms of accountability of the actors involved.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title The smart city utopia is an expression of the neoliberal ideology.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title Critical hermeneutics unmasks the ideological basis of the smart city utopia.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title The smart city diverts the attention away from urgent urban problems.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title The Genoa case shows the neoliberal roots of the smart city utopia and its shortcomings.TITLE Smart cities: Utopia or neoliberal ideology? - ScienceDirect title This paper develops a critical understanding of the smart city by investigating the values and ideas that underpin this concept and how they are translated into practice.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of these strategies and the provision of infrastructures in 30 UK cities, with a specific emphasis on those strategies that are within the remit of cities and local authorities. The climate mitigation strategies and supporting documents were obtained from 30 UK cities recommended by the Urban Audit Methodology. We show that 13 cities mention EVs in their strategies. Analysing EV registrations and the EV infrastructures that is provided by cities we found that there is no statistical difference in the number of charging points or EVs between the cities that have EVs as part of their climate change mitigation strategy and those that do not. It was shown that EV uptake was more generally associated with other factors (such as local vehicle population or income) rather than any documented EV/climate mitigation strategy. We demonstrate that local strategies are failing in achieving the much needed step change and make suggestions how to improve EV uptake as an even more radical thinking and policies may become necessary to achieve carbon reduction targets.TITLE How do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make? - ScienceDirect title Dr. Oliver Heidrich is a fully qualified civil engineer who works with national and international companies, local authorities and central government in environmental, life cycle assessment, stakeholder and corporate management since 1992.

ScienceDirect title Consensus-oriented urban planning is related to a compensatory land-use regime.TITLE Contested urban green spaces in the compact city: The (re-)negotiation of urban gardening in Swiss cities - ScienceDirect title Since the intensification of the search for sustainable urban planning, the ideal of the compact and green city characterized by high density, mixed land use and attractive green infrastructure, has become a desirable urban form at global scale. Urban greening, including urban gardening, has experienced a resurgence of interest. Within the frame of the compact city, the meanings, forms and functions of urban gardening have been re-evaluated for their contribution to urban sustainability, turning those spaces into a contested subject of negotiation. This qualitative study, conducted in the Swiss cities of Basle, Berne, Geneva and Zurich, investigates how the meanings of urban gardening are discursively (re)produced in political negotiation processes and how different rationalities of space produce a hegemonic order, constructing urban gardening sites as contested spaces. The findings demonstrate that urban growth strategies within the frame of the compact city, aiming at an efficient and resource-saving (re)organization of urban space, are discursively rationalizing current transformation processes. While so-called traditional forms of urban gardening are closed down, displaced to locations with less significance for urban development plans, or transformed in spatial and functional terms, new forms of urban gardening commensurate with the current ideals of urban landscapes and are emerging in the inner-city areas.TITLE Contested urban green spaces in the compact city: The (re-)negotiation of urban gardening in Swiss cities - ScienceDirect title Simone Tappert is a PhD candidate at the Institute for European Ethnology at the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich (PhD program Transformations in European Societies).

In this paper we propose several ideas on how to define the concept of Smart City, including our own. However, our main focus will be on the question of the safety and security in such cities in the future. Our study of the Smart City program shows the lack of importance which is being given to this topic. Because of that, we are inspired to introduce our definition of a Safe City. Along with the topics of safety and security, we also provide the reader with an insight into the importance and use of the modelling and simulations in a Safe City.TITLE Smart City, Safety and Security - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of TRANSCOM 2017: International scientific conference on sustainable, modern and safe transport.TITLE Competitiveness of Global Cities from the Perspective of the Global Power City Index - ScienceDirect title TITLE Competitiveness of Global Cities from the Perspective of the Global Power City Index - ScienceDirect title The GPCI evaluates its target cities in six urban functions: Economy, Research and Development, Cultural Interaction, Liveability, Environment, and Accessibility. Each of the functions comprises multiple indicator groups, which in turn consist of several indicators, with a total of 70 indicators being used in the GPCI. The average indicator scores of the indicator groups are combined to create the function-specific rankings. The comprehensive ranking is then created by totalling the scores of the function-specific rankings.TITLE Competitiveness of Global Cities from the Perspective of the Global Power City Index - ScienceDirect title London, New York, Paris and Tokyo retain their hold on the top four places, respectively. Since hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, London in particular has been steadily increasing its score, further widening its lead on #2 New York. In Asia, a widening gap is prominent between mid- and top-rank cities. Singapore (#5) and Hong Kong (#7) make significant gains, while Shanghai (#17) and Beijing (#18) slip in the rankings after exhibiting promising vitality in previous years. There is a surge by North American cities as Los Angeles jumps from #20 to #14, San Francisco from #32 to #21 and Boston from #30 to #23. This is due to the broader economic recovery pushing up their scores in Economy and Liveability.TITLE Competitiveness of Global Cities from the Perspective of the Global Power City Index - ScienceDirect title The research results of the GPCI could potentially serve as valuable data to improve our understanding of the challenges faced by cities around the world as well as assist in the formulation of urban policies and corporate strategies.TITLE Competitiveness of Global Cities from the Perspective of the Global Power City Index - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of the Urban Transitions Conference.TITLE Urban growth in Indian cities: Are the driving forces really changing? - ScienceDirect title Urbanization in India is happening at a rapid pace since past three decades.

In most cases, however, planning policies based on theses factors fail to consider that travel patterns are not uniform in each metropolitan area. Furthermore, the travel pattern of inter- and intra-municipality that results from spatial interaction between a central city and its various sub-centres and suburbs in a metropolitan area has not been fully explored. A consideration of the specific urban system could therefore provide an answer to the question of why certain factors have different effects on the transit modal split and car travel distance between municipalities of a metropolitan area. The aim of this study was therefore to find an effective way to establish compact-city planning policies in municipalities of the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). An investigation of the changed travel pattern in each municipality based on the changed relationship between transit modal split (TMS) and intra-city trip ratio by car (ITR) between 2006 and 2010 found that the SMA became more car-dependent: TMS and ITR of the municipalities declined together, and ITR decreased much more in the outskirts. Based on the relationship between the two factors, the effects of changes in land use and transportation were estimated using a combination of cluster and regression analysis. This revealed that, in municipalities of Seoul and its adjacent sub-centres, there is a need to promote transit-oriented development (TOD) by creating high-density areas within close proximity to city railroad stations. In contrast, it is necessary, in municipalities on the outskirts of the SMA, to restrict large-scale developments, such as large retail centres, and instead promote a mixture of self-sufficient land uses. In the intermediate municipalities that lie between these two, TMS and ITR can be increased through TOD near railroad stations, or ITR alone can be increased through a greater mix of land use. These findings could assist in implementing effective compact-city planning policies in each municipality of the SMA, and could also be applied to the other metropolitan areas in Korea or elsewhere in the world.TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title Municipalities of a metropolitan area influence each other in travel patterns.TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title The closer a municipality is to the central city, the higher its transit modal split (TMS).TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title Municipalities further from the centre have a higher intra-city trip ratio by car (ITR).TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title TMS and ITR decline together but differently depending on each city conditions.TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title Considering the difference can enhance the effect of compact-city planning policy.TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title Compact-city planning factors are commonly applicable even to metropolitan areas.

These findings could assist in implementing effective compact-city planning policies in each municipality of the SMA, and could also be applied to the other metropolitan areas in Korea or elsewhere in the world.TITLE Relationship between transit modal split and intra-city trip ratio by car for compact city planning of municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Area - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title The factors that influence city-level CO2 emissions in China were investigated.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title A spatial agglomeration effect was identified in city-level CO2 emissions.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title Per capita GDP, population, industrialization level, capital investment, and population density increase CO2 emissions.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title Road density and the traffic coupling factor both decrease CO2 emissions.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title The factors that influence city-level CO2 emissions in China were investigated.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title A spatial agglomeration effect was identified in city-level CO2 emissions.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title Per capita GDP, population, industrialization level, capital investment, and population density increase CO2 emissions.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title Road density and the traffic coupling factor both decrease CO2 emissions.TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO2 emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE What are the differences between sustainable and smart cities?

It is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities from the outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. For this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. Although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. Those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. These methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. Furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. For example, the average values of CO2 emissions per capita and PM10 concentration in cities with more than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. When analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. It is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policy making. Otherwise, ineffective and inefficient policies will be developed.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title Download high-res image (237KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title No definition of a city is commonly shared in some different academic fields.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title We propose a method to delineate boundaries of cities based on population density.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title Practical methods based on the density, night-time light and landcover are compared.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title Difference in urban indicators is due to difference in method of specifying a city.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title Relevant definitions of cities should be chosen for policy making based on its aim.TITLE Methods for specifying spatial boundaries of cities in the world: The impacts of delineation methods on city sustainability indices - ScienceDirect title The purpose of this paper is to analyze how different definitions and methods for delineating the spatial boundaries of cities have an impact on the values of city sustainability indicators.

However, the traditionally strong relationship between ports and port cities has gradually weakened due to the emerging negative externalities of ports. Therefore, port-city municipalities need to better understand the relationship between port activities, urban competitiveness, and the attraction of investment. This paper uses the Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) and related regression models to test this relationship as well as identify the determinants of urban competitiveness. The results show that despite the positive relationship between port and urban networks, port cities currently exhibit no significant advantages over non-port cities in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI); in addition, port-city competitiveness depends more on urban characteristics than on port factors. Based on these results, we propose various strategies for port-city developments.TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title The cohesion between port activities, urban competitiveness, and the attraction of FDI is explored.TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title A positive correlation between maritime and urban FDI networks is identified.TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title The weaknesses of port cities in attracting investment, compared with non-port cities, are investigated.TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title The implication of better integrating into the global trade and urban networks of port cities is presented.TITLE Building a bridge between port and city: Improving the urban competitiveness of port cities - ScienceDirect title Historically, ports have been an important location factor for cities, enabling international trade and investment and facilitating urbanization processes.

However, despite the growing body of research on city-regions, the evolution of this phenomenon and its implications for contemporary spatial governance remains a huge gap in urban planning literature, while approaches to their delineation have largely been restricted to commuting patterns data and approximations. This research examines the emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance using Ghana as an illustrative case. In the process, inspired by Tobler's first law of geography and the concept of distance decay, the study engages a unique methodological approach that uses spatial mapping of rural-urban population continuum, transportation network, built-up patterns and GIS techniques for the delineation of city-region. The research finds a gap between the rapidly emerging spatial structure of Accra and the operational governance framework, as there is no provision in the latter for the planning and management of the evolving city-region which, territorially, spans multiple administrative regions. At the local context, while making the lagging spatial governance system more responsive to the dynamically evolving spatial structure, it is imperative that urban policy recognises city-regions, such as the Accra City Region (ACR), and their diverse opportunities; plan for them through joint development planning boards; and foster natural coordination even among local planning authorities across different administrative regions. At the global scale, the research practically illustrates that alternative methodologies based on spatial mapping and GIS techniques could provide useful insights into the study of city-regions.TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Examines the emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance.TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title There is a gap between the rapidly evolving spatial structure of the city-region and the existing spatial governance framework.TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title The spatial structure and governance framework mismatch hampers effective urban planning and management.TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Alternative methodologies based on spatial mapping of rural-urban population continuum, built-up patterns, transport network and GIS techniques offer useful insights into the study of city-regions.TITLE The emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance: Evidence from Ghana - ScienceDirect title Over the years, urbanization has triggered complex spatial processes, such as the evolution of city-regions that defy traditional administrative regional boundaries. However, despite the growing body of research on city-regions, the evolution of this phenomenon and its implications for contemporary spatial governance remains a huge gap in urban planning literature, while approaches to their delineation have largely been restricted to commuting patterns data and approximations. This research examines the emergence of city-regions and their implications for contemporary spatial governance using Ghana as an illustrative case. In the process, inspired by Tobler's first law of geography and the concept of distance decay, the study engages a unique methodological approach that uses spatial mapping of rural-urban population continuum, transportation network, built-up patterns and GIS techniques for the delineation of city-region. The research finds a gap between the rapidly emerging spatial structure of Accra and the operational governance framework, as there is no provision in the latter for the planning and management of the evolving city-region which, territorially, spans multiple administrative regions.

The creation of ubiquitous cities (u-city), with intelligent convergence systems, is a solution to overcoming these problems. The u-city is at a more advanced level than a smart city, and building a smart city is a step toward the u-city. Thus, this study develops an effective framework to determine the required platform toward establishing a u-city by explores the main components of a smart city, such as citizens, environments, and key infrastructures, and the criteria to measure each component. The interaction between the components and their criteria, are specified using the Analytical Network Process (ANP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods Finally, according to the weights obtained, a ubiquitous coefficient for a city is proposed. In this study, the u-coefficients for Tehran, Iran and Seoul, South Korea are obtained (45% and 92%, respectively), which verify the accuracy of the suggested framework for determining ubiquitous conditions of cities. Tehran has the highest weights in the basic components (citizens and governments) and it needs to invest in building a ubiquitous infrastructure in transportation, healthcare, and the economy.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title Canopy layer urban heat island (UHI) evaluation using local climate zone (LCZ).TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title Need for data filtration before UHI analysis is emphasised.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title Mapping LCZ subclasses is important in heterogeneous built type city.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title The procedure helps in identifying critical LCZ for intervention.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title Canopy layer urban heat island (UHI) evaluation using local climate zone (LCZ).TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title Need for data filtration before UHI analysis is emphasised.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title Mapping LCZ subclasses is important in heterogeneous built type city.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title The procedure helps in identifying critical LCZ for intervention.TITLE Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city - ScienceDirect title TITLE The impact of the European Union integration on the city size distribution of the Member States - ScienceDirect title TITLE The impact of the European Union integration on the city size distribution of the Member States - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The impact of the European Union integration on the city size distribution of the Member States - ScienceDirect title TITLE The impact of the European Union integration on the city size distribution of the Member States - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Embodied water intensities and actual demands of China's mega-cities are analyzed.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Embodied water transfers of China's mega-cities are assessed.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Most of the mega-cities are net recipients of embodied water.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title The water utilization efficiencies of mega-cities are relatively high.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Transfer imbalance regarding pressure and efficiency is identified.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Water resources are of fundamental significance as the basis of human life, economy, and society. Especially as the essential socioeconomic factors, water resources transferred through merchandise trade of China's mega-cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing) play an increasingly crucial role in China's regional water use allocation. On the whole, the four municipalities in China are all embodied water recipients along supply chains. However, it is found that embodied water transfers (including direct and indirect water) related to these mega-cities have exacerbated the regional water use imbalance and affected the water use efficiency of China as a whole to some extent. In consideration of the increasing trading exchanges among cities and regions, ignoring water transfers embodied in trades will lead to failure in depicting actual water demands. In such a context, the embodied water demands and transfers of China's municipalities are analyzed systematically, and the water use efficiencies and allocation imbalance are assessed for the first time. Outcomes of this study through systems accounting of water use profiles of China's mega-cities can be strong supports for reasonable allocation and utilization of China's water resources, showing important implications for water pressure mitigation.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Embodied water transfers of China's mega-cities.Download high-res image (240KB)Download full-size imageTITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Embodied water intensities and actual demands of China's mega-cities are analyzed.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Embodied water transfers of China's mega-cities are assessed.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Most of the mega-cities are net recipients of embodied water.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title The water utilization efficiencies of mega-cities are relatively high.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Transfer imbalance regarding pressure and efficiency is identified.TITLE Embodied water demands, transfers and imbalance of China's mega-cities - ScienceDirect title Water resources are of fundamental significance as the basis of human life, economy, and society.

The understanding of different infrastructures resilience and vulnerabilities is important for the city security. In this work we focus on the notion of transportation infrastructure vulnerability. Some infrastructure types or some specific infrastructure elements can be more or less vulnerable than the others. Following mentioned facts the paper focuses on assessment of the city infrastructure vulnerability to the effects of disasters as a part of the resilient city concept. The proposed assessment is intended to be applied to the critical infrastructure.TITLE Vulnerability of the City Infrastructure as a Part of the Resilient City Concept - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of TRANSCOM 2017: International scientific conference on sustainable, modern and safe transport.TITLE An edge-based platform for dynamic Smart City applications - ScienceDirect title

PSS encapsulate data-driven modelling approaches for envisioning alternative future cities scenarios. They are widely available but have limited adoption in the planning profession (Russo, Lanzilotti, Costabile, & Pettit, 2017). Research has identified issues preventing their mainstream adoption to be, among others, the gap between PSS supply and demand (Geertman, 2016), their difficulty of use, a need for greater understanding of PSS capabilities and a lack of awareness of their applications (Russo et al., 2017; Vonk, Geertman, & Schot, 2005). To address this, a review of five PSS is conducted in the context of four vignettes applied in Australia and applicable internationally. A critical review has been undertaken, demonstrating how these PSS provide an evidence basis to understand, model and manage growing cities. The results suggest that PSS can assist in undertaking key tasks associated with the planning process. In addition to supporting planning and decision making, PSS can potentially enable better co-ordination between city, state and federal planning and infrastructure agencies, thus promoting a multi-scaled approach that improves local and national data sharing, modelling, reporting and scenario planning. The research demonstrates that PSS can assist in navigating the complexities of rapid multi-faceted urban growth to achieve better-informed planning outcomes. The paper concludes by outlining ways PSS address limitations of the past and can begin to address anticipated future challenges.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title Big data and rapid analytics provide the fuel for data-driven planning of cities.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title Planning support systems (PSS) are a growing part of the smart city movement.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title PSS can be applied at various scales for a range of urban challenges.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title PSS address the variety, visualisation and value of big data.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title Upskilling the next generation of planners will assist in PSS adoption.TITLE Planning support systems for smart cities - ScienceDirect title In an era of smart cities, planning support systems (PSS) offer the potential to harness the power of urban big data and support land-use and transport planning.

High-speed rail cities bypassed by high-speed trains - ScienceDirect title Since high-speed rail (HSR) is designed primarily to connect large cities, it challenges how smaller cities en-route are still going to be serviced by rail. Scholars have focused mainly on cities bypassed by HSR that have experienced a decrease in conventional rail services or on how several smaller cities have nevertheless been able to secure appropriate facilities to be served by high-speed trains in the context of compromises between HSR travel time and political pressures. Indeed, local and regional authorities often do their best to secure specific rail infrastructures to accommodate HSR services. However, in their euphoria they usually forget to consider HSR operations. Yet it is the services supplied (routes, frequencies and timetables) that ultimately determine the utility of HSR for those smaller cities, and the real possibility of being connected to other cities. In this context, this paper complements the existing literature by revisiting the case for smaller en-route HSR cities through a service-oriented perspective. We examine four European case studies and find that cities that initially succeed in securing HSR infrastructure may still be bypassed to some extent. Reasons include intermodal competition based on travel time, insufficient potential markets for train companies seeking higher revenues and rail stations not being designed appropriately.TITLE Mind the services!

There are two main purposes of the paper - a theoretical one and empirical one. The author's concept of maturity levels of cities in planning and implementing activities in favor of urban freight transport is the theoretical objective, while the empirical objective deals with the analysis of selected European capital cities in terms of urban policy in creating long-term plans in the area of urban freight. In order to achieve these objectives the author has conducted a survey among selected European cities. As a result of the conducted survey, the description of the process maturity levels of studied cities with the use of a taxonomic measure in the field of planning and implementing urban freight transport actions has been proposed. The concept of process maturity of cities in the field of planning and carrying out actions in urban freight transport may be a practical tool for local authorities willing to self-improve and develop in this field.TITLE Urban freight transport in city strategic planning - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Urban freight transport in city strategic planning - ScienceDirect title The issue of urban freight transport in city strategic planning is discussed in this paper.

Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators, exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs.TITLE Analysis and assessment of a knowledge based smart city architecture providing service APIs - ScienceDirect title Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a more sustainable mobility and transport systems. Sii-Mobility is grounded on Km4City ontology and tools for smart city data aggregation, analytics support and service production exploiting smart city API. To this end, Sii-Mobility/Km4City APIs have been compared to the state of the art solutions. Moreover, the proposed architecture has been assessed in terms of performance, computational and network costs in terms of measures that can be easily performed on private cloud on premise. The computational costs and workloads of the data ingestion and data analytics processes have been assessed to identify suitable measures to estimate needed resources. Finally, the API consumption related data in the recent period are presented.TITLE Analysis and assessment of a knowledge based smart city architecture providing service APIs - ScienceDirect title Claudio Badii graduated in Computer Engineering at the University of Florence.

This definition should have given a new twist in recent years, as society and, in particular, cities have entered or intend to do so in the idea of Smart City, which implies the adaptation and preparation of the population and education that will take place towards this situation. With this idea, we started an investigation to examine whether, the cities that erect the seal of Smart City, take actions to integrate the entire population and improve social inclusion. After analysing documents from the centre and the implementation of Intercultural Education in different schools, through observation and interviews to teachers, at different stages and cities, defined as Smart City, we got that, no school undertakes any action respect the integration and social inclusion of the population in their classrooms. Leading us to conclude that the label of Smart city is adding new social disadvantages, leading us to, among our recommendations, that the concept of Intercultural Education should be renewed, including the idea of Intelligent Citizens for Smart Cities.TITLE Smart City and Intercultural Education - ScienceDirect title Peer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of EDUHEM 2016.TITLE Economic solutions to improve cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets - ScienceDirect title TITLE Economic solutions to improve cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets - ScienceDirect title Economic alternatives to improve e-government and smart city cybersecurityTITLE Economic solutions to improve cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets - ScienceDirect title Incentive mechanisms to make smart products securerTITLE Economic solutions to improve cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets - ScienceDirect title Life cycle model of vulnerabilities and game theoretical analysisTITLE Economic solutions to improve cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets - ScienceDirect title Defensive buyers to participate actively in vulnerability marketsTITLE Economic solutions to improve cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets - ScienceDirect title Cities are becoming smarter and smarter.

The particular challenge of creating a carbon reduced future in democratic countries is that the measures proposed must be acceptable to the electorate. Such acceptability is fostered if carbon reduced ways of living are also felt to be wellbeing maximising. Thus the objective of the paper is to explore what kinds of cities people aspire to live in, to ascertain whether these aspirations align with or undermine carbon reduced ways of living, as well as personal wellbeing. Using a novel free associative technique, city aspirations are found to cluster around seven themes, encompassing physical and social aspects. Physically, people aspire to a city with a range of services and facilities, green and blue spaces, efficient transport, beauty and good design. Socially, people aspire to a sense of community and a safe environment. An exploration of these themes reveals that only a minority of the participants' aspirations for cities relate to lowering carbon or environmental wellbeing. Far more consensual is emphasis on, and a particular vision of, aspirations that will bring personal wellbeing. Furthermore, city dweller aspirations align with evidence concerning factors that maximise personal wellbeing but, far less, with those that produce low carbon ways of living. In order to shape a lower carbon future that city dwellers accept the potential convergence between environmental and personal wellbeing will need to be capitalised on: primarily aversion to pollution and enjoyment of communal green space.TITLE City dweller aspirations for cities of the future: How do environmental and personal wellbeing feature? - ScienceDirect title Dr. Smith is currently a lecturer in the Department of Psychology, University of Westminster, 115 New Cavendish Street, London, W1W 6UW, UK.TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title The paper shows the complexity of agreeing on a strategic level in a city context, where several interests are present.TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title The ethnographic methodology used gives a unique insight into the practice of strategy-making.TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title The paper illustrates paradoxes and tensions in organisations that impinge on the strategy-making process as well as the outcome.TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title The paper shows how drafting strategies is a means to question the ongoing processes within the organization.TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title The paper shows how some issues become excluded in discussions while others become strategically important.TITLE The paradoxes of city strategy practice: Why some issues become strategically important and others do not - ScienceDirect title Based on an in-depth study of a strategy initiative in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, this article addresses the practice of city strategy making.

Based on interviews with actors and experts involved in the development and implementation of the plan, the paper evaluates the role green leadership aspirations play in shaping urban climate change policy and how policy makers and stakeholders use policy to position the city and its greening initiatives locally and globally. In particular, it analyzes the role of competitive positioning and green leadership in sustainability initiatives and change within and beyond urban boundaries. While leadership suggests increased buy-in of residents and those involved in the implementation of the strategy and multiplication effects through learning within the region and between (peer) cities, it can also pose challenges as the interest in meeting leadership claims can impede more radical change through specific targets and implementation strategies and challenge other sustainability objectives.TITLE Positioning Vancouver through urban sustainability strategies?

When several types of data are available for this task, the optimal type should be chosen depending on the changes that need to be detected. However, data of the desired type are not always available, particularly historical data. In this study, we propose two methods for detecting changes in a city, which can be used in complement to process available data types and detect changes in selected targets. The first method estimates the presence of buildings by comparing street-level images and a 2D city map of buildings created at different points in time. This method uses the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique to reconstruct a point cloud of the structures of the city, and matches the point cloud with the 3D building structures recovered from its 2D map. While 2D city maps are available for most cities, most are not very accurate. Therefore, this method is designed to overcome these inaccuracies and thus is widely applicable. On the other hand, the method cannot detect the following types of scene change: wall paintings, buildings that were reconstructed and closely restored to their previous shape, pedestrians, cars, and vegetation. The second method uses a pair of street-level images that are roughly aligned with GPS data collected at different points in time to detect such scene changes. This method uses the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in combination with superpixel segmentation to address inaccurate image alignment and it also enables change detection with pixel-level accuracy. Additionally, the second method is scalable for large-scale estimation because it can quickly detect scene changes by merely using an image pair without performing large-scale SfM. The authors consider the proper use of these two methods to enable temporal city modeling in various situations. We experimentally apply these methods to cities damaged by the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 and the results show their effectiveness.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title We propose two methods for detecting city changes depending on available data.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title Presence of buildings is estimated by comparing street images and a 2D city map.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title Scene changes are estimated from an image pair roughly aligned with GPS data.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title The proper use of these images enables temporal city modeling in various situations.TITLE Temporal city modeling using street level imagery - ScienceDirect title Estimation of the temporal changes to a city is useful for city management, disaster recovery operations, and understanding natural phenomena.

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami).

ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.TITLE Distorting the volcano - ScienceDirectTITLE Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectTITLE Looking inside volcanoes with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectTITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA review on marine conglomerates interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis cause by volcano flank collapse.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectA comprehensive picture of the methods and general characteristics of these tsunami conglomerates.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the use of tsunami conglomerates for constraining numerical models of flank collapses and tsunamis.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectDiscussion on the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE Mega-tsunami conglomerates and flank collapses of ocean island volcanoes - ScienceDirectMarine conglomerates at high elevation on the flanks of ocean islands are usually interpreted as evidence of mega-tsunamis generated by volcano flank collapses, although their origin is sometimes debated (elevated littorals vs. tsunami). In this review, we introduce case studies of well-documented examples of tsunami conglomerates in Hawaii (Pacific Ocean), the Canary and Cape Verde Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean). Other less-documented marine conglomerates are also presented as tsunami candidates. Then, we build a comprehensive picture of the general characteristics of these conglomerates and the different methods that can be applied to date them. Different perspectives of research are proposed, especially on the use of tsunami conglomerates as proxies for better constraining numerical models of ocean island flank collapses and associated tsunamis. We also discuss the possible links between volcano growth, flank instability, and climate.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectThe existence of the Keelung Submarine Volcano off northern Taiwan is first reported.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectHigh Helium isotopic rations indicate the mantle source of the submarine volcano.TITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectTITLE The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectA pseudo 3-D shear-wave velocity model has been derived for Katla volcano.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectAn anomalously high VP/VS can be explained with velocity dispersion due to attenuation and a frequency content difference.TITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectTITLE Ambient-noise tomography of Katla volcano, south Iceland - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTilt cycles on Tungurahua explained by shear stress through viscous magma ascent.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectPressure sources cannot explain tilt cycles on Tungurahua.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDecrease in tilt before explosion explained by reduction in magma ascent velocity.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectShear stress partitioning explains anti-correlation of seismicity and tilt prior to eruption.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectStrategic placement of tilt-meters and seismometers for eruption forecasting.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns are observed on many volcanoes worldwide where seismic swarms and the tilt of the volcanic flanks provide sensitive tools to assess the state of volcanic activity. Ground deformation at active volcanoes is often interpreted as pressure changes in a magmatic reservoir, and tilt is simply translated accordingly into inflation and deflation of such a reservoir. Tilt data recorded by an instrument in the summit area of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador, however, show an intriguing and unexpected behaviour on several occasions: prior to a Vulcanian explosion when a pressurisation of the system would be expected, the tilt signal declines significantly, hence indicating depressurisation. At the same time, seismicity increases drastically. Envisaging that such a pattern could carry the potential to forecast Vulcanian explosions on Tungurahua, we use numerical modelling and reproduce the observed tilt patterns in both space and time. We demonstrate that the tilt signal can be more easily explained as caused by shear stress due to viscous flow resistance, rather than by pressurisation of the magmatic plumbing system. In general, our numerical models prove that if magma shear viscosity and ascent rate are high enough, the resulting shear stress is sufficient to generate a tilt signal as observed on Tungurahua. Furthermore, we address the interdependence of tilt and seismicity through shear stress partitioning and suggest that a joint interpretation of tilt and seismicity can shed new light on the eruption potential of silicic volcanoes.TITLE Understanding cyclic seismicity and ground deformation patterns at volcanoes: Intriguing lessons from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTagoro volcano shows variations in both pHF and TdFe(II) concentrations.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe TdFe(II) shows high temporal variability in a short time-scale.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectTdFe(II) was higher than in typical seawater areas not affected by the volcano.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectFe(II) oxidation rates were higher than expected in oligotrophic seawater.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro - ScienceDirectThe eruptive process that took place in October 2011 in the submarine volcano Tagoro off the Island of El Hierro and the subsequent degasification stage, five months later, have increased the concentration of TdFe(II) (Total dissolved iron(II)) in the waters nearest to the volcanic edifice. In order to detect any variation in concentrations of TdFe(II) due to hydrothermal emissions, three cruises were carried out two years after the eruptive process in October 2013, March 2014 and May 2015. The results from these cruises confirmed important positive anomalies in TdFe(II), which coincided with negatives anomalies in pHF,is (pH in free scale, at in situ conditions) located in the proximity of the main cone. Maximum values in TdFe(II) both at the surface, associated to chlorophyll a maximum, and at the sea bottom, were also observed, showing the important influence of organic complexation and particle re-suspension processes. Temporal variability studies were carried out over periods ranging from hours to days in the stations located over the main and two secondary cones in the volcanic edifice with positive anomalies in TdFe(II) concentrations and negative anomalies in pHF,is values. Observations showed an important variability in both pHF,is and TdFe(II) concentrations, which indicated the volcanic area was affected by a degasification process that remained in the volcano after the eruptive phase had ceased. Fe(II) oxidation kinetic studies were also undertaken in order to analyze the effects of the seawater properties in the proximities of the volcano on the oxidation rate constants and t1/2 (half-life time) of ferrous iron. The increased TdFe(II) concentrations and the low associated pHF,is values acted as an important fertilization event in the seawater around the Tagoro volcano at the Island of El Hierro providing optimal conditions for the regeneration of the area.TITLE Emissions of Fe(II) and its kinetic of oxidation at Tagoro submarine volcano, El Hierro -

ScienceDirectDushanzi mud volcano eruption is related to damage of gas reservoirs since the Neogene.TITLE Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta - ScienceDirectIn order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectAmong the considerable number of studies that can be carried out using muons, we pay specific attention to the radiography of volcanoes based on the same principle of the X-ray radiography of human body. Thanks to their high penetration capability, cosmic-ray muons can be used to reconstruct the density distribution of the interior of huge structures by measuring the attenuation induced by the material on the muon flux. In particular, the quantitative understanding of the inner structure of volcanoes is a key-point to forecast the dangerous stages of activity and mitigate volcanic hazards. The instrumental approach is currently based on the detection of muons crossing hodoscopes made up of scintillator planes. Unfortunately, these detectors are affected by a strong background comprised by accidental coincidence of vertical shower particles, horizontal high-energy electrons and upward going particles. We propose an alternative technique based on the detection of the Cherenkov light produced by muons. This can be achieved with an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope composed of a high reflectivity optical system that focus the Cherenkov light onto a multi-pixel focal camera with fast read-out electronics. The Cherenkov light emitted by a muon is imaged on the camera as an annular pattern which contains information to reconstruct the direction of the incident muon. We have estimated that using the Cherenkov imaging technique for muon radiography of volcanoes gives the advantage of a negligible background and improved spatial resolution, compared to the majority of the particle detectors. We present results of simulations based on a telescope with a positioning resolution of 13.5 m which corresponds to an acceptance of 9 cm2 sr. The telescope is located 1500 m far from a toy-model volcano, namely, a cone with a base diameter of 500 m and a height of 240 m. We test the feasibility of the proposed method by estimating the minimum number of observation nights needed to resolve inner empty conduits of different diameter.TITLE A new technique for probing the internal structure of volcanoes using cosmic-ray muons - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectWe tested the Random Forest algorithm for the automatic classification of seismic sources at Piton de la Fournaise.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification can reach 99% in the best case.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification remains high when the classifier is trained with data recorded at another station.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe rate of good identification collapsed when using the classifier trained with data from 2009-2011 to classify data from 2014-2015, probably due to a change in the physical mechanism of rockfalls.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectThe high rate of good identification, the robustness and the versatility of the RF make it an excellent candidate for an operational implementation.TITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectTITLE Automatic identification of rockfalls and volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano using a Random Forest algorithm - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano was established.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectNew EPMA glass data for pre-ME, ME, and post-ME eruptions was presented.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTephras from post-ME eruptions (AD 1403,1668, 1702) were identified.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectHolocene Changbaishan proximal reference glass data for tephrochronological studies around northeast Asia.TITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectTITLE Tephrostratigraphy of Changbaishan volcano, northeast China, since the mid-Holocene - ScienceDirectCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectTITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectAndesites and dacites relationship of the Tungurahua volcano have been examined from Pb isotopic compositions.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe heterogeneity of andesites reflects the complexity of the mantle wedge and/or deep crustal processes.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectThe Pb isotopic compositions of dacites are homogenized by the upper crustal assimilation.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectDacites at Tungurahua volcano are produced by AFC processes from andesites.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectVolcanic eruptions of intermediary and silica-rich magmas (andesites, dacites and rhyolites) in convergent arc settings generate voluminous and explosive eruptions that can strongly affect human activity and have significant environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand how these magmas are generated in order to anticipate their potential impact. At convergent margins, primitive magmas (primitive basalts and/or andesites) are derived from the mantle wedge and they are progressively modified by physical and chemical processes operating between the melting zone and the surface to produce silica-rich magmas.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectIn order to elucidate the relationship between andesites and dacites, we focus on Tungurahua volcano, located in the Ecuadorian Andes. We collected a set of samples comprising such lithologies that were erupted during the last 3000 year BP. This relatively short period of time allows us to assume that the geodynamic parameters remain constant. Petrology and major-trace element compositions of these lavas have already been examined, and so we performed a complementary Pb-Sr isotope study in order to determine the nature and origin of the components involved in andesite and dacite genesis. Sr isotopes range from 0.70417 to 0.70431, and Pb isotope compositions range from 18.889 to 19.154 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.658 to 15.696 for 207Pb/204Pb, and from 38.752 to 38.918 for 208Pb/204Pb. Dacites display a remarkably homogeneous Pb isotopic composition, with higher 206Pb/204Pb values for a given 207-208Pb/204Pb compared to andesites. Andesites show notable 207Pb/206Pb variations for a given SiO2 content, whereas dacites have lower and homogenous 207Pb/206Pb values. Andesite and dacite altogether plot in a roughly triangular distribution, with dacitic magmas systematically plotting at the high SiO2 and 87Sr/86Sr and low 207Pb/206Pb fields. Based on our new dataset, we show that at least 3 different components are required to explain the Tungurahua compositional and isotope variation: one corresponds to the mantle, the second has a deep origin (slab component or lower crust), and a mixture between these two components explains andesite heterogeneity. The third component is derived from the underlying upper continental crust. While andesites are derived from deep components, dacites are derived from the andesitic magmas that underwent an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process with incorporation of the local metamorphic basement. Finally, we used the geochemical and isotopic data to produce a model of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Tungurahua, consistent with geophysical and experimental petrology constraints. We conclude that melt migration and storage in the upper crust appears to be a key parameter for controlling volcanic behavior though time.TITLE The genetic relationship between andesites and dacites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador - ScienceDirectNow at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Roma, Italy.
